study of the history of the negroes of cincinnati is unusually important for the reason that from no other annals do we get such striking evidence that the colored people generally thrive when encouraged by their white neighbors this story is otherwise significant when we consider the fact that about a fourth of the persons of color settling in the state of ohio during the first half of the last century made their homes in this city situated on a north bend of the ohio where commerce breaks bulk cincinnati rapidly developed attracting both foreigners and americans among whom were not a few negroes exactly how many persons of color were in this city during the first decade of the nineteenth century is not yet known it has been said that there were no negroes in hamilton county in 18001 it is evident too that the real exodus of free negroes and fugitives from the south to the northwest territory did not begin prior to 1815 although their attention had been earlier directed to this section as a more desirable place for colonization than the shores of africa2 as the reaction following the era of good feeling toward the negroes during the revolutionary period had not reached its climax free persons of color had been content to remain in the south3 the unexpected immigration of these negroes into this section and the last bold effort made to drive them out marked epochs in their history in this city the history of these people prior to the civil war therefore falls into three periods one of toleration from 1800 to 1826 one of persecution from 1826 to 1841 and one of amelioration from 1841 to 1861 in the beginning the negroes were not a live issue in cincinnati the question of their settlement in that community was debated but resulted in great diversity of opinion rather than a fixedness of judgment among the citizens the question came up in the constitutional convention of 1802 and provoked some discussion but reaching no decision the convention simply left the negroes out of the pale of the newly organized body politic discriminating against them together with indians and foreigners by incorporating the word white into the fundamental law4 the legislature to which the disposition of this question was left however took it up in 1804 to calm the fears of those who had more seriously considered the socalled menace of negro immigration this body enacted a law providing that no negro or mulatto should be allowed to remain permanently in that state unless he could furnish a certificate of freedom issued by some court in the united states negroes then living there had to be registered before the following june giving the names of their children no man could employ a negro who could not show such a certificate hiring a delinquent black or harboring or hindering the capture of a runaway was punishable by a fine of 50 and the owner of a fugitive thus illegally employed could recover fifty cents a day for the services of his slave5 as the fear of negro immigration increased the law of 1804 was found to be inadequate in 1807 therefore the legislature enacted another measure providing that no negro should be permitted to settle in ohio unless he could within twenty days give a bond to the amount of 500 guaranteeing his good behavior and support the fine for concealing a fugitive was raised from 50 to 100 one half of which should go to the informer negro evidence against the white man was prohibited6 this law together with that of 1830 making the negro ineligible for service in the state militia that of 1831 depriving persons of color of the privilege of serving upon juries and that of 1838 prohibiting the education of colored children at the expense of the state constituted what were known as the black laws7 up to 1826 however the negroes of cincinnati had not become a cause of much trouble very little mention of them is made in the records of this period they were not wanted in this city but were tolerated as a negligible factor d b warden a traveler through the west in 1819 observed that the blacks of cincinnati were goodhumoured garrulous and profligate generally disinclined to laborious occupations and prone to the performance of light and menial drudgery here the traveler was taking effect for cause some few said he exercise the humbler trades and some appear to have formed a correct conception of the objects and value of property and are both industrious and economical a large proportion of them are reputed and perhaps correctly to be habituated to petit larceny but this had not become a grave offence for he said that not more than one individual had been corporally punished by the courts since the settlement of the town8 when however the south reached the conclusion that free negroes were an evil and quakers and philanthropists began to direct these unfortunates to the northwest territory for colonization a great commotion arose in southern ohio and especially in cincinnati9 how rapid this movement was may be best observed by noticing the statistics of this period there were 337 negroes in ohio in 1800 1890 in 1810 4723 in 1820 9586 in 1830 17342 in 1840 and 25279 in 185010 now cincinnati had 410 negroes in 181911 690 in 182612 2255 in 184013 and 3237 in 185014 it was during the period between 1826 and 1840 that cincinnati had to grapple with the problem of the immigrating negroes and the poor whites from the uplands of virginia and kentucky with some illinformed persons the question was whether that section should be settled by white men or negroes the situation became more alarming when the southern philanthropic minority sometimes afforded a man like a master of pittsylvania county virginia who settled 70 freedmen in lawrence county ohio in one day15 it became unusually acute in cincinnati because of the close social and commercial relations between that city and the slave states early in the nineteenth century cincinnati became a manufacturing center to which the south learned to look for supplies of machinery implements furniture and food16 the business men prospering thereby were not advocates of slavery but rather than lose trade by acquiring the reputation of harboring fugitive slaves or frightening away whites by encouraging the immigration of negroes they began to assume the attitude of driving the latter from those parts from this time until the forties the negroes were a real issue in cincinnati during the late twenties they not only had to suffer from the legal disabilities provided in the black laws but had to withstand the humiliation of a rigid social ostracism17 they were regarded as intruders and denounced as an idle profligate and criminal class with whom a selfrespecting white man could not afford to associate their children were not permitted to attend the public schools and few persons braved the inconveniences of living under the stigma of teaching a nigger school negroes were not welcome in the white churches and when they secured admission thereto they had to go to the black pew colored ministers were treated with very little consideration by the white clergy as they feared that they might lose caste and be compelled to give up their churches the colored people made little or no effort to go to white theaters or hotels and did not attempt to ride in public conveyances on equal footing with members of the other race not even white and colored children dared to play together to the extent that such was permitted in the south18 this situation became more serious when it extended to pursuits of labor white laborers there as in other northern cities during this period easily reached the position of thinking that it was a disgrace to work with negroes this prejudice was so much more inconvenient to the negroes of cincinnati than elsewhere because of the fact that most of the menial labor in that city was done by germans and irishmen now since the negroes could not follow ordinary menial occupations there was nothing left them but the lowest form of drudgery for which employers often preferred colored women it was therefore necessary in some cases for the mother to earn the living for the family because the father could get nothing to do a colored man could not serve as an ordinary drayman or porter without subjecting his employer to a heavy penalty19 the trades unions were then proscribing the employment of colored mechanics many who had worked at skilled labor were by this prejudice forced to do drudgery or find employment in other cities the president of a mechanical association was publicly tried in 1830 by that organization for the crime of assisting a colored youth to learn a trade20 a young man of high character who had at the cabinetmaking trade in kentucky saved enough to purchase his freedom came to cincinnati about this time seeking employment he finally found a position in a shop conducted by an englishman on entering the establishment however the workmen threw down their tools declaring that the negro had to leave or that they would the unfortunate intruder was accordingly dismissed he then entered the employ of a slaveholder who at the close of the negros two years of service at common labor discovered that the black was a mechanic the employer then procured work for him as a rough carpenter by dint of perseverance and industry this negro within a few years became a master workman employing at times six or eight men but he never received a single job of work from a nativeborn citizen from a free state21 the hardships of the negroes of this city however had just begun the growth of a prejudiced public opinion led not only to legal proscription and social ostracism but also to open persecution with the cries of the southerners for the return of fugitives and the request of white immigrants for the exclusion of negroes from that section came the demand to solve the problem by enforcing the black laws among certain indulgent officials these enactments had been allowed to fall into desuetude these very demands however brought forward friends as well as enemies of the colored people their first clash was testing the constitutionality of the law of 1807 when the question came up before the supreme court this measure was upheld22 encouraged by such support the foes of the negroes forced an execution of the law the courts at first hesitated but finally took the position that the will of the people should be obeyed the negroes asked for ninety days to comply with the law and were given sixty when the allotted time had expired however many of them had not given bonds as required the only thing to do then was to force them to leave the city the officials again hesitated but a mob quickly formed to relieve them of the work this was the riot of 1829 bands of ruffians held sway in the city for three days as the police were unable or unwilling to restore order negroes were insulted on the streets attacked in their homes and even killed about a thousand or twelve hundred of them found it advisable to leave for canada west where they established the settlement known as wilberforce23 this upheaval though unusually alarming was not altogether a bad omen it was due not only to the demands which the south was making upon the north and the fear of the loss of southern trade but also to the rise of the abolition societies the growth of which such a riotous condition as this had materially fostered in a word it was the sequel of the struggle between the proslavery and the antislavery elements of the city this was the time when the friends of the negroes were doing most for them instead of frightening them away a group of respectable white men in that community were beginning to think that they should be trained to live there as useful citizens several schools and churches for them were established the negroes themselves provided for their own first school about 1820 but one mr wing had sufficient courage to admit persons of color to his evening classes after their first efforts had failed by 1834 many of the colored people were receiving systematic instruction24 to some enemies of these dependents it seemed that the tide was about to turn in favor of the despised cause negroes began to raise sums adequate to their elementary education and the students of lane seminary supplemented these efforts by establishing a colored mission school which offered more advanced courses and lectures on scientific subjects twice a week these students however soon found themselves far in advance of public opinion25 they were censured by the faculty and to find a more congenial center for their operations they had to go to oberlin in the western reserve where a larger number of persons had become interested in the cause of the despised and rejected of men during the years from 1833 to 1836 the situation in cincinnati grew worse because of the still larger influx of negroes driven from the south by intolerable conditions incident to the reaction against the race to solve this problem various schemes were brought forth augustus wattles tells us that he appeared in cincinnati about this time and induced numbers of the negroes to go to mercer county ohio where they took up 30000 acres of land26 others went to indiana and purchased large tracts on the public domain27 such a method however seemed rather slow to the militant proslavery leaders who had learned not only to treat the negroes as an evil but to denounce in the same manner the increasing number of abolitionists by whom it was said the negroes were encouraged to immigrate into the state the spirit of the proslavery sympathizers was well exhibited in the upheaval which soon followed this was the riot of july 30 1836 it was an effort to destroy the abolition organ the philanthropist edited by james g birney a southerner who had brought his slaves from huntsville alabama to kentucky and freed them the mob formed in the morning went to the office of the philanthropist destroyed what printed matter they could find threw the type into the street and broke up the press they then proceeded to the home of the printer mr pugh but finding no questionable matter there they left it undisturbed the homes of james g birney mr donaldson and dr colby were also threatened the next homes to be attacked were those of church alley the negro quarter but when two guns were fired upon the assailants they withdrew it was reported that one man was shot but this has never been proved the mob hesitated some time before attacking these houses again several of the rioters declaring that they did not care to endanger their lives a second onset was made but it was discovered that the negroes had deserted the quarter on finding the houses empty the assailants destroyed their contents28 yet undaunted by this persistent opposition the negroes of cincinnati achieved so much during the years between 1835 and 1840 that they deserved to be ranked among the most progressive people of the world29 their friends endeavored to enable them through schools churches and industries to embrace every opportunity to rise these 2255 negroes accumulated largely during this period 209000 worth of property exclusive of personal effects and three churches valued at 19000 some of this wealth consisted of land purchased in ohio and indiana furthermore in 1839 certain colored men of the city organized the iron chest company a real estate firm which built three brick buildings and rented them to white men one man who a few years prior to 1840 had thought it useless to accumulate wealth from which he might be driven away had changed his mind and purchased 6000 worth of real estate another negro who had paid 5000 for himself and family had bought a home worth 800 or 1000 a freedman who was a slave until he was twentyfour years old then had two lots worth 10000 paid a tax of 40 and had 320 acres of land in mercer county another who was worth only 3000 in 1836 had seven houses in cincinnati 400 acres of land in indiana and another tract in the same county he was worth 12000 or 15000 a woman who was a slave until she was thirty was then worth 2000 she had also come into potential possession of two houses on which a white lawyer had given her a mortgage to secure the payment of 2000 borrowed from this thrifty woman another negro who was on the auction block in 1832 had spent 2600 purchasing himself and family and had bought two brick houses worth 6000 and 560 acres of land in mercer county said to be worth 250030 this unusual progress had been promoted by two forces the development of the steamboat as a factor in transportation and the rise of the negro mechanic negroes employed on vessels as servants to the travelling public amassed large sums received in the form of tips furthermore the fortunate few constituting the stewards of these vessels could by placing contracts for supplies and using business methods realize handsome incomes many negroes thus enriched purchased real estate and went into business in cincinnati31 the other force the rise of the negro mechanic was made possible by overcoming much of the prejudice which had at first been encountered a great change in this respect had taken place in cincinnati by 1840 many who had been forced to work as menial laborers then had the opportunity to show their usefulness to their families and to the community colored mechanics were then getting as much skilled labor as they could do it was not uncommon for white artisans to solicit employment of colored men because they had the reputation of being better paymasters than master workmen of the more favored race32 white mechanics not only worked with colored men but often associated with them patronized the same barber shop and went to the same places of amusement33 in this prosperous condition the negroes could help themselves prior to this period they had been unable to make any sacrifices for charity and education only 150 of the 1000 raised for negro education in 1835 was contributed by persons of color in 1839 however the colored people raised 88930 for this purpose and thanks to their economic progress this task was not so difficult as that of raising the 150 in 1835 they were then spending considerable amounts for evening and writing schools attended by seventyfive persons chiefly adults in 1840 reverend mr denham and mr goodwin had in their schools sixtyfive pupils each paying 3 per quarter and miss merrill a school of fortyseven pupils paying the same tuition in all the colored people were paying these teachers about 1300 a year the only help the negroes were then receiving was that from the ladies antislavery society which employed one miss seymour at a salary of 300 a year to instruct fiftyfour pupils moreover the colored people were giving liberally to objects of charity some negroes burned out in 1839 were promptly relieved by members of their own race a white family in distress was befriended by a colored woman the negroes contributed also to the support of missionaries in jamaica and during the years from 1836 to 1840 assisted twentyfive emancipated slaves on their way from cincinnati to mercer county ohio34 during this period they had made progress in other than material things their improvement in religion and morals was remarkable they then had four flourishing sabbath schools with 310 regular attendants one baptist and two methodist churches with a membership of 800 a total abstinence temperance society for adults numbering 450 and a sabbath school or youths society of 180 members a few of these violated their pledges but when we consider the fact that one fourth of the entire colored population belonged to temperance organizations while less than one tenth of the whites were thus connected we must admit that this was no mean achievement among the negroes public sentiment was then such that no colored man could openly sell intoxicating drinks this growing temperance was exhibited too in the decreasing fondness for dress and finery there was less tendency to strive merely to get a fine suit of clothes and exhibit ones self on the streets places of vice were not so much frequented and barber shops which on sundays formerly became a rendezvous for the idle and the garrulous were with few exceptions closed by 1840 this influence of the religious organizations reached also beyond the limits of cincinnati a theological student from the state of new york said after spending some time in new orleans that the influence of the elevation of the colored people of cincinnati was felt all the way down the river travelers often spoke of the difference in the appearance of barbers and waiters on the boats35 it was in fact a brighter day for the colored people in 1840 an observer said that they had improved faster than any other people in the city the cincinnati gazette after characterizing certain negroes as being imprudent and vicious said of others many of these are peaceable and industrious raising respectable families and acquiring property36 mr james h perkins a respectable citizen of the city asserted that the day school which the colored children attended had shown by examination that it was as good as any other in the city he said further there is no question i presume that the colored population of cincinnati oppressed as it has been by our state laws as well as by prejudice has risen more rapidly than almost any other people in any part of the world37 within three or four years their property had more than doubled their schools had become firmly established and their churches and sunday schools had grown as rapidly as any other religious institutions in the city trusting to good conduct and character they had risen to a prosperous position in the eyes of those whose prejudices would allow them to look through the skin to the soul38 the colored people had had too many enemies in cincinnati however to expect that they had overcome all opposition the prejudice of certain labor groups against the negroes increased in proportion to the prosperity of the latter that they had been able to do as well as they had was due to the lack of strength on the part of the labor organizations then forming to counteract the sentiment of fair play for the negroes their labor competed directly with that of the whites and began again to excite jealousy and heart burning39 the germans who were generally toiling up from poverty seemed to exhibit less prejudice but the unfortunate irish bore it grievously that even a few negroes should outstrip some of their race in the economic struggle in 1841 there followed several clashes which aggravated the situation in the month of june one burnett referred to as a mischievous and swaggering englishman running a cake shop had harbored a runaway slave when a man named mccalla his reputed master came with an officer to reclaim the fugitive burnett and his family resisted them the burnetts were committed to answer for this infraction of the law and finally were adequately punished the proslavery mob which had gathered undertook to destroy their home but the officials prevented them besides early in august according to a report a german citizen defending his blackberry patch near the city was attacked by two negroes and stabbed so severely that he died then about three weeks thereafter according to another rumor a very respectable lady was insultingly accosted by two colored men and when she began to flee two others rudely thrust themselves before her on the sidewalk but in this case as in most others growing out of rumors no one could ever say who the lady or her socalled assailants were at the same time too the situation was further aggravated by an almost sudden influx of irresponsible negroes from various parts increasing the number of those engaged in noisy frolics which had become a nuisance to certain white neighbors40 accordingly on tuesday the twentyninth of august there broke out on the corner of sixth and broadway a quarrel in which two or three persons were wounded on the following night the fracas was renewed a group of ruffians attacked the dumas hotel a colored establishment on mccallister street demanding the surrender of a negro who they believed was concealed there as the negroes of the neighborhood came to the assistance of their friends in the hotel the mob had to withdraw on thursday night there took place another clash between a group of young men and boys and a few negroes who seriously wounded one or two of the former on friday evening the mob incited to riotous acts by an influx of white ruffians seemingly from the steamboats and the kentucky side of the river openly assembled in fifth street market without being molested by the police armed themselves and marched to broadway and sixth street shouting and swearing they attacked a colored confectionery store near by demolishing its doors and windows james w piatt an influential citizen and the mayor then addressed the disorderly persons vainly exhorting them to peace and obedience to the law moved by passionate entreaties to execute their poorly prepared plan the assailants advanced and attacked the negroes with stones the blacks however had not been idle they had secured sufficient guns and ammunition to fire into the mob such a volley that it had to fall back the aggressors rallied again however only to be in like manner repulsed men were wounded on both sides and carried off and reported dead the negroes advanced courageously and according to a reporter fired down the street into the mass of ruffians causing a hasty retreat this mle continued until about one oclock when a part of the mob secured an iron six pounder hauled it to the place of combat against the exhortations of the powerless mayor and fired on the negroes with this unusual advantage the blacks were forced to retreat many of them going to the hills about two oclock the mayor of the city brought out a portion of the military which succeeded in holding the mob at bay41 on the next day the colored people in the district under fire were surrounded by sentinels and put under martial law indignation meetings of lawabiding citizens were held on saturday to pass resolutions denouncing abolitionists and mobs and making an appeal to the people and the civil authorities to uphold the law the negroes also held a meeting and respectfully assured the mayor and citizens that they would use every effort to conduct themselves orderly and expressed their readiness to give bond according to the law of 1807 or leave the city quietly within a specified time but these steps availed little when the police winked at this violence the rioters boldly occupied the streets without arrest and continued their work until sunday the mayor sheriff and marshal went to the battle ground about three oclock but the mob still had control the officers could not even remove those negroes who complied with the law of leaving the authorities finally hit upon the scheme of decreasing the excitement by inducing about 300 colored men to go to jail for security after they had been assured that their wives and children would be protected the negroes consented and were accordingly committed but the cowardly element again attacked these helpless dependents like savages at the same time other rioters stormed the office of the philanthropist and broke up the press the mob continued its work until it dispersed from mere exhaustion the governor finally came to the city and issued a proclamation setting forth the gravity of the situation the citizens and civil authorities rallied to his support and strong patrols prevented further disorder42 it is impossible to say exactly how many were killed and wounded on either side it is probable that several were killed and twenty or thirty variously wounded though but few dangerously forty of the mob were arrested and imprisoned exactly what was done with all of them is not yet known it seems that few if any of them however were severely punished the negroes who had been committed for safe keeping were thereafter disposed of in various ways some were discharged on certificates of nativity others gave bond for their support and good behavior a few were dismissed as nonresidents a number of them were discharged by a justice of the court of common pleas and the rest were held indefinitely43 this upheaval had two important results the enemies of the negroes were convinced that there were sufficient lawabiding citizens to secure to the refugees protection from mob violence and because of these riots their sympathizers became more attached to the objects of their philanthropy abolitionists free soilers and whigs fearlessly attacked the laws which kept the negroes under legal and economic disabilities petitions praying that these measures be repealed were sent to the legislature the proslavery element of the state however was equally militant the legislators therefore had to consider such questions as extradition and immigration state aid and colonization the employment of colored men in the militia service the extension of the elective franchise and the admission of colored children to the public schools44 most of these black laws remained until after the war but in 1848 they were so modified as to give the negroes legal standing in courts and to provide for their children such education as a school tax on the property of colored persons would allow45 and further changed in 184946 so as to make the provision for education more effective the question of repealing the other oppressive laws came up in the convention of 1850 it seemed that the cause of the negroes had made much progress in that a larger number had begun to speak for them but practically all of the members of the convention who stood for the negroes were from the western reserve after much heated discussion the colored people were by a large majority of votes still left under the disabilities of being disqualified to sit on juries unable to obtain a legal residence so as to enter a charitable institution supported by the state and denied admission to public schools established for white children47 the greatest problem of the negroes however was one of education there were more persons interested in furnishing them facilities of education than in repealing the prohibitive measures feeling that the other matters would adjust themselves after giving them adequate training but it required some time and effort yet before much could be effected in cincinnati because of the sympathizers with the south the mere passing of the law of 1849 did not prove to be altogether a victory complying with the provisions of this act the negroes elected trustees organized a system and employed teachers relying on the money allotted them by the law on the basis of a per capita division of the school fund received by the board of education so great was the prejudice of people of the city that the school officials refused to turn over the required funds on the grounds that the colored trustees were not electors and therefore could not be officeholders qualified to receive and disburse funds under the leadership of john i gaines therefore the trustees called an indignation meeting and raised sufficient money to employ flamen ball an attorney to secure a writ of mandamus the case was contested by the city officials even in the supreme court which decided against the officious whites48 this decision did not solve the whole problem in cincinnati the amount raised was small and even had it been adequate to employ teachers they were handicapped by another decision that no portion of it could be used for building schoolhouses after a short period of accomplishing practically nothing the law was amended in 185349 so as to transfer the control of such schools to the managers of the white system this was taken as a reflection on the blacks of the city and tended to make them refuse to cooperate with the white board on account of the failure of this body to act effectively prior to 1856 the people of color were again given power to elect their own trustees50 during this contest certain negroes of cincinnati were endeavoring to make good their claim to equal rights in the public schools acting upon this contention a colored man sent his son to a public school which on account of his presence became a center of unusual excitement isabella newhall the teacher to whom he went immediately complained to the board of education requesting that he be expelled because of his color after due deliberation the board of education decided by a vote of 15 to 10 that the colored pupil would have to withdraw thereupon two members of that body residing in the district of the timorous teacher resigned51 many negroes belonging to the mulatto class however were more successful in getting into the white schools in 1849 certain parents complained that children of color were being admitted to the public schools and in fact there were in one of them two daughters of a white father and a mulatto mother on complaining about this to the principal of the school in question the indignant patrons were asked to point out the undesirable pupils they could not for says sir charles lyell the two girls were not only among the best pupils but better looking and less dark than many of the other pupils52 thereafter however much progress in the education of the colored people among themselves was noted by 1844 they had six schools of their own and before the war two wellsupported public schools53 among their teachers were such useful persons as mrs m j corbin miss lucy blackburn miss anne ryall miss virginia c tilley miss martha e anderson william h parham william r casey john g mitchell and peter h clark54 the pupils were showing their appreciation by regular attendance excellent deportment and progress in the acquisition of knowledge speaking of these negroes in 1855 john p foote said that they shared with the white citizens that respect for education and the diffusion of knowledge which has been one of their characteristics and that they had therefore been more generally intelligent than free persons of color not only in other parts of this country but in all other parts of the world55 it was in appreciation of the worth of this class to the community that in 184456 nicholas longworth helped them to establish an orphan asylum and in 1858 built for them a comfortable school building leasing it with a privilege of purchasing it within four years57 they met these requirements within the stipulated time and in 1859 secured through other agencies the construction of another building in the western portion of the city the most successful of these schools however was the gilmore high school a private institution founded by an english clergyman this institution offered instruction in the fundamentals and in some vocational studies it was supported liberally by the benevolent element of the white people and patronized and appreciated by the negroes as the first and only institution offering them the opportunity for thorough training it became popular throughout the country attracting negroes from as far south as new orleans58 rich southern planters found it convenient to have their mulatto children educated in this high school59 the work of these schools was substantially supplemented by that of the colored churches they directed their attention not only to moral and religious welfare of the colored people but also to their mental development through their wellattended sundayschools these institutions furnished many negroes of all classes the facilities of elementary education such opportunities were offered at the baker street baptist church the third street baptist church the colored christian church the new street methodist church and the african methodist church among the preachers then promoting this cause were john warren rufus conrad henry simpson and wallace shelton many of the old citizens of cincinnati often refer with pride to the valuable services rendered by these leaders in things economic the negroes were exceptionally prosperous after the forties cincinnati had then become a noted porkpacking and manufacturing center the increasing canal and river traffic and finally the rise of the railroad system tended to make it thrive more than ever many colored men grew up with the city a negro had in the east end on calvert street a large cooperage establishment which made barrels for the packers knight and bell were successful contractors noted for their skill and integrity and employed by the best white people of the city robert harlan made considerable money buying and selling race horses thompson cooley had a successful pickling establishment on broadway a v thompson a colored tailor conducted a thriving business j pressley and thomas ball were the wellknown photographers of the city established in a handsomely furnished modern gallery which was patronized by some of the wealthiest people samuel t wilcox who owed his success to his position as a steward on an ohio river line thereafter went into the grocery business and built up such a large trade among the aristocratic families that he accumulated 59000 worth of property by 185960 a more useful negro had for years been toiling upward in this city this man was henry boyd a kentucky freedman who had helped to overcome the prejudice against colored mechanics in that city by exhibiting the highest efficiency he patented a corded bed which became very popular especially in the southwest with this article he built up a creditable manufacturing business employing from 18 to 25 white and colored men61 he was therefore known as one of the desirable men of the city two things however seemingly interfered with his business in the first place certain white men who became jealous of his success burned him out and the insurance companies refused to carry him any longer moreover having to do chiefly with white men he was charged by his people with favoring the miscegenation of races whether or not this was well founded is not yet known but his children and grandchildren did marry whites and were lost in the socalled superior race a much more interesting negro appeared in cincinnati however in 1847 this was robert gordon formerly the slave of a rich yachtsman of richmond virginia his master turned over to him a coal yard which he handled so faithfully that his owner gave him all of the slack resulting from the handling of the coal this he sold to the local manufacturers and blacksmiths of the city accumulating thereby in the course of time thousands of dollars he purchased himself in 1846 and set out for free soil he went first to philadelphia and then to newburyport but finding that these places did not suit him he proceeded to cincinnati he arrived there with 15000 some of which he immediately invested in the coal business in which he had already achieved marked success he employed bookkeepers had his own wagons built his own docks on the river and bought coal by barges62 unwilling to see this negro do so well the white coal dealers endeavored to force him out of the business by lowering the price to the extent that he could not afford to sell they did not know of his acumen and the large amount of capital at his disposal he sent to the coal yards of his competitors mulattoes who could pass for white using them to fill his current orders from his foes supplies that he might save his own coal for the convenient day in the course of a few months the river and all the canals by which coal was brought to cincinnati froze up and remained so until spring gordon was then able to dispose of his coal at a higher price than it had ever been sold in that city this so increased his wealth and added to his reputation that no one thereafter thought of opposing him gordon continued in the coal business until 1865 when he retired during the civil war he invested his money in united states bonds when these bonds were called in he invested in real estate on walnut hills which he held until his death in 1884 this estate descended to his daughter virginia ann gordon who married george h jackson a descendant of slaves in the custis family of arlington virginia mr jackson is now a resident of chicago and is managing this estate63 having lived through the antebellum and subsequent periods mr jackson has been made to wonder whether the negroes of cincinnati are doing as well today as gordon and his colaborers were this question requires some attention but an inquiry as to exactly what

fannie m richards1 the state of virginia has been the home of distinguished persons of both sexes of the white and colored races a dissertation on the noted colored women of virginia would find a small circle of readers but would nevertheless contain interesting accounts of some of the most important achievements of the people of that state the story of maria louise moorerichards would be a large chapter of such a narrative she was born of white and negro parentage in fredericksburg virginia in 1800 her father was edwin moore a scotchman of edinburgh her mother was a free woman of color born in toronto when it was called york exactly how they came to fredericksburg is not known it seems however that they had been well established in that city when maria louise moore was born this woman was fortunate in coming into the world at that time so general had been the efforts for the elevation of the colored people that free negroes had many of the privileges later given only to white people virginia then and for a long time thereafter ranked among the commonwealths most liberal toward the negro the dissemination of information among them was not then restricted private teaching of slaves was common and progressive communities maintained colored schools1a in fredericksburg such opportunities were not rare the parents of maria louise moore fortunately associated with the free negroes who constituted an industrial class with adequate means to provide for the thorough training of their children miss moore therefore easily acquired the rudiments of education and attained some distinction as a student of history in 1820 miss moore was married to adolphe richards a native of the island of guadaloupe he was a latin of some negro blood had noble ancestry and had led an honorable career educated in london and resident in guadaloupe he spoke both english and french fluently because of poor health in later years he was directed by his friends to the salubrious climate of virginia he settled at fredericksburg where he soon became captivated by the charms of the talented maria louise moore on learning of his marriage his people and friends marveled that a man of his standing had married a colored woman or a southern woman at all adjusting himself to this new environment mr richards opened a shop for woodturning painting and glazing it is highly probable that he learned these trades in the west indies but having adequate means to maintain himself he had not depended on his mechanical skill in fredericksburg he had the respect and support of the best white people passing as one of such welltodo free negroes as the lees the cooks the de baptistes who were contractors and the williamses who were contractors and brickmakers his success was in a large measure due to the good standing of the family of mrs richards and to the wisdom with which she directed this west indian in his new environment they had in all fourteen children the training of whom was largely the work of the mother all of them were well grounded in the rudiments of education and given a taste for higher things in the course of time when the family grew larger the task of educating them grew more arduous some of them probably attended the school conducted by a scotchirishman in the home of richard de baptiste when the reaction against the teaching of negroes effected the closing of the colored schools in virginia this one continued clandestinely for many years determined to have her children better educated mrs richards sent one of her sons to a school conducted by mrs beecham a remarkable english woman assisted by her daughter these women were bent on doing what they could to evade the law interpreted as prohibiting any one from either sitting or standing to teach a black to read they therefore gathered the colored children around them while they lay prostrate on the couch to teach them for further evasion they kept on hand splinters of wood which they had the children dip into a match preparation and use with a flint for ignition to make it appear that they were showing them how to make matches when this scheme seemed impracticable one of the boys was sent to washington in the district of columbia to attend the school maintained by john f cook a successful educator and founder of the fifteenth street presbyterian church this young man was then running the risk of expatriation for virginia had in 1838 passed a law prohibiting the return to that state of those negroes who after the prohibition of their education had begun to attend schools in other parts2 it was because of these conditions that in 1851 when her husband died mrs richards sold out her property and set out to find a better home in detroit michigan some of the best white people of fredericksburg commended her for this step saying that she was too respectable a woman to suffer such humiliation as the reaction had entailed upon persons of her race3 she was followed by practically all of the best free negroes of fredericksburg among these were the lees the cooks the williamses and the de baptistes a few years later this group attracted the pelham family from petersburg they too had tired of seeing their rights gradually taken away and therefore transplanted themselves to detroit the attitude of the people of detroit toward immigrating negroes had been reflected by the position the people of that section had taken from the time of the earliest settlements slavery was prohibited by the ordinance of 1787 in 1807 there arose a case in which a woman was required to answer for the possession of two slaves her contention was that they were slaves on british territory at the time of the surrender of the post in 1796 and that jays treaty assured them to her her contention was sustained4 a few days later a resident of canada attempted under this ruling to secure the arrest and return of some mulatto and indian slaves who had escaped from canada the court held that slavery did not exist in michigan except in the case of slaves in the possession of the british settlers within the northwest territory july 11 1796 and that there was no obligation to give up fugitives from a foreign jurisdiction an effort was made to take the slaves by force but the agent of the owner was tarred and feathered4 generally speaking detroit adhered to this position4a in 1827 there was passed an act providing for the registry of the names of all colored persons requiring the possession of a certificate showing that they were free and a bond in the sum of 500 for their good behavior5 this law was obnoxious to the growing sentiment of freedom in detroit and was not enforced until the riot of 1833 this uprising was an attack on the negroes because a courageous group of them had effected the rescue and escape of one thornton blackburn and his wife who had been arrested by the sheriff as alleged fugitives from kentucky6 the antislavery feeling considerably increased thereafter the detroit antislavery society was formed in 1837 other societies to secure the relief and escape of slaves quickly followed and still another was organized to find employment and purchase homes for refugees7 this change of sentiment is further evidenced by the fact that in 1850 it was necessary to call out the three companies of volunteers to quell an incipient riot occasioned by the arrest and attempt to return a runaway slave in accordance with the fugitive slave law save the general troubles incident to the draft riots of the northern cities of 18638 detroit maintained this benevolent attitude toward negroes seeking refuge in this favorable community the richards colony easily prospered the lees well established themselves in their northern homes and soon won the respect of the community most of the members of the williams family confined themselves to their trade of bricklaying and amassed considerable wealth one of mr williamss daughters married a welltodo waring living then at wauseon ohio another became the wife of one chappe who is now a stenographer in detroit and the third united in matrimony with james h cole who became the head of a welltodo family of detroit then there were the cooks descending from lomax b cook a broker of no little business ability will marion cook the musician belongs to this family the de baptistes too were among the first to get a foothold in this new environment and prospered materially from their experience and knowledge acquired in fredericksburg as contractors8a from this group came richard de baptiste who in his day was the most noted colored baptist preacher in the northwest the pelhams were no less successful in establishing themselves in the economic world they enjoyed a high reputation in the community and had the sympathy and cooperation of the influential white people in the city out of this family came robert a pelham for years editor of a weekly in detroit and from 1901 to the present time an employee of the federal government in washington9 the children of mrs richards were in no sense inferior to the descendants of the other families she lived to see her work bear fruit in the distinguished services they rendered and the desirable connections which they made after the civil war her daughter julia married thomas f carey who after conducting a business for some years in new york moved to toronto where he died from this union came the wife of d augustus straker her daughter evalina married dr joseph ferguson who prior to 1861 lived in richmond virginia uniting the three occupations of leecher cupper and barber this led to his coming to detroit to study medicine he was graduated there and practiced for many years in that city before the civil war her son john d richards was sent to richmond to learn a trade there he met and became the lifelong friend of judge george l ruffin who was then living in that city10 the most prominent and the most useful person to emerge from this group of pioneering negroes was her daughter fannie m richards she was born in fredericksburg virginia october 1 1841 as her people left that state when she was quite young she did not see so much of the intolerable conditions as did the older members of the family miss richards was successful in getting an early start in education desiring to have better training than what was then given to persons of color in detroit she went to toronto there she studied english history drawing and needlework in later years she attended the teachers training school in detroit her first thought was to take up teaching that she might do something to elevate her people she therefore opened a private school in 1863 doing a higher grade of work than that then undertaken in the public schools about 1862 however a colored public school had been opened by a white man named whitbeck miss richards began to think that she should have such a school herself her story as to how she realized her ambition is very interesting going to her private school one morning she saw a carpenter repairing a building upon inquiry she learned that it was to be opened as colored school number 2 she went immediately to william d wilkins a member of the board of education who impressed with the personality of the young woman escorted her to the office of superintendent of schools duane dotty after some discussion of the matter miss richards filed an application assured that she would be notified to take the next examination at the appointed time she presented herself along with several other applicants who hoped to obtain the position miss richards ranked highest and was notified to report for duty the following september early one morning she proceeded to her private school in time to inform her forty pupils of the desirable change and conducted them in a body to their new home miss richards taught in this building until 1871 when by a liberal interpretation of the courts the schools were mixed by ignoring race distinction wherever it occurred in the school laws of michigan she was then transferred to the everett school where she remained until last june when she was retired on a pension after having served that system half a century although she taught very few colored children she said to a reporter several years ago i have never been made to feel in any way that my race has been a handicap to me neither my pupils nor the teachers have ever shown prejudice i do not doubt that it exists i shall be in heaven long before it has all disappeared but i say it is with a colored teacher as it is with a white one her work is the only thing that counts i have never been called before the board for a reprimand in all my years of teaching the methods have changed a good deal since the time that i started in and it would be easy to lag behind but i try not to it means continual reading and study to keep up with the modern way of doing things but i manage to do it and when the time comes that i cannot do my work in a satisfactory manner i want the board of education to discharge me and get some one else in testimony to these facts one of the daily papers of detroit wrote her up in 1910 saying that she had kept her interest in modern pedagogic methods maintained a high standard of scholarship in her school and retained her sympathy with little children who had rewarded her devotion to her work with their appreciation and love to show how well she is loved by her pupils the writer was careful to state that these children as a gay group often surrounded her on her way to school clinging to her hands crowding about her as best they may all chattering and pouring out accounts of their little doings frequently says this writer she is stopped on the street by grown men and women who long ago were her pupils and who have remembered her though with the passing of the years and the new classes of little ones who come to her every term she has forgotten them11 many have been accustomed to bring their children to the everett school and speak of how glad they will be when these little ones will be under the care of their parents former teacher miss richards estimates that in the years of school work she has had in her room an average of fifty pupils a term although sometimes the attendance overflowed to a much greater number with eightyeight terms of teaching to her credit the number of pupils who owe part of their education to this gentle and cultured woman amounts well up into the tens of thousands enough to populate a fairsized city we can not close this article with a better testimonial than the following letter from one of her former pupils the honorable charles t wilkins a lawyer and an influential white citizen who addressed her on the occasion of her retirement last june my dear miss richards the friendship of so long standing between your family and mine and the high esteem in which as an educator a woman and a christian you were always held by my father the late colonel william d wilkins lead me to take the liberty of writing to congratulate you upon the wellearned retirement from active work which i have just learned from the press that you contemplate after so many years well spent in faithful service to our community as a citizen and one who has always been most interested in the education of our youth i wish to add my thanks to those which are felt if not expressed by the many who know of your devotion to and success in leading the young in the way in which they should go though your active participation in this work is about to cease may you long be spared as an example to those who follow you is the earnest hope of yours very sincerely and respectfully signed charles t wilkins w

and 175 in 1783 detroit had a colored population of 15 in 1805 and two years later a number had sufficiently increased for governor hull to organize a company of militia among them the increase had been due to the coming of refugees from canada the census of 1810 showed 17 slaves in detroit that of 1830 shows 32 in michigan and an enumeration subsequent to 1836 shows that all were dead or manumitted see census of the united states 5 laws of michigan 1827 6 this riot occurred on june 14 1833 thornton blackburn and his wife the alleged runaways from kentucky were lodged in jail pending the departure of a boat a crowd of colored men and women armed with clubs stones and pistols gathered in the vicinity of the jail upon the pretext of visiting blackburns wife a colored woman was admitted to the jail and by an exchange of clothing effected the escape of the prisoner who immediately crossed into canada some time thereafter the sheriff attempted to take his other prisoner to the boat but was knocked down and badly beaten during the encounter the sheriff fired into the mob but blackburn was rescued and carried to canada this caused a great disturbance among the white people they armed themselves and attacked the blacks wherever they could be found the city council convened and undertook to dispose of the trouble by enforcing the law of 1827 requiring that colored people should stay off the streets at night utley byron and mccutcheon michigan as a province and state ii 347 7 five years after the organization of the detroit antislavery society henry bibb an exslave came to the city and lectured for two years under the auspices of the liberty association which was promoting the election of antislavery candidates public sentiment against slavery was becoming such that the legislature of michigan passed a law prohibiting the use of jails to detain fugitives frederick douglass and john brown found many friends of their cause in detroit of the many organized efforts made to circumvent the law and assist fugitives one society purchased land and established homes for as many as 50 families between 1850 and 1872 farmer history of detroit and michigan i chapter xlviii 8 the immediate cause of the riot in detroit was the arrest conviction and imprisonment of a colored man called william faulkner charged with committing an assault on a little girl feeling that the prisoner was guilty bands of ruffians swept through the streets and mercilessly beat colored people seven years later it was discovered that faulkner was innocent and to reimburse him for his losses and humiliation the same ruffians raised a handsome sum to set him up in business see farmers history of detroit and michigan chapter xlviii 8a a study of the directories of detroit shows that a considerable number of negroes had entered the higher pursuits of labor see especially the detroit directory for 1865 9 simmons men of mark 356 10 in 1853 judge ruffin moved with his parents from richmond to boston where he became judge of the charleston district simmons men of mark 469 11 this information was obtained from newspaper clippings in the possession of miss fannie m richards the passing tradition and the african civilization a close examination shows that what we know about the negro both of the present and the past vitally affects our opinions concerning him mens beliefs concerning things are to a large extent determined by where they live and what has been handed down to them we believe in a hell of roaring flames where in the fiercest of heat the souls of the wicked are subject to eternal burnings this idea of hell was evolved in the deserts of the arabian peninsula where heat is one of the greatest forces of nature with which man has to contend among the native tribes of northern siberia dwelling in the regions of perpetual ice and snow hell is a place filled with great chunks of ice upon which the souls of the wicked are placed and there subjected to eternal freezings this idea of hell was evolved in the regions where man is in a continual battle with the cold the beliefs of negroes concerning themselves have to a large extent been made for them the reader no doubt will be interested to know that the prevailing notions concerning the inferiority of the negro grew up to a large extent as the concomitant to negro slavery in this country the bringing of the first negroes from africa as slaves was justified on the grounds that they were heathen it was not right it was argued for christians to enslave christians but they could enslave heathen who as a result would have an opportunity to become christians these negro slaves did actually become christians and as a result the colonists were forced to find other grounds to justify their continuation of the system the next argument was that they were different from white people here we have a large part of the beginnings of the doctrine of the inferiority of the negro when about 1830 antislavery agitation arose in this country a new set of arguments were brought forward to justify slavery first in importance were those taken from the bible science also was called upon and brought forward a large number of facts to demonstrate that by nature the negro was especially fitted to be a slave it happened that about this time anthropology was being developed racial differences were some of the things which especially interested scientists in this field the races were defined according to certain physical characteristics these it was asserted determined the superiority or inferiority of races the true negro race said the early anthropologists had characteristics which especially indicated its inferiority through our geographies histories and encyclopedias we have become familiar with representations of this socalled true negro whose chief characteristics were a black skin woolly hair protuberant lips and a receding forehead caricaturists seized upon these characteristics and popularized them in cartoons in songs and in other ways thus it happened that the negro through the descriptions that he got of himself has come largely to believe in his inherent inferiority and that to attain superiority he must become like the white man in color in achievements and in fact along all lines in recent years it has been asked why cannot the negro attain superiority along lines of his own that is instead of simply patterning after what the white man has done why cannot the negro through music art history and science make his own special contributions to the progress of the world this question has arisen because in the fields of science and history there have been brought forward a number of facts which prove this possibility first of all the leading scientists in the field of anthropology are telling us that while there are differences of races there are no characteristics which per se indicate that one race is inferior or superior to another the existing differences are differences in kind not in value on the other hand whatever superiority one race has attained over another has been largely due to environment a german writer in a discussion of the origin of african civilizations said some time ago what bold investigators great pioneers still find to tell us in civilizations nearer home proves more and more clearly that we are ignorant of hoary africa somewhat of its present perhaps we know but of its past little open an illustrated geography and compare the type of the african negro the bluishblack fellow of the protuberant lips the flattened nose the stupid expression and the short curly hair with the tall bronze figures from dark africa with which we have of late become familiar their almost finecut features slightly arched nose long hair etc and you have an example of the problems pressing for solution in other respects too the genuine african of the interior bears no resemblance to the accepted negro type as it figures on drug and cigar store signs wearing a shabby stovepipe hat plaid trousers and a varicolored coat a stroll through the corridors of the berlin museum of ethnology teaches that the real african need by no means resort to the rags and tatters of bygone european splendor he has precious ornaments of his own of ivory and plumes fine plaited willow ware weapons of superior workmanship justly can it be demanded what sort of civilization is this whence does it come it is also pointed out that one of the most important contributions to the civilization of mankind was very probably made by the negro race this was the invention of the smelting of iron the facts brought forward to support this view are that no iron was smelted in europe before 900 bc that about 3000 bc there began to appear on the egyptian monuments pictures of africans bringing iron from the south to egypt that at a time considerably later than this iron implements began to appear in asia that there is no iron ore in egypt and that in negro africa iron ore is abundant in many places it is found on top of the ground and in some parts it can be melted by simply placing a piece of ore in the fire very much as you would a potato to be roasted studies in the fields of ancient and medieval history are also showing that in the past there were in negro africa civilizations of probable indigenous origin which attained importance enough to be mentioned in the writings of the historians and poets of those periods the seat of one of the highest of these civilizations was ethiopia here the negro nation attained the greatest fame as early as 2500 years before the birth of christ the ethiopians appeared to have had a considerable civilization it was well known to the writers of the bible and is referred to therein some fortynine times in genesis we read of cush the eldest son of ham cush is the hebrew word for black and means the same as ethiopia one of the most famous sons of cush was nimrod whom the bible mentions as being a mighty hunter before the lord whereof it is said like nimrod a mighty hunter before the lord the bible refers to ethiopia as being far distant from palestine in the book of isaiah we read the land of the rustling of wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia that sendeth ambassadors by the sea the rivers of ethiopia mentioned in isaiah are the upper tributaries of the nile the atbara the blue nile and the sobat the later capital of ethiopia was meroe recent excavations have shown meroe to have been a city larger than memphis the temple of ammon where kings were crowned was one of the largest in the valley of the nile the great walls of cut stones were 15 feet thick and 30 feet high heaps of ironslag and furnaces for smelting iron were discovered and there were magnificent quays and landing places on the river side for the export of iron excavations have also shown that for 150 years egypt was a dependency of ethiopia the kings of the twentythird and twentyfourth egyptian dynasties were really governors appointed by ethiopian overlords while the twentyfifth dynasty was founded by the ethiopian king sabako in order to check assyrian aggression palestine was enabled to hold out against assyria by ethiopian help sennacheribs attempt to capture jerusalem and carry the jews into captivity was frustrated by the army of the ethiopian king taharka the nation and religion of judah were thus preserved from being absorbed in heathen lands like the lost ten tribes the negro soldiers of the sudan saved the jewish religion the old greek writers were well acquainted with ethiopia according to them in the most ancient times there existed to the south of egypt a nation and a land designated as ethiopia this was the land where the people with the sunburnt faces dwelt the greek poet homer mentions the ethiopians as dwelling at the uttermost limits of the earth where they enjoyed personal intercourse with the gods in one place homer said that neptune the god of the sea had gone to feast with the ethiopians who dwell afar off the ethiopians who are divided into two parts the most distant of men some at the setting of the sun others at the rising herodotus the greek historian described the ethiopians as long lived and their country as extending to the southern sea the great fame of the ethiopians is thus sketched by the eminent historian heeren who in his historical researches says in the earliest traditions of nearly all the more civilized nations of antiquity the name of this distant people is found the annals of the egyptian priests were full of them the nations of inner asia on the euphrates and tigris have interwoven the fictions of the ethiopians with their own traditions of the conquests and wars of their heroes and at a period equally remote they glimmer in greek mythology when the greeks scarcely knew italy and sicily by name the ethiopians were celebrated in the verses of their poets they spoke of them as the remotest nation the most just of men the favorites of the gods the lofty inhabitants of olympus journey to them and take part in their feasts their sacrifices are the most agreeable of all that mortals can offer them and when the faint gleam of tradition and fable gives way to the clear light of history the luster of the ethiopians is not diminished they still continue the object of curiosity and admiration and the pens of cautious clearsighted historians often place them in the highest rank of knowledge and civilization of these facts most modern historians know but little and negroes in general almost nothing for example how many have ever heard of albekri the arab writer who in the eleventh century wrote a description of the western sudan of such importance that it gained him the title of the historian of negro land how much by means of research might be learned of the town of ghana situate on the banks of the niger which the historian albekri described as a meeting place for commercial caravans from all parts of the world this town he said contained schools and centers of learning it was the resort of the learned the rich and the pious of all nations likewise most of us have never heard perhaps of another arab writer iben khaldun who in writing about the middle of the fourteenth century of melle another of the kingdoms of the sudan reported that caravans from egypt consisting of twelve thousand laden camels passed every year through one town on the eastern border of the empire on their way to the capital of the nation the load of a camel was three hundred pounds 12000 camel loads amounted therefore to something like 1600 tons of merchandise at this time we are told that there was probably not a ship in any of the merchant navies of the world which could carry one hundred tons 250 years later the average tonnage of the vessels of spain was 300 tons and that of the english much less the largest ship which queen elizabeth had in her navy the great mary had a capacity of a thousand tons but it was considered an exception and the marvel of the age another thing that is not generally known is the importance to which some of these negro kingdoms of the western sudan attained during the middle ages and the first centuries of the modern era in size and permanency they compared favorably with the most advanced nations of europe the kingdom of melle of which the historian iben khaldun wrote had an area of over 1000 miles in extent and existed for 250 years it was the first of the kingdoms of the western sudan to be received on equal terms with the contemporary white nations the greatest of all the sudan states was the kingdom of songhay which in its golden age had an area almost equal to that of the united states and existed from about 750 ad to 1591 there is a record of the kings of songhay in regular succession for almost 900 years the length of the life of the songhay empire coincides almost exactly with the life of rome from its foundation as a republic to its downfall as an empire the greatest evidences of the high state of civilization which the sudan had in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries were the attention that was paid to education and the unusual amount of learning that existed there the university of sankore at timbuctu was a very active center of learning it was in correspondence with the universities of north africa and egypt it was in touch with the universities of spain in the sixteenth century timbuctu had a large learned class living at ease and busily occupied with the elucidation of intellectual and religious problems the town swarmed with students law literature grammar theology and the natural sciences were studied the city of melle had a regular school of science one distinguished geographer is mentioned and allusions to surgical science show that the old maxim of the arabian schools he who studies anatomy pleases god was not forgotten one of these writers mentions that his brother came from jenne to timbuctu to undergo an operation for cataract of the eyes at the hands of a celebrated surgeon there it is said that the operation was wholly successful the appearance of comets so amazing to europe of the middle ages and at the present time to the ignorant was by these learned blacks noted calmly as a matter of scientific interest earthquakes and eclipses excited no great surprise the renowned writer of the sudan was abdurrahman essadi he was born in timbuctu in 1596 he came of learned and distinguished ancestors he is chief author of the history of sudan the book is said to be a wonderful document the narrative deals mainly with the modern history of the songhay empire and relates the rise of this black civilization through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and its decadence up to the middle of the seventeenth century the noted traveller barth was of the opinion that the book forms one of the most important additions that the present age has made to the history of mankind the work is especially valuable for the unconscious light which it throws upon the life manners politics and literature of the country it presents a vivid picture of the character of the men with whom it deals it is sometimes called the epic of the sudan from this brief sketch which i have given of the african in ancient and medieval times it is clear that negroes should not despise the rock from which they were hewn as a race they have a past which is full of interest it is worthy of serious study from it we can draw inspiration for it appears that not all black men everywhere throughout the ages have been hewers of wood and drawers of water on the contrary through long periods of time there were powerful black nations which have left the records of their achievements and of which we are just now beginning to learn a little this little however which we have learned teaches us that the negroes of today should work and strive along their own special line and in their own peculiar way they should endeavor to make contributions to civilization their achievements can be such that once more black will be dignified and the fame of ethiopia again spread throughout the world monroe n work the mind of the african negro as reflected in his proverbs as a study of folk literature of different races offers one way of understanding their mental attitude toward life and its problems the folk literature of the negro will reveal to us his inherent moral and intellectual bias and the natural trend of his philosophy let us therefore examine some phases of this subject paying particular attention to that part which relates especially to the proverbs the sources of such literature are abundant a little research in a wellequipped library brings one into a curious and informing mass of knowledge ever increasing in bulk in the french german and english languages as well as in many strange and highly inflected african tongues a cursory reading of this literature discloses at once that our general knowledge of africa has been based in the past mainly on those external facts that strike the sense of sight such as the physical appearance of the population native dress and handiwork musical instruments implements of warfare and customs peculiar to the social and religious life of the people only through the folk literature however can we get a glimpse of the working of the mind of the african negro professor henry drummond although he had traveled in africa and had written at length about it still exhibited a longing for this insight when he observed i have often wished that i could get inside of an african for an afternoon and just see how he looked at things at that time much of the folk literature of that continent was not as now available a deeper and more extensive reading of it at present strengthens our belief in the ancient saying out of africa there is always something new a rather disquieting thought if we have reached the conclusion that native culture on that continent has never risen above the zero point a critical examination of the content of this folk literature will result in a division somewhat similar to that found in the same type of literature of other races such a division discloses stories poetry riddles and proverbs the african folk literature is especially rich in proverbs so numerous are these proverbs that it has been said that there is scarcely an object presented to the eye scarcely an idea excited in the mind but it is accompanied by some sententious aphorism founded on close observation of man and animals and in many cases of a decidedly moral tendency lord bacon remarked many years ago that the genius wit and spirit of a nation are discovered in its proverbs cervantes in don quixote says methinks sancho that there is no proverb that is not true because they are all judgments drawn from the same experience which is the mother of all knowledge if these sayings be true then the proverbs of the african negro should be examined in order to see if they approach these observations for convenience of the reader an effort has been made to arrange these sententious sayings under general subjects these selected by no means exhaust the mine of african proverbial lore but are only a few nuggets that suggest the negros power to infer and generalize and to express himself in a graphic and concise way relative to life as he observed and experienced it1 anger anger does nobody good but patience is

negro slavery1 no 1 amidst the infinite variety of moral and political subjects proper for public commendation it is truly surprising that one of the most important and affecting should be so generally neglected an encroachment on the smallest civil or political privilege shall fan the enthusiastic flames of liberty till it shall extend over vast and distant regions and violently agitate a whole continent but the cause of humanity shall be basely violated justice shall be wounded to the heart and national honor deeply and lastingly polluted and not a breath or murmur shall arise to disturb the prevailing quiescence or to rouse the feelings of indignation against such general extensive and complicated iniquityto what cause are we to impute this frigid silencethis torpid indifferencethis cold inanimated conduct of the otherwise warm and generous americans why do they remain inactive amidst the groans of injured humanity the shrill and distressing complaints of expiring justice and the keen remorse of polluted integritywhy do they not rise up to assert the cause of god and the world to drive the fiend injustice into remote and distant regions and to exterminate oppression from the face of the fair fields of america when the united colonies revolted from great britain they did it upon this principle that all men are by nature and of right ought to be freeafter a long successful and glorious struggle for liberty during which they manifested the firmest attachment to the rights of mankind can they so soon forget the principles that then governed their determinations can americans after the noble contempt they expressed for tyrants meanly descend to take up the scourge blush ye revolted colonies for having apostatized from your own principles slavery in whatever point of light it is considered is repugnant to the feelings of nature and inconsistent with the original rights of man it ought therefore to be stigmatized for being unnatural and detested for being unjust tis an outrage to providence and an affront offered to divine majesty who has given to man his own peculiar imagethat the americans after considering the subject in this lightafter making the most manly of all possible exertions in defence of libertyafter publishing to the world the principle upon which they contended viz that all men are by nature and of right ought to be free should still retain in subjection a numerous tribe of the human race merely for their own private use and emolument is of all things the strongest inconsistency the deepest reflexion on our conduct and the most abandoned apostasy that ever took place since the almighty fiat spoke into existence this habitable world so flagitous a violation can never escape the notice of a just creator whose vengeance may be now on the wing to disseminate and hurl the arrows of destruction in what light can the people of europe consider america after the strange inconsistency of her conduct will they not consider her as an abandoned and deceitful country in the hour of calamity she petitioned heaven to be propitious to her cause her prayers were heard heaven pitied her distress smiled on her virtuous exertions and vanquished all her afflictions the ungrateful creature forgets this timely assistanceno longer remembers her own sorrowsbut basely commences oppression in her turnbeware america pauseand consider the difference between the mild effulgence of approving providence and the angry countenance of incensed divinity the importation of slaves into america ought to be a subject of the deepest regret to every benevolent and thinking mindand one of the greatest defects in the federal system is the liberty it allows on this head venerable in every thing else it is injudicious here and it is to be much deplored that a system of so much political perfection should be stained with any thing that does an outrage to human nature as a door however is open to amendment for the sake of distressed humanity of injured national reputation and the glory of doing so benevolent a thing i hope some wise and virtuous patriot will advocate the measure and introduce an alteration in that pernicious part of the governmentso far from encouraging the importation of slaves and countenancing that vile traffic in human flesh the members of the late continental convention2 should have seized the happy opportunity of prohibiting for ever this cruel species of reprobated villainythat they did not do so will for ever diminish the luster of their other proceedings so highly extolled and so justly distinguished for their intrinsic value let us for a moment contrast the sentiments and actions of the europeans on this subject with those of our own countrymen in france the warmest and most animated exertions are making in order to introduce the entire abolition of the slave trade and in england many of the first characters of the country advocate the same measure with an enthusiastic philanthropy the prime minister himself is at the head of that society and nothing can equal the ardour of their endeavours but the glorious goodness of the cause3will the americans allow the people of england to get the start of them in acts of humanity forbid it shame the practice of stealing or bartering for human flesh is pregnant with the most glaring turpitude and the blackest barbarity of dispositionfor can any one say that this is doing as he would be done by will such a practice stand the scrutiny of this great rule of moral government who can without the complicated emotions of anger and impatience suppose himself in the predicament of a slave who can bear the thoughts of his relatives being torn from him by a savage enemy carried to distant regions of the habitable globe never more to return and treated there as the unhappy africans are in this country who can support the reflexion of his fatherhis motherhis sisteror his wifeperhaps his childrenbeing barbarously snatched away by a foreign invader without the prospect of ever beholding them again who can reflect upon their being afterwards publicly exposed to saleobliged to labor with unwearied assiduityand because all things are not possible to be performed by persons so unaccustomed to robust exercise scourged with all the rage and anger of malignity until their unhappy carcasses are covered with ghastly wounds and frightful contusions who can reflect on these things when applying the case to himself without being chilled with horror at circumstances so extremely shockingyet hideous as this concise and imperfect description is of the sufferings sustained by many of our slaves it is nevertheless true and so far from being exaggerated falls infinitely short of a thousand circumstances of distress which have been recounted by different writers on the subject and which contribute to make their situation in this life the most absolutely wretched and completely miserable that can possibly be conceivedin many places in america the slaves are treated with every circumstance of rigorous inhumanity accumulated hardship and enormous crueltyyet when we take them from africa we deprive them of a country which god hath given them for their own as free as we are and as capable of enjoying that blessing like pirates we go to commit devastation on the coast of an innocent country and among a people who never did us wrong an insatiable avaricious desire to accumulate riches cooperating with a spirit of luxury and injustice seems to be the leading cause of this peculiarly degrading and ignominious practice being once accustomed to subsist without labour we become soft and voluptuous and rather than afterwards forego the gratification of our habitual indolence and ease we countenance the infamous violation and sacrifice at the shrine of cruelty all the finer feelings of elevated humanity considering things in this view there surely can be nothing more justly reprehensible or disgusting than the extravagant finery of many country peoples daughters it hath not been at all uncommon to observe as much gauze lace and other trappings on one of those country maidens as hath employed two or three of her fathers slaves for twelve months afterwards to raise tobacco to pay for tis an ungrateful reflexion that all this frippery and effected finery can only he supported by the sweat of another persons brow and consequently only by lawful rapine and injustice if these young females could devote as much time from their amusements as would be necessary for reflexion or was there any person of humanity at hand who could inculcate the indecency of this kind of extravagance i am persuaded that they have hearts good enough to reject with disdain the momentary pleasure of making a figure in behalf of the rational and lasting delight of contributing by their forbearance to the happiness of many thousand individuals in maryland where slaves are treated with as much lenity as perhaps they are any where their situation is to the last degree ineligible they live in wretched cots that scarcely secure them from the inclemency of the weather sleep in the ashes or on straw wear the coarsest clothing and subsist on the most ordinary food that the country produces in all things they are subject to their masters absolute command and of course have no will of their own thus circumstanced they are subject to great brutality and are often treated with it in particular instances they may be better provided for in this state but this suffices for a general description but in the carolinas and the island of jamaica the cruelties that have been wantonly exercised on those miserable creatures are without a precedent in any other part of the world if those who have written on the subject may be believed it is not uncommon there to tie a slave up and whip him to death on all occasions impartiality in the distribution of justice should be observed the little state of rhode island has been reprobated by other states for refusing to enter into measures respecting a new general government and so far it is admitted that she is culpable4 but if she is worthy of blame in this respect she is entitled to the highest admiration for the philanthropy justice and humanity she hath displayed respecting the subject i am treating on she hath passed an act prohibiting the importation of slaves into that state and forbidding her citizens to engage in the iniquitous traffic so striking a proof of her strong attachment to the rights of humanity will rescue her name from oblivion and bid her live in the good opinion of distant and unborn generations slavery unquestionably should be abolished particularly in this country because it is inconsistent with the declared principles of the american revolution the sooner therefore we set about it the better either we should set our slaves at liberty immediately and colonize them in the western territory5 or we should immediately take measures for the gradual abolition of it so that it may become a known and fixed point that ultimately universal liberty in these united states shall triumphthis is the least we can do in order to evince our sense of the irreparable outrages we have committed to wipe off the odium we have incurred and to give mankind a confidence again in the justice liberality and honour of our national proceedings it would not be difficult to show were it necessary that america would soon become a richer and more happy country provided the step was adopted that corrosive anguish of persevering in anything improper which now embitters the enjoyments of life would vanish as the mist of a foggy morn doth before the rising sun and we should find as great a disparity between our present situation and that which would succeed to it as subsists between a cloudy winter and a radiant springbesides our lands would not be then cut down for the support of a numerous train of useless inhabitantsuseless i mean to themselves and effectually to us by encouraging sloth and voluptuousness among our young farmers and planters who might otherwise know how to take care of their money as well as how to dissipate itin all other respects i conceive them to be as valuable as we areas capable of worthy purposes and to possess the same dignity that we do in the estimation of providence although the value of their work apart for which we are dependent on them we generally consider them as good for nothing and accordingly treat them with greatest neglect but be it remembered that this cause is the cause of heaven and that the father of them as well as of us will not fail at a future settlement to adjust the account between us with a dreadful attention to justice othello baltimore may 10 1788 american museum iv 412415 essay on negro slavery no ii upon no better principle do we plunder the coasts of africa and bring away its wretched inhabitants as slaves than that by which the greater fish swallows up the lesser superior power seems only to produce superior brutality and that weakness and imbecility which ought to engage our protection and interest the feelings of social benevolence in behalf of the defenceless seems only to provoke us to acts of illiberal outrage and unmanly violence the practice which has been followed by the english nation since the establishment of the slave tradei mean that of stirring up the natives of africa against each other with a view of purchasing the prisoners mutually taken in battle must strike the humane mind with sentiments of the deepest abhorrence and confer on that people a reproach as lasting as time itself it is surprising that the eastern world did not unite to discourage a custom so diabolical in its tendency and to exterminate a species of oppression which humbles the dignity of all mankind but this torpid inattention can only be accounted for by adverting to the savage disposition of the times which countenanced cruelties unheard of at this enlightened period what rudeness of demeanor and brutality of manner which had been introduced into europe by those swarms of barbarians that overwhelmed it from the north had hardly begun to dissipate before the enlivening sun of civilization when this infernal practice first sprang up into existence before this distinguished era of refined barbarity the sons of africa were in possession of all the mild enjoyments of peaceall the pleasing delights of uninterrupted harmonyand all the diffusive blessings of profound tranquility boundless must be the punishment which irritated providence will inflict on those whose wanton cruelty has prompted them to destroy this fair arrangement of naturethis flowery prospect of human felicity engulphed in the dark abyss of never ending misery they shall in bitterness atone for the stab thus given to human nature and in anguish unutterable expiate crimes for which nothing less than eternal sufferings can make adequate retributionequally iniquitous is the practice of robbing that country of its inhabitants and equally tremendous will be the punishment the voice of injured thousands who have been violently torn from their native country and carried to distant and inhospitable climesthe bitter lamentations of the wretched helpless femalethe cruel agonizing sensations of the husband the father and the friendwill ascend to the throne of omnipotence and from the elevated heights of heaven cause him with the whole force of almighty vengeance to hurl the guilty perpetrators of those inhuman beings down the steep precipice of inevitable ruin into the bottomless gulph of final irretrievable and endless destruction ye sons of america forbearconsider the dire consequences that will attend the prosecution against which the allpowerful god of nature holds up his hands and loudly proclaims desist in the insolence of selfconsequence we are accustomed to esteem ourselves and the christian powers of europe the only civilized people on the globe the rest without distinction we presumptuously denominate barbarians but when the practices above mentioned come to be deliberately consideredwhen added to these we take a view of the proceedings of the english in the east indies under the direction of the late lord clive and remember what happened in the streets of bengal and calcuttawhen we likewise reflect on our american mode of driving butchering and exterminating the poor defenceless indians the native and lawful proprietors of the soilwe shall acknowledge if we possess the smallest degree of candor that the appellation of barbarian does not belong to them alone while we continue those practices the term christian will only be a burlesque expression signifying no more than that it ironically denominates the rudest sect of barbarians that ever disgraced the hand of their creator we have the precepts of the gospel for the government of our moral deportment in violation of which those outrageous wrongs are committed but they have no such meliorating influence among them and only adhere to the simple dictates of reason and natural religion which they never violate might not the inhabitants of africa with still greater justice on their side than we have on ours cross the atlantic seize our citizens carry them into africa and make slaves of them provided they were able to do it but should this be really the case every corner of the globe would reverberate with the sound of african oppression so loud would be our complaint and so feeling our appeal to the inhabitants of the world at large we should represent them as a lawless piratical set of unprincipled robbers plunderers and villains who basely prostituted the superior power and information which god had given them for worthy purposes to the vilest of all ends we should not hesitate to say that they made use of those advantages only to infringe upon every dictate of justice to trample under foot every suggestion of principle and to spurn with contempt every right of humanity the algerines are reprobated all the world over for their unlawful depredations and stigmatized as pirates for their unreasonable exactions from foreign nations but the algerines are no greater pirates than the americans nor are they a race more destructive to the happiness to mankind the depredations of the latter on the coast of africa and upon the indians territory make the truth of this assertion manifest the piratical depredations of the algerines appear to be a judgment from heaven upon the nations to punish their perfidy and atrocious violations of justice and never did any people more justly merit the scourge than americans on whom it seems to fall with peculiar and reiterated violence when they yoke our citizens to the plow and compel them to labour in that degraded manner they only retaliate on us for similar barbarities for algiers is a part of the same country whose helpless inhabitants we are accustomed to carry away but the english and americans cautiously avoid engaging with a warlike people whom they fear to attack in a manner so base and unworthy whilst the algerines more generous and courageous plunderers are not afraid to make war on brave and welldisciplined enemies who are capable of making a gallant resistance whoever examines into the conditions of the slaves in america will find them in a state of the most uncultivated rudeness not instructed in any kind of learning they are grossly ignorant of all refinement and have little else about them belonging to the nature of civilized man than mere form they are strangers to almost every idea that doth not relate to their labour or their food and though naturally possessed of strong sagacity and lively parts are in all respects in a state of most deplorable brutalitythis is owing to the ironhand of oppression which ever crushes the bud of genius and binds up in chains every expansion of the human mindsuch is their extreme ignorance that they are utterly unacquainted with the laws of the worldthe injunctions of religiontheir own natural rights and the forms ceremonies and privileges of marriage originally established by the divinity accordingly they lived in open violation of the precepts of christianity and with as little formality or restrictions as the brutes of the field unite for the purposes of procreation yet this is a civilized country and a most enlightened period of the world the resplendent glory of the gospel is at hand to conduct us in safety through the labyrinths of life science hath grown up to maturity and is discovered to possess not only all the properties of solidity of strength but likewise every ornament of elegance and every embellishment of fancy philosophy hath here attained the most exalted height of elevation and the art of government hath received such refinements among us as hath equally astonished our friends our enemies and ourselves in fine no annals are more brilliant than those of america nor do any more luxuriantly abound with examples of exalted heroism refined policy and sympathetic humanity yet now the prospect begins to change and all the splendor of this august assemblage will soon be overcast by sudden and impenetrable clouds and american greatness be obliterated and swallowed up by one enormity slavery diffuses the gloom and casts around us the deepest shade of approaching darkness no longer shall the united states of america be famed for liberty oppression pervades their bowels and while they exhibit a fair exterior to the other parts of the world they are nothing more than painted sepulchres containing within them nought but rottenness and corruption ye voluptuous ye opulent and great who hold in subjection such numbers of your fellowcreatures and suffer these things to happenbeware reflect on this lamentable change that may at a future period take place against you arraigned before the almighty sovereign of the universe how will you answer the charge of such complicated enormity the presence of these slaves who have been lost for want of your instruction and by means of your oppression shall make you dart deeper into the flames to avoid their just reproaches and seek out for an asylum in the hidden corners of perdition many persons of opulence in virginia and the carolinas treat their unhappy slaves with every circumstance of coolest neglect and the most deliberate indifference surrounded with a numerous train of servants to contribute to their personal ease and wallowing in all the luxurious plenitude of riches they neglect the wretched source whence they draw this profusion many of their negroes on distant estates are left to the entire management of inhuman overseers where they suffer for the want of that sustenance which at the proprietors seat of residence is wastefully given to the dogs it frequently happens on these large estates that they are not clothed till winter is nearly expired and then the most valuable only are attended to the young and the labourworn having no other allowance in this respect than the tattered garments thrown off by the more fortunate a single peck of corn a week or the like measure of rice is the ordinary quantity of provision for a hard working slave to which a small quantity of meat is occasionally tho rarely added while those miserable degraded persons thus scantily subsist all the produce of their unwearied toil is taken away to satiate their rapacious master he devoted wretch thoughtless of the sweat and toil with which his wearied exhausted dependents procure what he extravagantly dissipates not contented with the ordinary luxuries of life is perhaps planning at the time some improvement on the voluptuous artthus he sets up two carriages instead of one maintains twenty servants when a fourth part of that number are more than sufficient to discharge the business of personal attendance makes every animal proper for the purpose bleed around him in order to supply the gluttonous profusion of his table and generally gives away what his slaves are pining forthose very slaves whose labour enables him to display this liberalityno comment is necessary to expose the peculiar folly ingratitude and infamy of such execrable conduct but the custom of neglecting those slaves who have been worn out in our service is unhappily found to prevail not only among the more opulent but thro the more extensive round of the middle and inferior ranks of life no better reason can be given for this base inattention than that they are no longer able to contribute to our emoluments with singular dishonor we forget the faithful instrument of past enjoyment and when by length of time it becomes debilitated it is like a withered stalk ungratefully thrown away our slaves unquestionably have the strongest of all claims upon us for protection and support we having compelled them to involuntary servitude and deprived them of every means of protecting or supporting themselves the injustice of our conduct and barbarity of our neglect when this reflexion is allowed to predominate becomes so glaringly conspicuous as even to excite against ourselves the strongest emotion of detestation and abhorrence to whom are the wretched sons of africa to apply for redress if their cruel master treats them with unkindness to whom will they resort for protection if he is base enough to refuse it to them the law is not their friendalas too many statutes are enacted against them the world is not their friendthe iniquity is too general and extensive no one who hath slaves of his own will protect those of another less the practice should be retorted thus when their masters abandon them their situation is destitute and forlorn and god is their only friend let us imitate the conduct of a neighboring state and immediately take measures at least for the gradual abolition of slavery6 justice demands it of us and we ought not to hesitate in obeying its inviolable mandatesall the feelings of pity compassion affection and benevolenceall the emotions of tenderness humanity philanthropy and goodnessall the sentiments of mercy probity honour and integrity unite to solicit for their emancipation immortal will be the glory of accomplishing their liberation and eternal the disgrace of keeping them in chains but if the state of pennsylvania is to be applauded for her conduct that of south carolina can never be too strongly execrated7 the legislature of that state at no very remote period brought in a bill for prohibiting the use of letters to their slaves and forbidding them the privilege of being taught to readthis was a deliberate attempt to enslave the minds of those unfortunate objects whose persons they already held in arbitrary subjectiondetestable deviation from the becoming rectitude of man one more peculiarly distressing circumstance remains to be

men who are distinguished from the rest of the human species by a black skin and wooly hairdisadvantages of very little moment in themselves but which prove to us a source of greatest misery because there are men who will not be persuaded that it is possible for a human soul to be lodged within a sable body the west indian planters could not if they thought us men so wantonly spill our blood nor could the natives of this land of liberty deeming us of the same species with themselves submit to be instrumental in enslaving us or think us proper subjects of a sordid commerce yet strong as the prejudices against us are it will not i hope on this side of the atlantic be considered as a crime for a poor african not to confess himself a being of an inferior order to those who happen to be of a different colour from himself or be thought very presumptuous in one who is but a negro to offer to the happy subjects of this free government some reflections upon the wretched condition of his countrymen they will not i trust think worse of my brethren for being discontented with so hard a lot as that of slavery nor disown me for their fellowcreature merely because i deeply feel the unmerited sufferings which my countrymen endure it is neither the vanity of being an author nor a sudden and capricious gust of humanity which has prompted this present design it has long been conceived and long been the principal subject of my thoughts ever since an indulgent master rewarded my youthful services with freedom and supplied me at a very early age with the means of acquiring knowledge i have laboured to understand the true principles on which the liberties of mankind are founded and to possess myself of the language of this country in order to plead the cause of those who were once my fellow slaves and if possible to make my freedom in some degree the instrument of their deliverance the first thing then which seems necessary in order to remove those prejudices which are so unjustly entertained against us is to prove that we are mena truth which is difficult of proof only because it is difficult to imagine by what argument it can be combatted can it be contended that a difference of colour alone can constitute a difference of speciesif not in what single circumstance are we different from the rest of mankind what variety is there in our organization what inferiority of art in the fashoning of our bodies what imperfection in the faculties of our mindshas not a negro eyes has not a negro hands organs dimensions senses affections passionsfed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter as a white man if you prick us do we not bleed if you poison us do we not die are we not exposed to all the same wants do we not feel all the same sentimentsare we not capable of all the same exertionsand are we not entitled to all the same rights as other men yesand it is said we are men it is true but that we are men addicted to more and worse vices than those of any other complexion and such is the innate perverseness of our minds that nature seems to have marked us out for slaverysuch is the apology perpetually made for our masters and the justification offered for that universal proscription under which we labour but i supplicate our enemies to be though for the first time just in their proceedings toward us and to establish the fact before they attempt to draw any conclusions from it nor let them imagine that this can be done by merely asserting that such is our universal character it is the character i grant that our inhuman masters have agreed to give us and which they have so industriously and too successfully propagated in order to palliate their own guilt by blackening the helpless victims of it and to disguise their own cruelty under the semblance of justice let the natural depravity of our character be provednot by appealing to declamatory invectives and interested representations but by showing that a greater proportion of crimes have been committed by the wronged slaves of the plantation than by the luxurous inhabitants of europe who are happily strangers to those aggravated provocations by which our passions are every day irritated and incensed show us that of the multitude of negroes who have within a few years transported themselves to this country8 and who are abandoned to themselves who are corrupted by example prompted by penury and instigated by the memory of their wrongs to the commission of crimeshew us i say and the demonstration if it be possible cannot be difficult that a greater proportion of these than of white men have fallen under the animadversions of justice and have been sacrificed to your laws though avarice may slander and insult our misery and though poets heighten the horror of their fables by representing us as monsters of vicethe fact is that if treated like other men and admitted to a participation of their rights we should differ from them in nothing perhaps but in our possessing stronger passions nicer sensibility and more enthusiastic virtue before so harsh a decision was pronounced upon our nature we might have expectedif sad experience had not taught us to expect nothing but injustice from our adversariesthat some pains would have been taken to ascertain what our nature is and that we should have been considered as we are found in our native woods and not as we now arealtered and perverted by an inhuman political institution but instead of this we are examined not by philosophers but by interested traders not as nature formed us but as man has depraved usand from such an inquiry prosecuted under such circumstances the perverseness of our dispositions is said to be established cruel that you are you make us slaves you implant in our minds all the vices which are in some degree inseparable from that condition and you then impiously impute to nature and to god the origin of those vices to which you alone have given birth and punish in us the crimes of which you are yourselves the authors the condition of the slave is in nothing more deplorable than in its being so unfavorable to the practice of every virtue the surest foundation of virtue is love of our fellow creatures and that affection takes its birth in the social relations of men to one another but to a slave these are all denied he never pays or receives the grateful duties of a sonhe never knows or experiences the fond solicitude of a fatherthe tender names of husband of brother and of friend are to him unknown he has no country to defend and bleed forhe can relieve no sufferingsfor he looks around in vain to find a being more wretched than himself he can indulge no generous sentimentfor he sees himself every hour treated with contempt and ridiculed and distinguished from irrational brutes by nothing but the severity of punishment would it be surprising if a slave labouring under all these disadvantagesoppressed insulted scorned trampled onshould come at last to despise himselfto believe the calumnies of his oppressorsand to persuade himself that it would be against his nature to cherish any honourable sentiment or to attempt any virtuous action before you boast of your superiority over us place some of your own colour if you have the heart to do it in the same situation with us and see whether they have such innate virtue and such unconquerable vigour of mind as to be capable of surmounting such multiplied difficulties and of keeping their minds free from the infection of every vice even under the oppressive yoke of such a servitude but not satisfied with denying us that indulgence to which the misery of our condition gives us so just a claim our enemies have laid down other and stricter rules of morality to judge our actions by than those by which the conduct of all other men is tried habits which in all human beings except ourselves are thought innocent are in us deemed criminal and actions which are even laudable in white men become enormous crimes in negroes in proportion to our weakness the strictness of censure is increased upon us and as resources are withheld from us our duties are multiplied the terror of punishment is perpetually before our eyes but we know not how to avert it what rules to act by or what guides to follow we have written laws indeed composed in a language we do not understand and never promulgated but what avail written laws when the supreme law with us is the capricious will of our overseers to obey the dictates of our own hearts and to yield to the strong propensities of nature is often to incur severe punishment and by emulating examples which we find applauded and revered among europeans we risk inflaming the wildest wrath of our inhuman tyrants to judge of the truth of these assertions consult even those milder and subordinate rules for our conduct the various codes of your west india lawsthose laws which allow us to be men whenever they consider us as victims of their vengeance but treat us only like a species of living property as often as we are to be the objects of their protectionthose laws by which it may be truly said that we are bound to suffer and be miserable under pain of death to resent an injury received from a white man though of the lowest rank and to dare to strike him though upon the strongest and grossest provocation is an enormous crime to attempt to escape from the cruelties exercised upon us by flight is punished with mutilation and sometimes with death to take arms against masters whose cruelties no submission can mitigate no patience exhaust and from whom no other means of deliverance are left is the most atrocious of all crimes and is punished by a gradual death lengthened out by torments so exquisite that none but those who have been long familiarized with west indian barbarity can hear the bare recital of them without horror and yet i learn from writers whom the europeans hold in the highest esteem that treason is a crime which cannot be committed by a slave against his master that a slave stands in no civil relation towards his master and owes him no allegiance that master and slave are in a state of war and if the slave take up arms for his deliverance he acts not only justifiably but in obedience to a natural duty the duty of selfpreservation i read in authors whom i find venerated by our oppressors that to deliver ones self and ones countrymen from tyranny is an act of the sublimest heroism i hear europeans exalted as the martyrs of public liberty the saviours of their country and the deliverers of mankindi see other memories honoured with statues and their names immortalized in poetryand yet when a generous negro is animated by the same passion which ennobled themwhen he feels the wrongs of his countrymen as deeply and attempts to avenge them as boldlyi see him treated by those same europeans as the most execrable of mankind and led out amidst curses and insults to undergo a painful gradual and ignominious death and thus the same briton who applauds his own ancestors for attempting to throw off the easy yoke imposed on them by the romans punishes us as detested parricides for seeking to get free from the cruelest of all tyrannies and yielding to the irresistible eloquence of an african galgacus or boadicea are then the reason and morality for which europeans so highly value themselves of a nature so variable and fluctuating as to change with the complexion of those to whom they are applieddo rights of nature cease to be such when a negro is to enjoy themor does patriotism in the heart of an african rankle into treason a free negro american museum v 77 et seq 1789 remarkable speech of adahoonzou king of dahomey an interior nation of africa on hearing what was passing in england respecting the slave trade i admire the reasoning of the white men but with all their sense it does not appear that they have thoroughly studied the nature of the blacks whose disposition differs as much from that of the whites as their colour the same great being formed both and since it hath seemed convenient for him to distinguish mankind by opposite complexions it is a fair conclusion to presume that there may be as a great a disagreement in the qualitie of their minds there is likewise a remarkable difference between the countries which we inhabit you englishmen for instance as i have been informed are surrounded by the ocean and by this situation seem intended to hold communication with the whole world which you do by means of your ships whilst we dahomans being placed on a large continent and hemmed in amidst a variety of other people of the same complexion but speaking different languages are obliged by the sharpness of our swords to defend ourselves from their incursions and punish the depredations they make on us such conduct in them is productive of incessant wars your countrymen therefore who alledge that we go to war for the purpose of supplying your ships with slaves are grossly mistaken you think you can work a reformation as you call it in the manners of the blacks but you ought to consider the disproportion between the magnitude of the two countries and then you will soon be convinced of the difficulties that must be surmounted to change the system of such a vast country as this we know you are a brave people and that you might bring over a great many of the blacks to your opinions by points of your bayonets but to effect this a great many must be put to death and numerous cruelties must be committed which we do not find to have been the practice of the whites besides that this would militate against the very principle which is professed by those who wish to bring about a reformation in the name of my ancestors and myself i aver that no dahoman ever embarked in war merely for the sake of procuring wherewithal to purchase your commodities i who have not been long master of this country have without thinking of the market killed many thousands and i shall kill many thousands more when policy or justice requires that men be put to death neither silk nor coral nor brandy nor cowries can be accepted as substitutes for the blood that ought to be spilt for example sake besides if white men chuse to remain at home and no longer visit this country for the same purpose that has usually brought them thither will black men cease to make war i answer by no means and if there be no ships to receive their captives what will become of them i answer for you they will be put to death perhaps you may be asked how will the blacks be punished with guns and powder i reply by another question had we not clubs and bows and arrows before we knew white men did not you see me make customannual ceremonyfor weebaigah the third king of dahomey and did you not observe on the day such ceremony was performing that i carried a bow in my hand and a quiver filled with arrows on my back these were the emblems of the times when with such weapons that brave ancestor fought and conquered all his neighbors god made war for all the world and every kingdom large or small has practiced it more or less though perhaps in a manner unlike and upon different principles did weebaigah sell slaves no his prisoners were all killed to a man what else could he have done with them was he to let them remain in this country to cut the throats of his subjects this would have been wretched policy indeed which had it been adopted the dahoman name would have long ago been extinguished instead of becoming as it is at this day the terror of surrounding nations what hurts me most is that some of your people have maliciously misrepresented us in books which never die alledging that we sell our wives and children for the sake of procuring a few kegs of brandy no we are shamefully belied and i hope you will contradict from my mouth the scandalous stories that have been propagated and tell posterity that we have been abused we do indeed sell to the white men a part of our prisoners and we have a right to do so are not all prisoners at the disposal of their captors and are we to blame if we send delinquents to a far country i have been told you do the same if you want no more slaves from us why cannot you be ingenious and tell the plain truth saying that the slaves you have already purchased are sufficient for the country for which you bought them or that the artists who used to make fine things are all dead without having taught anybody to make more but for a parcel of men with long heads to sit down in england and frame laws for us and pretend to dictate how we are to live of whom they know nothing never having been in a black mans country during the whole course of their lives is to me somewhat extraordinary no doubt they must have been biased by the report of some one who had had to do with us who for want of a due knowledge of the treatment of slaves found that they died on his hands and that his money was lost and seeing that others thrived by the traffic he envious of their good luck has vilified both black and white traders you have seen me kill many men at the customs and you have often observed delinquents at grigwhee and others of my provinces tied and sent up to me i kill them but do i ever insist on being paid for them some heads i order to be placed at my door others to be strewed about the market place that the people may stumble upon them when they little expect such a sight this gives a grandeur to my customs far beyond the display of fine things which i buy this makes my enemies fear me and gives me such a name in the bush9 besides if i neglect this indispensable duty would my ancestors suffer me to live would they not trouble me day and night and say that i sent no body to serve them that i was only solicitous about my own name and forgetful of my ancestors white men are not acquainted with these circumstances but i now tell you that you may hear and know and inform your countrymen why customs are made and will be made as long as black men continue to possess their country the few that can be spared from this necessary celebration we sell to the white men and happy no doubt are such when they find themselves on the grigwhee to be disposed of to the europeans we shall still drink water say they to themselves white men will not kill us and we may even avoid punishment by serving our new masters with fidelity the new york weekly magazine ii 430 1792 footnotes 1 othello the author of these two essays was identified as a negro by abb gregoire in his de la litterature des ngres 2 the writer refers here to the convention of 1787 which framed the constitution of the united states 3 here the writer has in mind the organization of the english society for the abolition of the slave trade and the support given the cause by wilberforce pitt fox and burke in england and by brissot clavire and montmorin in france 4 rhode island had failed to ratify the constitution of the united states 5 during the first forty years of the republic there was much talk about colonizing the negroes in the west 6 the writer refers here to the acts of pennsylvania providing for the abolition of slavery 7 in 1740 south carolina enacted a law prohibiting any one from teaching a slave to read or employing one in any manner of writing georgia enacted the same law in 1770 8 this letter was originally published in england where the number of negroes had considerably increased after the war in america 9 the country expression for the woods was bush letters showing the rise and progress of the early negro churches of georgia and the west indies1 an account of several baptist churches consisting chiefly of negro slaves particularly of one at kingston in jamaica and another at savannah in georgia a letter from the late rev mr joseph cook of the euhaw upper indian land south carolina bearing date sept 15 1790 a poor negro commonly called among his own friends brother george has been so highly favoured of god as to plant the first baptist church in savannah and another in jamaica this account produced an earnest desire to know the circumstances of both these societies hence letters were written to the rev mr cook at the euhaw to mr jonathan clarke at savannah to mr wesleys people at kingston with a view to obtain information in which particular regard was had to the character of this poor but successful minister of christ satisfactory accounts have been received from each of these quarters and a letter from brother george himself containing an answer to more than fifty questions proposed in a letter to him we presume to give an epitome of the whole to our friends hoping that they will have the goodness to let a plain unlettered people convey their ideas in their own simple way brother georges words are distinguished by inverted commas and what is not so marked is either matter compressed or information received from such persons to whom application has been made of it george liele called also george sharp because his owners name was sharp in a letter dated kingston dec 18 1791 says i was born in virginia my fathers name was liele and my mothers name nancy i can not ascertain much of them as i went to several parts of america when young and at length resided in new georgia but was informed both by white and black people that my father was the only black person who knew the lord in a spiritual way in that country i always had a natural fear of god from my youth and was often checked in conscience with thoughts of death which barred me from many sins and bad company i knew no other way at that time to hope for salvation but only in the performance of my good works about two years before the late war the rev mr matthew moore2 one sabbath afternoon as i stood with curiosity to hear him he unfolded all my dark views opened my best behaviour and good works to me which i thought i was to be saved by and i was convinced that i was not in the way to heaven but in the way to hell this state i laboured under for the space of five or six months the more i heard or read the more i saw that i was condemned as a sinner before god till at length i was brought to perceive that my life hung by a slender thread and if it was the will of god to cut me off at that time i was sure i should be found in hell as sure as god was in heaven i saw my condemnation in my own heart and i found no way wherein i could escape the damnation of hell only through the merits of my dying lord and saviour jesus christ which caused me to make intercession with christ for the salvation of my poor immortal soul and i full well recollect i requested of my lord and master to give me a work i did not care how mean it was only to try and see how good i would do it when he became acquainted with the method of salvation by our lord jesus christ he soon found relief particularly at a time when he was earnestly engaged in prayer yea he says i felt such love and joy as my tongue was not able to express after this i declared before the congregation of believers the work which god had done for my soul and the same minister the rev matthew moore baptized me and i continued in this church about four years till the vacuation of savannah by the british when mr liele was called by grace himself he was desirous of promoting the felicity of others one who was an eyewitness of it says that he began to discover his love to other negroes on the same plantation with himself by reading hymns among them encouraging them to sing and sometimes by explaining the most striking parts of them his own account is this desiring to prove the sense i had of my obligations to god i endeavoured to instruct the people of my own color in the word of god the white brethren seeing my endeavours and that the word of the lord seemed to be blessed gave me a call at a quarterly meeting to preach before the congregation afterwards mr moore took the sense of the church concerning brother lieles abilities when it appeared to be their unanimous opinion that he was possessed of ministerial gifts and according to the custom which obtains in some of the american churches he was licensed as a probationer he now exercised at different plantations especially on those lords day evenings when there was no service performed in the church to which he belonged and preached about three years at brunton land and at yamacraw which last place is about half a mile from savannah mr henry sharp his master being a deacon of the church which called george liele to the work of the ministry some years before his death gave him his freedom only he continued in the family till his masters exit mr sharp in the time of the war was an officer and was at last killed in the kings service by a ball which shot off his hand the author of this account handled the bloody glove which he wore when he received the fatal wound some persons were at this time dissatisfied with georges liberation and threw him into prison but by producing the proper papers he was released his particular friend in this business was colonel kirkland at the vacuation of the country i was partly obliged to come to jamaica as an indented servant for money i owed him he promising to be my friend in this country i was landed at kingston and by the colonels recommendation to general campbell the governor of the island i was employed by him two years and on leaving the island he gave me a written certificate from under his own hand of my good behaviour as soon as i had settled col kirklands demands on me i had a certificate of my freedom from the vestry and governor according to the act of this island both for myself and family governor campbell left the island i began about september 1784 to preach in kingston in a small private house to a good smart congregation and i formed the church with four brethren from america besides myself and the preaching took very good effect with the poorer sort especially the slaves the people at first persecuted us both at meetings and baptisms but god be praised they seldom interrupt us now we have applied to the honourable house of assembly with a petition of our distresses being poor people desiring to worship almighty god according to the tenets of the bible and they have granted us liberty and given us their sanction thanks be to god we have liberty to worship him as we please in the kingdom you ask about those who in a judgment of charity have been converted to christ i think they are about four hundred and fifty i have baptized four hundred in jamaica at kingston i baptize in the sea at spanish town in the river and at convenient places in the country we have nigh three hundred and fifty members a few white people among them one white brother of the first battalion of royals from england baptized by rev thomas davis several members have been dismissed to other churches and twelve have died i have sent enclosed an account of the conversion and death of some a few of mr wesleys people after immersion join us and continue with us we have together with well wishers and followers in different parts of the country about fifteen hundred people we receive none into the church without a few lines from their owners of their good behaviour towards them and religion the creoles of the country after they are converted and baptized as god enables them prove very faithful i have deacons and elders a few and teachers of small congregations in the town and country where convenience suits them to come together and i am pastor i preach twice on the lords day in the forenoon and afternoon and twice in the week and have not been absent six sabbath days since i formed the church in this country i receive nothing for my services i preach baptize administer the lords supper and travel from one place to another to publish the gospel and to settle church affairs all freely i have one of the chosen men whom i baptized a deacon of the church and a native of this country who keeps the regulations of church matters and i promoted a free school for the instruction of the children both free and slaves and he is the schoolmaster i cannot justly tell what is my age as i have no account of the time of my birth but i suppose i am about forty years old i have a wife and four children my wife was baptized by me in savannah at brunton land and i have every satisfaction in life from her she is much the same age as myself my eldest son is nineteen years my next son seventeen the third fourteen and the last child a girl of eleven years they are all members of the church my occupation is a farmer but as the seasons in this part of the country are uncertain i also keep a team of horses and waggons for the carrying goods from one place to another which i attend to myself with the assistance of my sons and by this way of life have gained the good will of the public who recommend me to business and to some very principal work for government i have a few books some good old authors and sermons and one large bible that was given to me by a gentleman a good many of our members can read and are all desirous to learn they will be very thankful for a few books to read on sundays and other days the last accounts i had from savannah were that the gospel had taken very great effect both there and in south carolina brother andrew bryan a black minister at savannah has two hundred members in full fellowship and had certificates from their owners of one hundred more who had given in their experiences and were ready to be baptized also i received accounts from nova scotia of a black baptist preacher brother david george who was a member of the church at savannah he had the permission of the governor to preach in three provinces his members in full communion were then sixty white and black the gospel spreading brother amos is at providence he writes me that the gospel has taken good effect and is spreading greatly he has about three hundred members brother jessy gaulsing another black minister preaches near augusta in south carolina at a place where i used to preach he was a member of the church at savannah and has sixty members and a great work is going on there i agree to election redemption the fall of adam regeneration and perseverance knowing the promise is to all who endure in grace faith and good works to the end shall be saved there is no baptist church in this country but ours we have purchased a piece of land at the east end of kingston containing three acres for the sum of 155 l3 currency and on it have begun a meetinghouse fiftyseven feet in length by thirtyseven in breadth we have raised the brick wall eight feet high from the foundation and intend to have a gallery several gentlemen members of the house of assembly and other gentlemen have subscribed towards the building about 40 l the chief part of our congregation are slaves and their owners allow them in common but three or four bits per week4 for allowance to feed themselves and out of so small a sum we cannot expect any thing that can be of service from them if we did it would soon bring a scandal upon religion and the free people in our society are but poor but they are all willing both free and slaves to do what they can as for my part i am too much entangled with the affairs of the world to go on as i would with my design in supporting the cause this has i acknowledge been a great hindrance to the gospel in one way but as i have endeavored to set a good example of industry before the inhabitants of the land it has given general satisfaction another way and rev sir we think the lord has put it in the power of the baptist societies in england to help and assist us in completing this building which we look upon will be the greatest undertaking ever was in this country for the bringing of souls from darkness into the light of the gospel and as the lord has put it into your heart to enquire after us we place all our confidence in you to make our circumstances known to the several baptist churches in england and we look upon you as our father friend and brother within the brick wall we have a shelter in which we worship until our building can be accomplished your letter was read to the church two or three times and did create a great deal of love and warmness throughout the whole congregation who shouted for joy and comfort to think that the lord had been so gracious as to satisfy us in this country with the very same religion with our beloved brethren in the old country according to the scriptures and that such a worthy of london should write in so loving a manner to such poor worms as we are and i beg leave to say that the whole congregation sang out that they would through the assistance of god remember you in their prayers they altogether give their christian love to you and all the worthy professors of jesus christ in your church at london and beg the prayers of your congregation and the prayers of the churches in general wherever it pleases you to make known our circumstances i remain with the utmost love rev sir your unworthy fellowlabourer servant and brother in christ signed george liele ps we have chosen twelve trustees all of whom are members of our church whose names are specified in the title the title proved and recorded in the secretarys office of this island i would have answered your letter much sooner but am encumbered with business the whole island under arms several of our members and a deacon were obliged to be on duty and i being trumpeter to the troop of horse in kingston am frequently called upon and also by order of government i was employed in carrying all the cannon that could be found lying about this part of the country this occasioned my long delay which i beg you will excuse baptist annual register 17903 pages 332337 to the rev mr john rippon kingston in jamaica nov 26 1791 reverend sir the perusal of your letter of the 15th july last gave me much pleasureto find that you had interested yourself to serve the glorious cause mr liele is engaged in he has been for a considerable time past very zealous in the ministry but his congregation being chiefly slaves they had it not in their power to support him therefore he has been obliged to do it from his own industry this has taken a considerable part of his time and much of his attention from his labours in the ministry however i am led to believe that it has been of essential service to the cause of god for his industry has set a good example to his flock and has put it out of the power of enemies to religion to say that he has been eating the bread of idleness or lived upon the poor slaves the idea that too much prevails here amongst the masters of slaves is that if their minds are considerably enlightened by religion or otherwise that it would be attended with the most dangerous consequences and this has been the only cause why the methodist ministers and mr liele have not made a greater progress in the ministry amongst the slaves alas how much is it to be lamented that a full quarter of a million of poor souls should so long remain in a state of nature and that masters should be so blind to their own interest as not to know the difference between obedience inforced by the lash of the whip and that which flows from religious principles although i much admire the general doctrine preached in the methodist church yet i by no means approve of their discipline set up by mr wesley that reverend man of god i very early saw into the impropriety of admitting slaves into their societies without permission of their owners and told them the consequences that would attend it but they rejected my advice and it has not only prevented the increase of their church but has raised them many enemies mr liele has very wisely acted a different part he has i believe admitted no slaves into society but those who had obtained permission from their owners by which he has made many friends and i think the almighty is now opening a way for another church in the capital where the methodists could not gain any ground a short time will determine it of which i shall advise youi really have not time to enter so fully on this subject as i wish being very much engaged in my own temporal affairs and at present having no clerkthe love i bear to the cause of god and the desire i have of being any ways instrumental to the establishing of it in this land of darkness has led me to write this but before i conclude i have some very interesting particulars to lay before youmr liele has by the aid of the congregation and the assistance of some few people raised the walls of a church ready to receive the roof but has not the means to lay it on and finish it nor do i see any prospect of its going further without he receives the aid of some religious institution from home one hundred and fifty pounds i think would complete it and if this sum could be raised it would greatly serve the cause of god and might be the means of bringing many hundred souls who are now in a state of darkness to the knowledge of our great redeemer if this could be raised the sooner the better our family contributed towards the purchase of the methodist chapel nor shall our mite be wanting to forward this work if it meets with any encouragement from homei am a stranger to you but you may know my character from daniel shea esq and john parker esq merchants in your city or from mr samuel yockney teadealer in bedford row perhaps you may expect me to say something of mr lieles character he is a very industrious mandecent and humble in his manners and i think a good man this is my opinion of him i love all christians of every denomination and remain with respect and sincere regard reverend sir your friend and servant signed stephen cooke baptist annual register 17901793 pages 338 and 339 footnotes 1 most of these letters were written by two colored preachers

july 19 1790 c dear brother with pleasure i receive your favor of the 20th ult more particularly as i trust the correspondence may be of use to brother andrews church concerning the origin of which i have taken from him the following account our brother andrew was one of the black hearers of george liele of whom an account was given before and was hopefully converted by his preaching from chapter iii of st johns gospel and a clause of verse 7 ye must be born again prior to the departure of george liele for jamaica he came up from tybee river where departing vessels frequently lay ready for sea and baptized our brother andrew with a wench of the name hagar both belonging to jonathan bryan esq these were the last performances of our brother george liele in this quarter about eight or nine months after his departure andrew began to exhort his black hearers with a few whites edward davis esq indulged him and his hearers to erect a rough building on his land at yamacraw in the suburbs of savannah for a place of worship of which they have been very artfully dispossessed in this their beginning of worship they had frequent interruptions from the whites as it was at a time that a number of blacks had absconded and some had been taken away by the british this was a plausible excuse for their wickedness in their interruptions the whites grew more and more inveterate taking numbers of them before magistratesthey were imprisoned and whipped sampson a brother of andrew belonging to the same master was converted about a year after him and continued with him in all their persecutions and does until now these with many others were twice imprisoned and about fifty were severely whipped particularly andrew who was cut and bled abundantly while he was under their lashes brother hambleton says he held up his hand and told his persecutors that he rejoiced not only to be whipped but would freely suffer death for the cause of jesus christ the chief justice henry osborne esq james habersham esq1 and david montague esq were their examinants and released them their kind master also interceded for them and was much affected and grieved at their punishment brother hambleton was also an advocate for them and further says that at one of their examinations george walton esq spoke freely in favour of the sufferers saying that such treatment would be condemned even among barbarians the chief justice osborne then gave them liberty to continue their worship between sunrising and sun set and their indulgent master told the magistrate that he would give them the liberty of his own house or his barn at a place called brampton about three miles from town and that they should not be interrupted in their worship in consequence hereof they made use of their masters barn where they had a number of hearers with little or no interruption for about two years during the time of worship at brampton brother thomas burton an elderly baptist preacher paid them a visit examined and baptized about eighteen blacks at another period while there they received a visit from our brother abraham marshall2 who examined and baptized about forty and gave them two certificates from under his hand copies of which follow this is to certify that upon examination into the experiences and characters of a number of ethiopians and adjacent to savannah it appears that god has brought them out of darkness into the light of the gospel and given them fellowship one with the other believing it is the will of christ we have constituted them a church of jesus christ to keep up his worship and ordinances signed a marshall vdm jan 19 1788 this is to certify that the ethiopian church of jesus christ at savannah have called their beloved andrew to the work of the ministry we have examined into his qualifications and believing it to be the will of the great head of the church we have appointed him to preach the gospel and to administer the ordinances as god in his providence may call signed a marshall vdm jan 20 1788 after the death of their master his son dr william bryan generously continued them the use of the barn for worship until the estate was divided among the family our brother andrew by consent of parties purchased his freedom bought a lot at yamacraw and built a residence near the dwelling house which their master had given sampson liberty to build on his lot and which have ever been made use of for worship but by the division of their masters estate the lot whereon sampson had built a house to live in and which until this time continues to be used for worship by andrew fell into the hands of an attorney who married a daughter of the deceased mr bryan and receives no less than 12 l a year for it sampson serves as a clerk but frequently exhorts in the absence of his brother who has his appointments in different places to worship brother andrews account of his number in full communion is two hundred and twentyfive and about three hundred and fifty have been received as converted followers many of whom have not permission from their owners to be baptizedthe whole number is judged to be about five hundred and seventyfive

they have suffered which is extremely affecting but they now begin to rise from obscurity and to appear great i have some acquaintance with their pastor and have heard him preach his gifts are small but he is clear in the grand doctrines of the gospeli believe him to be truly pious and he has been the instrument of doing more good among the poor slaves than all the learned doctors in america the friends of our adorable redeemer will no doubt rejoice to find that this large body of christians negroes under the patronage of some of the most respectable persons in their city have opened a subscription for the erecting of a place of worship in the city of savannah for the society of black people of the baptist denomination the property to be vested in the hands of seven or more persons

i wrote december 18 last and as i have not received a line from you since i send this not knowing but the other was miscarried mr green has called upon me and very kindly offered his service to deliver a letter from me into your hands he also advised me to send you a copy of our church covenant which i have done being a collection of some of the principal texts of scripture which we observe both in america and this country for the direction of our practice it is read once a month here on sacrament meetings that our members may examine if they live according to all those laws which they profess covenanted and agreed to by this means our church is kept in scriptural subjection as i observe in my last the chiefest part of our society are poor illiterate slaves some living on sugar estates some on mountains pens and other settlements that have no learning no not to know so much as a letter in the book but the reading this covenant once a month when all are met together from the different parts of the island keeps them in mind of the commandments of god and by shewing the same to the gentlemen of the legislature and the justices and magistrates when i applied for a sanction it gave them general satisfaction and wherever a negro servant is to be admitted their owners after the perusal of it are better satisfied we are this day raising the roof on the walls of our meeting house the height of the walls from the foundation is seventeen feet i have a right to praise god and glorify him for the manifold blessings i have received and do still receive from him i have full liberty from spanish town the capital of this country to preach the gospel throughout the island the lord is blessing the work everywhere and believers are added daily to the church my tongue is not able to express the goodness of the lord as our meeting house is out of town about a mile and a half i have a steeple on it to have a bell to give notice to our people and more particularly to the owners of slaves that are in our society that they may know the hour on which we meet and be satisfied that our servants return in due time for which reason i shall be greatly obliged to you to send me out as soon as possible a bell that can be heard about two miles distance with the price i have one at present but it is rather small the slaves may then be permitted to come and return in due time

delivered agreeable to your request within a month past a few of our christian friends providentially collected at my house when it was thought necessary we should commence a subscription for the building of a baptist meetinghouse in this city as the corporation has given us a lot for that purpose mr ebenezer hills and myself were appointed trustees and we have subscribed 35 6s if we can get as much more we intend to begin the work please god to smile on our weak endeavours and the place will be made sufficiently large to accommodate the black people they have been frowned upon of late by some despisers of religion who have endeavoured to suppress their meeting together on thursday evening in the week which was their custom but is now set aside so that they only continue worship from

a slave his master indulges him in his profession and gives him uncommon liberty to return to andrew he has four deacons appointed but not regularly introduced he supports himself by his own labour there are no white people that particularly belong to his church but we have reason to hope that he has been instrumental in the conviction and converting of some whites amos the other negro minister

wesleys interest also says i will be very candid with you and tell you that i think the baptist church is the church that will spread the gospel among the poor negroes and i hope and trust as there is

rent and a fiftysix acre tract of land with all necessary buildings four miles in the country and eight slaves for whose education and happiness i am enabled thro mercy to provide but what will be infinitely more interesting to my friend and is so much more prized by myself we enjoy the rights of conscience to a valuable extent worshiping in our families and preaching three times every lordsday baptizing frequently from ten to thirty at a time in the savannah and administering the sacred supper not only without molestation but in the presence and with the approbation and encouragement of many of the white people we are now about seven hundred in number and the work of the lord goes on prosperously an event which has had a happy influence on our affairs was the coming of mr holcombe

liberal supporters his salary is 2000 a year he has just had a baptistery with convenient appendages built in his place of worship and has commenced baptizing another dispensation of providence has

the rev dr thomas rees rector of this town and parish who is one of the ministers appointed by his majesty to hold an ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the clergy in this island confirmed by a law passed by the legislative body of this island made and provided for that purpose our church consists of people of colour and black people some of free condition but the greater part of them are slaves

first lordsday in every month after evening services is over and we have meetings on tuesday and thursday evenings throughout the year the whole body of our church is divided into several classes which meet every monday evening to be examined by their classleaders respecting their daily walk and conversation and i am truly happy to acquaint you that since the gospel has been preached in kingston there never was so great a prospect for the spread of the fame as there is now numbers and numbers of young people are flocking daily to join both our society and the methodists who have about four hundred religion so spreads in kingston that those who will not leave the church of england to join the dissenters have formed themselves into evening societies it is delightful to hear the people at the different places singing psalms hymns and spiritual songs and to see a great number of them who lived in the sinful state of fornication which is the common way of living in jamaica now married having put away that deadly sin our place of worship is so very much crowded that numbers are obliged to stand out of doors we are going to build a larger chapel as soon as possible our people

glorious an undertaking i preach baptize marry attend funerals and go through every work of the ministry without fee or reward and i can boldly say for these sixteen years since i began to teach and instruct the poor ethiopians in this island the word of god though many and many times travelling night and day over rivers and mountains to inculcate the everblessed gospel that i never was complimented with so much as a pair of shoes to my feet or a hat to my head or money or apparel or any thing else as a recompense for my labour and my trouble from any of my brethren or any other personmy intention is to follow the example set before me by the holy apostle saint paul to labour with my hands for the things i stand in need of to support myself and family and to let the church of

august 1802 before a large and respectable congregation the bricklayers have just raised the foundation above the surface of the earth and as our church consists chiefly of slaves and poor free people

292 pages 125 in the days when the internal dissensions of haiti are again thrusting her into the limelight such a book as this of mr steward assumes a peculiar importance it combines the unusual advantage of being both very readable and at the same time historically dependable at the outset the author gives a brief sketch of the early settlement of haiti followed by a short account of her development along commercial and racial lines up to the revolution of 1791 the story of this upheaval of course forms the basis of the book and is indissolubly connected with the story of toussaint loverture to most americans this hero is known only as the subject of wendell phillipss stirring eulogy as delineated by mr steward he becomes a more human creature who performs exploits that are nothing short of marvelous other men who have seemed to many of us merely namesrigaud le clerc desalines and the likeare also fully discussed although most of the book is naturally concerned with the revolutionary period the author brings his account up to date by giving a very brief resum of the history of haiti from 1804 to the present time this history is marked by the frequent occurrence of assassinations and revolutions but the reader will not allow himself to be affected by disgust or prejudice at these facts particularly when he is reminded as mr steward says that the political history of haiti does not differ greatly from that of the majority of south american republics nor does it differ widely even from that of france the book lacks a topical index somewhat to its own disadvantage but it contains a map of haiti a rather confusing appendix a list of the presidents of haiti from 1804 to 1906 and a list of the names and works of the more noted haitian authors the author does not give a complete bibliography he simply mentions in the beginning the names of a few authorities consulted j r fauset the negro in american history by john w cromwell the american negro academy washington dc 1914 284 pages 125 net in john w cromwells book the negro in american history we have what is a very important work the book is mainly biographical and topical some of the topics discussed are the slave code slave insurrections the abolition of the slave trade the early convention movement the failure of reconstruction the negro as a soldier and the negro church these topics are independent of the chapters which are more particularly chronological in treatment in the appendices we have several topics succinctly treated among these are the underground railroad the freedmens bureau and most important and wholly new a list of soldiers of color who have received congressional medals of honor and the reasons for the bestowal the biographical sketches cover some twenty persons much of the information in these sketches is not new as would be expected regarding such wellknown persons as frederick douglass john m langston and paul laurence dunbar on the other hand mr cromwell has given us very valuable sketches of other important persons of whom much less is generally known among these are sojourner truth edward wilmot blyden and henry o tanner the book does not pretend to be the last word concerning the various topics and persons discussed indeed some of the topics have had fuller treatment by the author in pamphlets and lectures it is to be regretted that the author did not feel justified in giving a more extensive treatment as the great store of his information would easily have permitted him to do the book is exceptionally well illustrated but it lacks information regarding some of the illustrations not only are the readers of a book entitled to know the source of the illustrations but in the case of copies of paintings and other works of art the original artist is as much entitled to credit as an author whose work is quoted or appropriated to ones use negro culture in west africa by george w ellis kc frgs the neale publishing co new york 1914 290 pages 200 net this study by mr ellis of the culture of west africa as represented by the vai tribe is valuable both as a document and as a scientific treatment of an important phase of the color problem as a document it is an additional and a convincing piece of evidence of the ability of the negro to treat scientifically so intricate a problem as the rise development and meaning of the social institutions of a people easy yet forceful in style well documented with footnotes and cross references amply illustrated with twentyseven real representations of tools weapons musical instruments and other pieces of handwork containing incidentally a good bibliography of the subject and finally with its conclusions condensed in the last four pages it is a book excellent in plan and in execution the map however which has been selected for the book is overcrowded and therefore practically useless as a scientific study its value is suggested by the topics emphasized viz climate institutions foreign influence proverbs folklore and writing system referring to the climate the author says in west africa the body loses its strength the memory its retentiveness and the will its energy these are the effects observed upon persons remaining in west africa only for a short time and they form a part of the experience of almost every person who has lived on the west coast white personswith beautiful skin clear and soft and with rosy cheeksafter they have been in west africa for a while become dark and tawny like the inhabitants of southern spain and italy if we can detect these effects of the west african climate in only a short time upon persons who come to the west coast what must have been the effect of such a climate upon the negroes who for centuries have been exposed to its hardships the moral life of the vais appears to be the product of their social institutions and their severe environment these institutions grow out of the necessities of government for the tribe under circumstances which suggest and enforce their superstitions and beliefs this is not so with respect to education it seems that the influence of the greegree bush a school system is now considerably weakened by the liberian institutions on the one hand the mohammedan faith and customs on the other so that now this institution falls short of achieving its aims and putting its principles into practice the study as a whole gives evidence of the authors eight years of travel and research and can be read with profit by all friends of mankind walter dyson the education of the negro prior to 1861 by c g woodson phd g p putnams sons new york 1915 460 pages 200 net the very title of dr woodsons book causes one who is interested in the race history to ask questions and think there are comparatively few people who know anything about the efforts made to educate the negro prior to 1861 consequently from the first page of the book to the last the reader is continually acquiring facts concerning this most interesting and important phase of the coloredamericans history of which he has never heard before and some of which seem too wonderful to be true but it is not possible to doubt anything which is found in dr woodsons book one knows that every statement he reads concerning the education of the negro prior to 1861 is true for the author has taken pains to substantiate every fact that he presents it is difficult to imagine any phase of race history more fascinating and more thrilling than an account of the desperate and prolonged struggle between the forces which made for the mental and spiritual enlightenment of the slave and those which opposed these humane and christian efforts with all the bitterness and strength at their command the reasons assigned by those who favored the education of the slaves and the methods suggested together with the arguments used by those who were opposed to it and the laws enacted to prevent it furnish an illuminating study in human nature one is surprised to find that very early in the history of the colonies there were scholars and statesmen who did not hesitate to declare their belief in the intellectual possibilities of the negro these men agreed with george buchanan that the negro had talent for the fine arts and under favorable circumstances could achieve something worth while in literature mathematics and philosophy the high estimate placed upon the innate ability of the negro may be attributed to the fact that early in the history of the country there was a goodly number of slaves who had managed to attain a certain intellectual proficiency in spite of the difficulties which had to be overcome by 1791 a colored minister had so distinguished himself that he was called to the pastorate of the first baptist church white of portsmouth va benjamin bannekers proficiency in mathematics enabled him to make the first clock manufactured in the united states as the author himself says the instances of negroes struggling to obtain an education read like the beautiful romances of a people in an heroic age indeed the reaction which developed against allowing the slaves to pick up the few fragments of knowledge which they had been able to secure was due to some extent to the enthusiasm and eagerness with which they availed themselves of the opportunities afforded them and the salutary effect which the enlightenment had on their character the account of the establishment of schools and churches for slaves who were transplanted to free soil is one of the most interesting chapters in the book the struggle for the higher education shows that tremendous obstacles had been removed before the race was allowed to secure the opportunity which it so earnestly desired in the chapter on vocational training the effort made by colored people themselves to secure economic equality and the determined opposition to it manifested by white mechanics are clearly and strongly set forth in the appendix of the book one finds a number of interesting and valuable treatises while the bibliography is of great assistance to any student of race history in addition to the fund of information which is secured by reading dr woodsons book a perusal of it can not help but increase ones respect for a race which under the most disheartening and discouraging circumstances strove so heroically and persistently to cultivate its mind and allowed nothing to turn it aside and conquer its will the education of the negro prior to 1861 is a work of profound historical research full of interesting data on a most important phase of race life which has hitherto remained unexplored and neglected mary church terrell notes in the death of booker t washington

homogeneous society where there is no racial cleavage only the selected members of the most favored class occupy the professional stations the element representing the social status of the negro would therefore furnish few members of the coveted callings the element of race however complicates every feature of the social equation in india we are told that the population is divided horizontally by caste and vertically by religion but in america the race spirit serves both as horizontal and vertical separations the negro is segregated and shut in to himself in all social and semisocial relations of life this isolation necessitates separate ministrative agencies from the lowest to the highest rounds of the ladder of service during the days of slavery the interests of the master demanded that he should direct the general social and moral life of the slave and should provide especially for his physical wellbeing the sudden severance of this tie left the negro wholly without intimate guidance and direction the ignorant must be enlightened the sick must be healed and the poor must have the gospel preached to them the situation and circumstances under which the race found itself demanded that its professional class for the most part should be men of their own blood and sympathies the needed service could not be effectively performed by those who assumed and asserted racial arrogance and bestowed their professional service as cold crumbs that fell from the masters table the professional class who are to uplift and direct the lowly must not say so far shalt thou come but not any farther but rather where i am there ye shall be also there is no more pathetic chapter in the history of human struggle than the emergence of the smothered ambition of this race to meet the social exigencies involved in the professional needs of the masses in an instant in the twinkling of an eye the plowhand was transformed into a priest the barber into a bishop the housemaid into a schoolmistress the daylaborer into a lawyer and the porter into a physician these high places of intellectual and professional authority into which they found themselves thrust by stress of social necessity had to be operated with at least some semblance of conformity to the standards which had been established by the european through the traditions of the ages the higher place in society occupied by the choicest members of the white race and that too after long years of arduous preparation had to be assumed by black men without personal or formal fitness the stronger and more aggressive natures pushed themselves into these higher callings by sheer force of untutored energy and uncontrolled ambition an accurate study of the healing art as practiced by negroes in africa as well as its continuance after transplantation in america would form an investigation of great historical interest this however is not the purpose of this paper it is sufficient to note the fact that witchcraft and the control of disease through roots herbs charms and conjuration are universally practiced on the continent of africa indeed the medicine man has a standing and influence that is sometimes superior to that of kings and queens the natives of africa have discovered their own materia medica by actual practice and experience with the medicinal value of minerals and plants it must be borne in mind that any pharmacopeia must rest upon the basis of practical experiment and experience the science of medicine was developed by man in his groping to relieve pain and to curb disease and was not handed down ready made from the skies in this groping the african like the rest of the children of men has been feeling after the right remedies if haply he might find them it was inevitable that the prevailing practice of conjuration in africa should be found among negroes after they had been transferred to the new continent the conjure man was well known in every slave community he generally turned his art however to malevolent rather than benevolent uses but this was not always the case not infrequently these medicine men gained such wide celebrity among their own race as to attract the attention of the whites as early as 1792 a negro by the name of cesar1 had gained such distinction for his curative knowledge of roots and herbs that the assembly of south carolina purchased his freedom and gave him an annuity of one hundred pounds that slaves not infrequently held high rank among their own race as professional men may be seen from the advertisements of colonial days a runaway negro named simon was in 1740 advertised in the pennsylvania gazette2 as being able to bleed and draw teeth and pretending to be a great doctor among his people referring in 1797 to a fugitive slave of charleston south carolina the city gazette and daily advertiser3 said he passes for a doctor among people of his color and it is supposed practices in that capacity about town the contact of such practitioners with the white race was due to the fact that the profession of the barber was at one time united with that of the physician the practice of phlebotomy was considered an essential part of the doctors work as the negro early became a barber and the profession was united with that of the physician it is natural to suppose that he too would assume the latter function that phlebotomy was considered an essential part of the practice of the medicine is seen from the fact that it was practiced upon george washington in his last illness an instance of this sort of professional development among the negroes appears in the case of the barber joseph ferguson prior to 1861 he lived in richmond virginia uniting the three occupations of leecher cupper and barber this led to his taking up the study of medicine in michigan where he graduated and practiced for many years the first regularly recognized negro physician of whom there is a complete record was james derham of new orleans he was born in philadelphia in 1762 where he was taught to read and write and instructed in the principles of christianity when a boy he was transferred by his master to dr john kearsley jr who employed him occasionally to compound medicines and to perform some of the more humble acts of attention to his patients upon the death of dr kearsley he became after passing through several hands the property of dr george west surgeon to the sixteenth british regiment under whom during the revolutionary war he performed many of the menial duties of the medical profession at the close of the war he was sold by dr west to dr robert dove at new orleans who employed him as an assistant in his business in which capacity he gained so much of his confidence and friendship that he consented to liberate him after two or three years upon easy terms from dr derhams numerous opportunities of improving in medicine he became so well acquainted with the healing art as to commence practicing in new orleans under the patronage of his last master he once did business to the amount of three thousand dollars a year benjamin rush who had the opportunity to meet him said i have conversed with him upon most of the acute and epidemic diseases of the country where he lives and was pleased to find him perfectly acquainted with the modern simple mode of practice on those diseases i expected to have suggested some new medicines to him but he suggested many more to me he is very modest and engaging in his manners he speaks french fluently and has some knowledge of the spanish language4 the most noted colored physician after the time of james derham was doctor james mccune smith a graduate of the university of glasgow he began the practice of medicine in new york about 1837 and soon distinguished himself as a physician and surgeon he passed as a man of unusual merit not only among his own people but among the best elements of that metropolis that he was appreciated by the leading white physicians of the city is evidenced by the fact that in 1852 he was nominated as one of the five men to draft a constitution for the statistic institute of which he became a leading member for a number of years he held the position of physician to the colored orphan asylum serving on the staff with a number of white doctors living in a day when the negro was the subject of much anthropological and physiological discussion doctor smith could not resist participating in this controversy there were at this time a number of persons who were resorting to science to prove the inferiority of the negro given a hearing extending over several evenings doctor smith ably discussed the comparative anatomy of the races before an assembly of the most distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the city triumphing over his antagonist in 1846 he produced a valuable work entitled the influence of climate on longevity with special reference to insurance this paper was written as a refutation of a disquisition of john c calhoun on the colored race among other things doctor smith said the reason why the proportion of mortality is not a measure of longevity is the following the proportion of mortality is a statement of how many persons die in a population this of course does not state the age at which those persons die if 1 in 45 die in sweden and 1 in 22 in grenada the age of the dead might be alike in both countries here the greater mortality might actually accompany the greater longevity5 the first real impetus to bring negroes in considerable numbers into the professional world came from the american colonization society which in the early years flourished in the south as well as in the north this organization hoped to return the free negroes to africa and undertook to prepare professional leaders of their race for the liberian colony to execute this scheme leaders of the colonization movement endeavored to educate negroes in mechanic arts agriculture science and biblical literature exceptionally bright youths were to be given special training as catechists teachers preachers and physicians not much was said about what they were doing but now and then appeared notices of negroes who had been prepared privately in the south or publicly in the north for service in liberia dr william taylor and dr fleet were thus educated in the district of columbia in the same way john v degrasse of new york and thomas j white of brooklyn were allowed to complete the medical course at bowdoin in 1849 in 1854 dr degrasse was admitted as a member of the massachusetts medical society in 1858 the berkshire medical school graduated two colored doctors who were gratuitously educated by the american educational society6 dr a t augusta studied medicine at the university of toronto he qualified by competitive examination and obtained the position of surgeon in the united states army being the first negro to hold such a position after the war he became one of the leading colored physicians in the district of columbia prior to 1861 negroes had taken courses at the medical school of the university of new york caselton medical school in vermont berkshire medical school in pittsfield massachusetts the rush medical school in chicago the eclectic medical school in philadelphia the homeopathic college of cleveland and the medical school of harvard university the next colored physician of prominence was martin r delany delany grew to manhood in pittsburgh where early in his career he began the study of medicine but abandoned it for pursuits in other parts in 1849 he returned to that city and resumed his studies under doctors joseph p gazzan and francis j lemoyne who secured for him admission to the medical department of harvard college after he had been refused by the university pennsylvania jefferson college and the medical colleges of albany and geneva new york after leaving harvard he like dr smith became interested in the discussion of the superiority and inferiority of races and traveled extensively through the west lecturing with some success on the physiological aspect of these subjects he then returned to pittsburgh where he became a practitioner and distinguished himself in treating the cholera during the epidemic of 1854 about this time his worth to the community was attested by his appointment as a member of the subcommittee of referees who furnished the municipal board of charity with medical advice as to the needs of white and colored persons desiring aid in 1856 he removed to chatham canada where he practiced medicine a number of years doctor delany thereafter like william wells brown an occasional physician devoted most of his time to the uplift of his people traveling in america africa and england he became such a worker among his people that he was known as a leader rather than a physician he served in the civil war as a commissioned officer of the united states army ranking as major up to this point the colored physician had appeared as an occasional or exceptional individual but hardly as forming a professional class following the wake of the civil war colleges and universities were planted in all parts of the south for the sake of preparing leaders for the newly emancipated race several medical schools were established in connection with these institutions the rise of the negro physician as a professional class may be dated from the establishment of these institutions the school of medicine of howard university washington dc and the meharry medical college at nashville tennessee proved to be the strongest of these institutions and today are supplying the negro medical profession with a large number of its annual recruits dr charles b purvis who was graduated from the medical college of western reserve university in cleveland ohio in 1865 is perhaps the oldest colored physician in the united states and by general consent ranks as dean of the fraternity he shared with dr a t augusta the honor of being one of the few colored men to become surgeons in the united states army shortly after graduation he was made assistant surgeon in the freedmens hospital at washington dc with which institution he was connected during the entire period of his active professional life the development and present position of the medical school at howard university is due to dr purvis more than to any other single individual for several years he has been retired upon the carnegie foundation dr george w hubbard a distinguished white physician dean of the meharry medical college nashville tennessee has also been a great pioneer and promoter of the medical education of the negro race at first the negro patient refused to put confidence in the physician of his own race notwithstanding the closer intimacy of social contact it was not until after he had demonstrated his competency to treat disease as well as his white competitor that he was able to win recognition among his own people the colored physician is everywhere in open competition with the white practitioner who never refuses to treat negro patients if allowed to assume the disdainful attitude of racial superiority if the negro doctor did not secure practically as good results in the treatment of disease as the white physician he would soon find himself without patients according to the last census there were in the united states 3077 negro physicians and 478 negro dentists when we consider the professional needs of ten millions of negroes it will be seen that the quota is not over one fourth full there is urgent need especially for an additional number of pharmacists and dentists it must be said for the negro physician that their membership more fully measures up to the full status of a professional class than that of any other profession among colored men every member of the profession must have a stated medical education based upon considerable academic preparation sufficient to enable them to pass the rigid tests of state boards in various parts of the country the best regulated medical schools are now requiring at least two years of college training as a basis for entering upon the study of medicine under the stimulus of these higher standards the negro medical profession will become more thoroughly equipped and proficient in the years to come these physicians maintain a national medical association which meets annually in different parts of the country and prepare and discuss papers bearing upon the various phases of their profession there are under the control of negro physicians a number of hospitals where are performed operations verging upon the limits of surgical skill the profession has developed not a few physicians and surgeons whose ability has won recognition throughout their profession a number of them have performed operations which have attracted wide attention and have contributed to leading journals discussions dealing with the various forms and phases of disease as well as their medical and surgical treatment by reason of the stratum which the negro occupies the race is an easy prey to disease that affects the health of the whole nation the germs of disease have no race prejudice they do not even draw the line at social equality but gnaw with equal avidity at the vitals of white and black alike and pass with the greatest freedom of intercourse from the one to the other one touch of disease makes the whole world kin and also kind the negro physician comes into immediate contact with the masses of his race he is the missionary of good health his ministration is not only to his own race but to the community and to the nation as a whole the white plague seems to love the black victim this disease must be stamped out by the nation through concerted action the negro physician is one of the most efficient agencies to render this national service during the entire history of the race on this continent there has been no more striking indication of its capacity for selfreclamation and of its ability to maintain a professional class on the basis of scientific efficiency than the rise and success of the negro physician kelly miller footnotes 1 the negro cesars cure for poison take the roots of plantane and wild hoarhound fresh or dried three ounces boil them together in two quarts of water to one quart and strain it of this decoction let the patient take one third part three mornings fasting successively from which if he finds any relief it must be continued until he is perfectly recovered on the contrary if he finds no alteration after the third dose it is a sign that the patient has not been poisoned at all or that it has been with such poison that cesars antidote will not remedy so may leave off the decoction during the cure the patient must live on spare diet and abstain from eating mutton pork butter or any other fat or oily food n b the plantane or hoarhound will either of them cure alone but they are most efficacious together in summer you may take one handful of the roots and of the branches of each in place of three ounces of the roots each

facts as to the participation of negroes in the american revolution have received the attention of several writers yet not one of them has made a scientific presentation of the facts which they have discovered these historians have failed to consider the bearing of the status of the free negro during the colonial period the meaning of the revolution to the negro and what the service of the negro soldiers first enlisted effected in changing the attitude of the people toward the blacks throughout the original thirteen colonies to a person who has lived in the nineteenth or twentieth century it would seem incredible that negroes the majority of whom were then slaves should have been allowed to fight in the continental army the layman here may forget that during the eighteenth century slavery was a patriarchal institution rather than the economic plantation system as it developed after the multiplication of mechanical appliances which brought about the worldwide industrial revolution during the eighteenth century a number of slaves brought closely into contact with their masters were gradually enlightened and later emancipated such freedmen in the absence of any laws to the contrary exercised political rights1 among which was that of bearing arms negroes served not only in the american revolution but in every war of consequence during the colonial period there were masters who sent slaves to the front to do menial labor and to fight in the places of their owners then there were slaves who finding it easier to take occasional chances with bullets than to bear the lash ran away from their masters and served as privateers or enlisted as freemen2 the newspapers of the colonial period often mentioned these facts in their advertisements of fugitive slaves in 1760 a master had considerable difficulty with a slave who escaped from new england into new jersey where he said he would enlist in the provincial service3 advertising for his mulatto servant who was brought up in rhode island james richardson of stonington said that the fugitive had served as a soldier the previous summer4 a few free negroes found their way into the colonial militia along with white soldiers this passed of course not without some opposition as in the case of massachusetts in 1656 that colony excluded negroes and indians from the militia and according to governor bradstreets report to the board of trade in 1680 and subsequent action taken by that colony in 1775 and 1776 it adhered to this policy5 favorable as this condition of negroes during the colonial period seemed the situation became still more desirable during the revolution itself this upheaval was social as well as political aristocracy was suddenly humiliated and the man in the common walks of life found himself in power grappling with problems which he had long desired to solve sprung from the indentured servant poor white class the new rulers had more sympathy for the man farthest down the slaves therefore received more consideration in the heat of the excitement of war the system lost almost all of its rigor the slave codes in some cases falling into desuetude the contest for liberty was in the mouths of some orators of the revolution the cause of the blacks as well as that of the whites and the natural rights of the former were openly discussed in urging the independence of the united states when men like laurens henry hamilton and otis spoke for the rights of the american colonies they were not silent on the duty of the american people toward their slaves6 in 1774 a patriot in the provincial congress of massachusetts spoke of the propriety that while we are attempting to free ourselves from slavery our present embarrassments and preserve ourselves from slavery that we also take into consideration the state and circumstances of the negro slaves in this province7 when the revolution came the negro was actually in the army before the question of his enlistment could be raised by those who had not yet been won to the cause of universal freedom feeling the same patriotism which the white man experienced the negro bared his breast to the bullet and gave his life as a sacrifice for the liberty of his country according to bancroft the roll of the army of cambridge had from its first formation borne the names of men of color free negroes said he stood in the ranks by the side of white men in the beginning of the war they had entered the provincial army the first general order which was issued by ward had required a return among other things of the complexion of the soldiers and black men like others were retained in the service after the troops were adopted by the continent8 before the various officials had had time to decide whether or not the negro should be enlisted many had numbered themselves among the first to spill their blood in behalf of american liberty peter salem had distinguished himself at bunker hill by killing major pitcairn9 a number of other negroes under the command of major samuel lawrence had heroically imperilled their lives and rescued him when he had advanced so far beyond his troops that he was about to be surrounded and taken prisoner10 and salem poor of colonel fryes regiment had acquitted himself with such honor in the battle of charlestown that fourteen american officers commended him to the continental congress for his valor11 but great as were the services rendered by these patriots of color the increase in the number of blacks in the continental army gave rise to vexatious questions there were those who influenced by the theories which had made the revolution possible hailed with joy the advent of the negro in the role of the defender of his country which they believed owed him freedom and opportunity some having the idea that the negro was a savage too stupid to be employed in fighting the battles of freemen seriously objected to his enlistment others were fearful of the result from setting the example of employing an uncivilized people to fight the british who would then have an excuse not only for enlisting negroes12 but also the indians a still larger number felt that the question of arming the slaves would simply reduce itself to one of deciding whether or not the colonies should permit the british to beat them playing their own game13 in the beginning however those who believed the negroes should be excluded from the army triumphed massachusetts officially took a stand against the enlistment of slaves the committee of safety of which john hancock and joseph ward were members reported in may 1775 to the provincial congress the opinion that as the contest then between great britain and her colonies respected the liberties and privileges of the latter that the admission of any persons but freemen as soldiers would be inconsistent with the principles supported and would reflect dishonor on the colony14 they urged that no slaves be admitted into the army under any consideration whatever no action was taken this was not seemingly directed at the enlistment of free negroes but it must have had some effect for in july of the same year when washington took command of the army at cambridge there were issued from his headquarters to recruiting officers instructions prohibiting the enlistment of any negro any person not native of this country unless such person had a wife and a family and was a settled resident15 this matter became one of such concern that the officials of the continental army had to give it more serious consideration communications relative thereto directed to the continental congress provoked a debate in that body in september 1775 on the occasion of drafting a letter to washington reported by a committee consisting of lynch lee and adams to whom several of his communications had been referred rutledge of south carolina moved that the commanderinchief be instructed to discharge from the army all negroes whether slave or free16 it seems that rutledge had the support of the southern delegates but failed to secure a majority vote in favor of this radical proposition the matter was not yet settled however on the eighth of the following month there was held a council of war consisting of washington ward lee putnam thomas spencer heath sullivan greene and gates to consider the question whether or not it would be advisable to enlist negroes in the new army or whether there be any distinction between such as are slaves and those who are free it was unanimously agreed to reject all slaves and by a large majority to refuse negroes altogether17 upon considering ten days later the question of devising a method of renovating the army however the question of enlisting negroes came up again before a committee of conference the leaders in this council were benjamin franklin benjamin harrison thomas lynch the deputy governors of connecticut and rhode island and the committee of council of massachusetts bay they were asked the question whether negroes should be excluded from the new enlistment especially such as were slaves this council also agreed that negroes should be rejected altogether18 accordingly the general orders from washington dated november 12 1775 declared that neither negroes boys unable to bear arms nor old men unfit to endure fatigues of the campaign should be enlisted the men who had taken this position had acted blindly they had failed to consider the various complications which might arise as a result of the refusal to admit negroes to the army what would the negroes think when they saw their offering thrown away from the altar of their country were the revolutionary fathers so stupid as to think that the british would adopt the same policy they could not have believed that the situation could be so easily cleared before the revolution was well on its way the delegates from georgia to the continental congress had already experienced certain fears as to the safety of georgia and south carolina they believed that if one thousand regular troops should land in georgia under a commander with adequate supplies and he should proclaim freedom to all loyal negroes twenty thousand of them would join the british in a fortnight it was to them a matter of much concern that the negroes of these provinces had such a wonderful art of communicating intelligence among themselves as to convey information several hundred miles in a week or in a fortnight19 the colonists too could not ignore the bold attempt of lord dunmore the dethroned governor of virginia who issued a proclamation of freedom to all slaves who would fight for the king endeavored to raise a black regiment among them and actually used a number of negroes in the battle at kemps landing where they behaved like wellseasoned soldiers pursuing and capturing one of the attacking companies20 referring thereafter to lord dunmore as an archtraitor who should be instantly crushed george washington said but that which renders the measure indispensably necessary is the negroes if he gets formidable numbers of them will be tempted to join him subsequent developments showed that these misgivings were justified in july 1776 general greene learned on long island that the british were about to organize in that vicinity a regiment of negroes aggregating 20022 taking as a pretext the enrollment of negroes in the continental army sir henry clinton proclaimed from philipsburgh in 1779 that all negroes taken in arms or upon any military duty should be purchased from the captors for the public service and that every negro who would desert the rebel standard should have full security to follow within the british lines any occupation which he might think proper23 in 1781 general greene reported to washington from north carolina that the british there had undertaken to embody immediately two regiments of negroes24 they were operating just as aggressively farther south it has been computed by good judges says ramsey that between the years 1775 and 1783 the state of south carolina lost 25000 negroes25 that is one fifth of all the slaves and a little more than half as many as its entire white population at the evacuation of charleston 241 negroes and their families were taken off to st lucia in one transport the scimitar26 yet in georgia it is believed that the loss of negroes was much greater probably three fourths or seven eighths of all in the state there the british were more successful in organizing and making use of negroes one third of the 600 men by whom fort cornwallis was garrisoned at the siege of augusta were negroes so effective were some of these negroes trained by the british in georgia that a corps of fugitive slaves calling themselves the king of englands soldiers so harassed the people on both sides of the savannah river even after the revolution that it was feared that a general insurrection of the slaves there would follow as a result of this most dangerous and best disciplined band of marauders that ever infested its borders27 the leaders of the revolution therefore quickly receded from their radical position of excluding negroes from the army informed that the free negroes who had served in the ranks in new england were sorely displeased at their exclusion from the service and fearing that they might join the enemy washington departed late in 1775 from the established policy of the staff and gave the recruiting officers leave to accept such negroes promising to lay the matter before the continental congress which he did not doubt would approve it28 upon the receipt of this communication the matter was referred to a committee composed of wythe adams and wilson who recommended that free negroes who had served faithfully in the army at cambridge might be reenlisted but no others29 in taking action on such communications thereafter the continental congress followed the policy of leaving the matter to the various states which were then jealously mindful of their rights sane leaders generally approved the enlistment of black troops general thomas thought so well of the proposition that he wrote john adams in 1775 expressing his surprise that any prejudice against it should exist30 samuel hopkins said in 1776 that something should be speedily done with respect to the slaves to prevent their turning against the americans he was of the opinion that the way to counteract the tendency of the negroes to join the british was not to restrain them by force and severity but by public acts to set the slaves free and encourage them to labor and take arms in defense of the american cause31 interested in favor of the negroes both by the dictates of humanity and true policy hamilton urged that slaves be given their freedom with the swords to secure their fidelity animate their courage and influence those remaining in bondage by opening a door to their emancipation32 general greene emphatically urged that blacks be armed believing that they would make good soldiers33 thinking that the slaves might be put to a much better use than being given as a bounty to induce white men to enlist james madison suggested that the slaves be liberated and armed34 it would certainly be consonant to the principles of liberty said he which ought never to be lost sight of in a contest for liberty john laurens of south carolina was among the first to see the wisdom of this plan directed the attention of his coworkers to it and when authorized by the continental congress proceeded to his native state wishing that he had the persuasive power of a demosthenes to make his fellow citizens accept this proposition35 in 1779 laurens said i would advance those who are unjustly deprived of the rights of mankind to a state which would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect liberty and besides i am persuaded that if i could obtain authority for the purpose i would have a corps of such men trained uniformly clad equipped and ready in every respect to act at the opening of the next campaign all of the colonies thereafter tended to look more favorably upon the enlistment of colored troops free negroes enlisted in virginia and so many slaves deserted their masters for the army that the state enacted in 1777 a law providing that no negro should be enlisted unless he had a certificate of freedom36 that commonwealth however soon took another step toward greater recognition of the rights of the negroes who desired to be free to help maintain the honor of the state with the promise of freedom for military service many slaves were sent to the army as substitutes for freemen the effort of inhuman masters to force such negroes back into slavery at the close of their service at the front actuated the liberal legislators of that commonwealth to pass the act of emancipation proclaiming freedom to all negroes who had thus enlisted and served their term faithfully and empowered them to sue in forma pauperis should they thereafter be unlawfully held in bondage37 in the course of time there arose an urgent need for the negro in the army the army reached the point when almost all sorts of soldiers were acceptable in 1778 general varnum induced general washington to send certain officers from valley forge to rhode island to enlist a battalion of negroes to fill the depleted ranks of that state38 setting forth in the preamble that history affords us frequent precedents of the wisest freest and bravest nations having liberated their slaves and enlisted them as soldiers to fight in defense of their country the rhode island assembly resolved to raise a regiment of slaves who were to be freed upon their enlistment their owners to be paid by the state according to the valuation of a committee further light was thrown upon this action in the statement of governor cooke who in reporting the action of the assembly to washington boasted that liberty was given to every effective slave to don the uniform and that upon his passing muster he became absolutely free and entitled to all the wages bounties and encouragements given to any other soldier39 the state of new hampshire enlisted negroes and gave to those who served three years the same bounty offered others this bounty was turned over to their masters as the price of the slaves in return for which their owners issued bills of sale and certificates of freedom40 in this way slavery practically passed out in new hampshire this affair did not proceed so smoothly as this in massachusetts in 1778 that legislature had a committee report in favor of raising a regiment of mulattoes and negroes this action was taken as a result upon receiving an urgent letter from thomas kench a member of an artillery regiment serving on castle island kench referred to the fact that there were divers of negroes in the battalions mixed with white men but he thought that the blacks would have a better esprit de corps should they be organized in companies by themselves but the feeling that slaves should not fight the battles of freemen and a confusion of the question of enlistment with that of emancipation for which massachusetts was not then prepared41 led to a heated debate in the massachusetts council and finally to blows in the coffee houses in lower boston in such an excited state of affairs no further action was taken finding recruiting difficult it is said that connecticut undertook to raise a colored regiment42 and in 1781 new york offering the usual land bounty which would go to the masters to purchase the slaves promised freedom to all slaves who would enlist for the time of three years43 maryland provided in 1780 that each unit of 16000 of property should furnish one recruit who might be either a freeman or a slave and in 1781 resolved to raise 750 negroes to be incorporated with the other troops44 farther south the enlistment of negroes had met with obstacles the best provision the southern legislatures had been able to make was to provide in addition to the allotment of money and land that a person offering to fight for the country should have one sound negro45 or a healthy sound negro46 as the laws provided in virginia and south carolina respectively threatened with invasion in 1779 however the southern states were finally compelled to consider this matter more seriously47 the continental army had been called upon to cope with the situation but had no force available for service in those parts the three battalions of north carolina troops then on duty in the south consisted of drafts from the militia for nine months which would expire before the end of the campaign what were they to do then when this militia which could not be uniformly kept up should grow impatient with the service writing from the headquarters of the army at this time alexander hamilton in discussing the advisability of this plan doubtless voiced the sentiment of the staff he thought that colonel laurenss plan for raising three or four battalions of emancipated negroes was the most rational one that could be adopted in that state of southern affairs hamilton foresaw the opposition from prejudice and selfinterest but insisted that if the americans did not make such a use of the negroes the british would the movement received further impetus when special envoys from south carolina headed by huger appeared before the continental congress on march 29 1779 to impress upon that body the necessity of doing something to relieve the southern colonies south carolina they reported was suffering from an exposed condition in that the number of slaves being larger than that of the whites she was unable to effect anything for its defense with the natives because of the large number necessary to remain at home to prevent insurrections among the negroes and their desertion to the enemy these representatives therefore suggested that there might be raised among the negroes in that state a force which would not only be formidable to the enemy from their numbers and the discipline of which they would readily admit but would also lessen the danger from revolts and desertions by detaching the most vigorous and enterprising from among the negroes at the same time the committee expressed the opinion that a matter of such vital interest to the two states concerned should be referred to their legislative bodies to judge as to the expediency of taking this step and that if these commonwealths found it satisfactory that the united states should defray the expenses congress passed a resolution complying with these recommendations48 laurens the father of the movement was made a lieutenantcolonel and he went immediately home to urge upon south carolina the expediency of adopting this plan there laurens met determined opposition from the majority of the aristocrats who set themselves against a measure of so threatening aspect and so offensive to that republican pride which disdains to commit the defence of the country to servile bands or share with a color to which the idea of inferiority is inseparably connected the profession of arms and that approximation of condition which must exist between the regular soldier and the militiaman it was to no purpose too that laurens renewed his efforts at a later period he mustered all of his energy to impress upon the legislature the need of taking this action but finally found himself outvoted having only reason on his side and being opposed by a tripleheaded monster that shed the baneful influence of avarice prejudice and pusillanimity in all our assemblies it was some consolation to me however said he to find that philosophy and truth had made some little progress since my last effort as i obtained twice as many suffrages as before hearing of the outcome washington wrote him that he was not at all astonished at it as that spirit of freedom which at the commencement of the revolution would have sacrificed everything to the attainment of this object had long since subsided and every selfish passion had taken its place it is not the public but the private interest said he which influences the generality of mankind nor can americans any longer boast an exception under these circumstances it would have been rather surprising if you had succeeded49 it is difficult however to determine exactly what washingtons attitude was two days after hamilton wrote jay about raising colored troops in south carolina the elder laurens wrote washington had we arms for three thousand such black men as i could select in carolina i should have no doubt of success in driving the british out of georgia and subduing east florida before the end of july to this washington answered the policy of our arming slaves is in my opinion a moot point unless the enemy set the example for should we begin to form battalions of them i have not the smallest doubt if the war is to be prosecuted of their following us in it and justifying the measure upon our own ground the contest then must be who can arm fastest and where are our arms besides i am not clear that a discrimination will not render slavery more irksome to those who remain in it most of the good and evil things in this life are judged by comparison and i fear a comparison in this case will be productive of much discontent in those who are held in servitude but as this is a subject that has never employed much of my thoughts these are no more than the first crude ideas that have struck me upon ye occasion50 what then resulted from the agitation and discussion the reader naturally wants to know how many negroes were actually engaged in the continental army here we find ourselves at sea we have any amount of evidence that the number of negroes engaged became considerable but exact figures are for several reasons lacking in the first place free negroes rarely served in separate battalions they marched side by side with the white soldier and in most cases according to the war department even after making an extended research as to the names organizations and numbers the results would be that little can be obtained from the records to show exactly what soldiers were white and what were colored51 moreover the first official efforts to keep the negroes out of the army must not be regarded as having stopped such enlistments as there was not any formal system of recruiting black men continued to enlist under various laws and sometimes under no law and in defiance of law the records of every one of the original thirteen states show that each had colored troops a hessian officer observed in 1777 that the negro can take the field instead of his master and therefore no regiment is to be seen in which there are not negroes in abundance and among them there are ablebodied strong and brave fellows52 here too said he there are many families of free negroes who live in good homes have property and live just like the rest of the inhabitants in 1777 alexander scammell adjutantgeneral made the following report as to the number and placement of the negroes in the continental army return of negroes in the army 24th august 1778 brigades present sick absent on command total north carolina 42 10 6 58 woodford 36 3 1 40 muhlenburg 64

other records show that negroes served in as many as 18 brigades some idea of the number of negroes engaged may be obtained from the context of documents mentioning the action taken by states rhode island we have observed undertook to raise a regiment of slaves governor cooke said that the slaves found there were not many but that it was generally thought that 300 or more would enlist four companies of emancipated slaves were finally formed in that state at a cost of 10437 7s 7d53 most of the 629 slaves then found in new hampshire availed themselves of the opportunity to gain their freedom by enlistment as did many of the 15000 slaves in new york connecticut had free negroes in its regiments and formed also a regiment of colored soldiers assigned first to meigs and afterward to butlers command maryland resolved in 1781 to raise 750 negroes to be incorporated with the other troops massachusetts thought of forming a separate battalion of negroes and indians but had no separate negro regiment the negroes having been admitted into the other battalions after 1778 to the extent that there were colored troops from 72 towns in that state in view of these numerous facts it is safe to conclude that there were at least 4000 negro soldiers scattered throughout the continental army as to the value of the services rendered by the colored troops we have only one witness to the contrary this was sidney s rider he tried to ridicule the black troops engaged in the battle of rhode island and contended that only a few of them took part in the contest54 on the other hand we have two distinguished witnesses in their favor the marquis de chastellux said that at the passage to the ferry i met a detachment of the rhode island regiment the same corps we had with us the last summer but they have since been recruited and clothed the greatest part of them are negroes or mulattoes but they are strong robust men and those i have seen had a very good appearance55 speaking of the behavior of troops among whom negroes under general greene fought on this occasion lafayette said the following day that the enemy repeated the attempt three times tried to carry his position and were as often repulsed with great bravery56 one hundred and fortyfour of the soldiers thus engaged to roll back the lines of the enemy were according to the revolutionary records negroes57 doctor harris a revolutionary soldier who took part in the battle of rhode island said of these negroes had they been unfaithful or even given away before the enemy all would have been lost three times in succession they were attacked with more desperate valor and fury by well disciplined and veteran troops and three times did they successfully repel the assault and thus preserved our army from capture58 a detachment of these troops sacrificed themselves to the last man in defending colonel greene in 1781 when he was attacked at point bridge new york a negro slave of south carolina rendered governor rutledge such valuable service that by a special act of the legislature in 1783 his wife and children were enfranchised59 the valor of the negro soldiers of the american revolution has been highly praised by statesmen and historians writing to john adams a member of the continental congress in 1775 to express his surprise at the prejudice against the colored troops in the south general thomas said we have some negroes but i look on them in general equally serviceable with other men for fatigue and in action many of them had proved themselves brave graydon in speaking of the negro troops he saw in glovers regiment at marblehead massachusetts said but even in this regiment a fine one there were a number of negroes60 referring to the battle of monmouth bancroft said nor may history omit to record that of the revolutionary patriots who on that day perilled life for their country more than seven hundred black men fought side by side with the white61 according to lecky the negroes proved excellent soldiers in a hard fought battle that secured the retreat of sullivan they three times drove back a large body of hessians62 we need no better evidence of the effective service of the negro soldier than the manner in which the best people of georgia honored austin dabney63 a mulatto boy who took a conspicuous part in many skirmishes with the british and tories in georgia while fighting under colonel elijah clarke he was severely wounded by a bullet which in passing through his thigh made him a cripple for life he received a pension from the united states and was by an act of the legislature of georgia given a tract of land he improved his opportunities acquired other property lived on terms of equality with some of his white neighbors had the respect and confidence of high

delivering you this letter is on his way to south carolina on a project which i think in the present situation of affairs there is a very good one and deserves every kind of support and encouragement this is to raise two three or four battalions of negroes with the assistance of the government of that state by contributions from the owners in proportion to the number they possess if you should think proper to enter upon the subject with him he will give you a detail of his plan he wishes to have it recommended by congress to the state and as an inducement that they would engage to take their battalions into continental pay it appears to me that an expedient of this kind in the present state of southern affairs is the most rational that can be adopted and promises very important advantages indeed i hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected in that quarter without it and the enemys operations there are growing infinitely serious and formidable i have not the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers with proper management and i will venture to pronounce that they cannot be put in better hands than those of mr laurens he has all the zeal intelligence enterprise and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking it is a maxim with some great military judges that with sensible officers soldiers can hardly be too stupid and on this principle it is thought that the russians would make the best soldiers in the world if they were under other officers than their own the king of prussia is among the number who maintain this doctrine and has a very emphatic saying on the occasion which i do not exactly recollect i mention this because i have frequently heard it objected to the scheme of embodying negroes that they are too stupid to make soldiers this is so far from appearing to me a valid objection that i think their want of cultivation for their natural faculties are as good as ours joined to that habit of subordination which they acquire from a life of servitude will enable them sooner to become soldiers than our white inhabitants let officers be men of sense and sentiment and the nearer the soldiers approach to machines perhaps the better i foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and selfinterest the contempt we have been taught to entertain for the blacks makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience and an unwillingness to part with property of so valuable a kind will furnish a thousand arguments to show the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme which requires such sacrifices but it should be considered that if we do not make use of them in this way the enemy probably will and that the best way to counteract the temptations they will hold out will be to offer them ourselves an essential part of the plan is to give them their freedom with their swords this will secure their fidelity animate their courage and i believe will have a good influence upon those who remain by opening a door to their emancipation this circumstance i confess has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project for the dictates of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favor of this unfortunate class of men while i am on the subject of southern affairs you will excuse the liberty i take in saying that i do not think measures sufficiently vigorous are pursuing for our defence in that quarter except the few regular troops of south carolina we seem to be relying wholly on the militia of that and two neighboring states these will soon grow impatient of service and leave our affairs in a miserable situation no considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia to say nothing of the many obvious and wellknown inconveniences that attend this kind of troops i would beg leave to suggest sir that no time ought to be lost in making a draught of militia to serve a twelvemonth from the states of north and south carolina and virginia but south carolina being very weak in her population of whites may be excused from the draught on condition of furnishing the black battalions the two others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men and be exempted on that account from sending any succor to this army the states to the northward of virginia will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army here and it will require all the force and exertions of the three states i have mentioned to withstand the storm which has arisen and is increasing in the south the troops draughted must be thrown into battalions and officered in the best possible manner the best supernumerary officers may be made use of as far as they will go if arms are wanted for their troops and no better way of supplying them is to be found we should endeavor to levy a contribution of arms upon the militia at large extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means i fear this southern business will become a very grave one with the truest respect and esteem i am sir your most obedient servant alexander hamilton 48 the resolutions of congress were as follows resolved that it be recommended to the states of south carolina and georgia if they shall think the same expedient to take measures immediately for raising three thousand ablebodied negroes that the said negroes be formed into separate corps as battalions according to the arrangements adopted for the main army to be commanded by white commissioned and noncommissioned officers that the commissioned officers be appointed by the said states that the noncommissioned officers may if the said states respectively shall think proper be taken from among the noncommissioned officers and soldiers of the continental battalions of the said states respectively that the governors of the said states together with the commanding officer of the southern army be empowered to incorporate the several continental battalions of their states with each other respectively agreeably to the arrangement of the army as established by the resolutions of may 27 1778 and to appoint such of the supernumerary officers to command the said negroes as shall choose to go into that service resolved that congress will make provision for paying the proprietors of such negroes as shall be enlisted for the service of the united states during the war a full compensation for the property at a rate not exceeding one thousand dollars for each active ablebodied negro man of standard size not exceeding thirtyfive years of age who shall be so enlisted and pass muster that no pay or bounty be allowed to the said negroes but that they be clothed and subsisted at the expense of the united states that every negro who shall well and faithfully serve as a soldier to the end of the present war and shall return his arms be emancipated and receive the sum of fifty dollars in connection with this congress passed also the following resolution whereas john laurens esq who has heretofore acted as aidedecamp to the commanderinchief is desirous of repairing to south carolina with a design to assist in defence of the southern states resolved that a commission of lieutenantcolonel be granted to the said john laurens esq journals of the continental congress 1779 pp 386 418 49 sparks writings of washington viii

austin dabney a remarkable free man of color died at zebulon his remains repose we understand near those of his friend harris the following account of dabney as given by governor gilmer may be interesting in the beginning of the revolutionary conflict a man by the name of aycock removed to wilkes county having in his possession a mulatto boy who passed for and was treated as his slave the boy had been called austin to which the captain to whose company he was attached added dabney dabney proved himself a good soldier in many a skirmish with the british and tories he acted a conspicuous part he was with colonel elijah clarke in the battle of kettle creek and was severely wounded by a rifleball passing through his thigh by which he was made a cripple for life he was unable to do further military duty and was without means to procure due attention to his wound which threatened his life in this suffering condition he was taken into the house of a mr harris where he was kindly cared for until he recovered he afterwards labored for harris and his family more faithfully than any slave could have been made to do after the close of the war when prosperous times came austin dabney acquired property in the year 18 he removed to madison county carrying with him his benefactor and family here he became noted for his great fondness for horses and the turf he attended all the races in the neighboring counties and betted to the extent of his means his courteous behavior and good temper always secured him gentlemen backers his means were aided by a pension which he received from the united states in the distribution of the public lands by lottery among the people of georgia the legislature gave to dabney a lot of land in the county of walton the hon mr upson then a representative from oglethorpe was the member who moved the passage of the law giving him the lot of land at the election for members of the legislature the year after the county of madison was distracted by the animosity and strife of an austin dabney and an antiaustin dabney party many of the people were highly incensed that a mulatto negro should receive a gift of the land which belonged to the freemen of georgia dabney soon after removed to the land given him by the state and carried with him the family of harris and continued to labor for them and appropriated whatever he made for their support except what was necessary for his coarse clothing and food upon his death he left them all his property the eldest son of his benefactor he sent to franklin college and afterwards supported him whilst he studied law with mr upson in lexington when harris was undergoing his examination austin was standing outside of the bar exhibiting great anxiety in his countenance and when his young protg was sworn in he burst into a flood of tears he understood his situation very well and never was guilty of impertinence he was one of the best chroniclers of the events of the revolutionary war in georgia judge dooly thought much of him for he had served under his father colonel dooly it was dabneys custom to be at the public house in madison where the judge stopped during court and he took much pains in seeing his horse well attended to he frequently came into the room where the judges and lawyers were assembled on the evening before the court and seated himself upon a stool or some low place where he would commence a parley with any one who chose to talk with him he drew his pension in savannah where he went once a year for this purpose on one occasion he went to savannah in company with his neighbor colonel wyley pope they traveled together on the most familiar terms until they arrived in the streets of the town then the colonel observed to austin that he was a man of sense and knew that it was not suitable to be seen riding side by side with a colored man through the streets of savannah to which austin replied that he understood that matter very well accordingly when they came to the principal street austin checked his horse and fell behind they had not gone very far before colonel pope passed the house of general james jackson who was then governor of the state upon looking back he saw the governor run out of the house seize austins hand shake it as if he had been his long absent brother draw him from his horse and carry him into his house where he stayed whilst in town colonel pope used to tell this anecdote with much glee adding that he felt chagrined when he ascertained that whilst he passed his time at a tavern unknown and uncared for austin was the honored guest of the governor whites historical collections 584 freedom and slavery in appalachian america to understand the problem of harmonizing freedom and slavery in appalachian america we must keep in mind two different stocks coming in some cases from the same mother country and subject here to the same government why they differed so widely was due to their peculiar ideals formed prior to their emigration from europe and to their environment in the new world to the tidewater came a class whose character and purposes although not altogether alike easily enabled them to develop into an aristocratic class all of them were trying to lighten the burdens of life in this section favored with fertile soil mild climate navigable streams and good harbors facilitating direct trade with europe the conservative easygoing wealthseeking exploiting adventurers finally fell back on the institution of slavery which furnished the basis for a large plantation system of seeming principalities in the course of time too there arose in the few towns of the coast a number of prosperous business men whose bearing was equally as aristocratic as that of the masters of plantations1 these elements constituted the rustic nobility which lorded it over the unfortunate settlers whom the plantation system forced to go into the interior to take up land eliminating thus an enterprising middle class the colonists tended to become more aristocratic near the shore in this congenial atmosphere the eastern people were content to dwell the east had the west in mind and said much about its inexhaustible resources but with the exception of obtaining there grants of land nothing definite toward the conquest of this section was done because of the handicap of slavery which precluded the possibility of a rapid expansion of the plantation group in the slave states separated thus by high ranges of mountains which prevented the unification of the interests of the sections the west was left for conquest by a hardy race of european dissenters who were capable of a more rapid growth2 these were the germans and scotchirish with a sprinkling of huguenots quakers and poor whites who had served their time as indentured servants in the east3 the unsettled condition of europe during its devastating wars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries caused many of foreign stocks to seek homes in america where they hoped to realize political liberty and religious freedom many of these germans first settled in the mountainous district of pennsylvania and maryland and then migrated later to the lower part of the shenandoah valley while the scotchirish took possession of the upper part of that section thereafter the shenandoah valley became a thoroughfare for a continuous movement of these immigrants toward the south into the uplands and mountains of the carolinas georgia kentucky and tennessee4 among the germans were mennonites lutherans and moravians all of whom believed in individual freedom the divine right of secular power and personal responsibility5 the strongest stock among these immigrants however were the scotchirish a godfearing sabbathkeeping covenantadhering libertyloving and tyranthating race which had formed its ideals under the influence of philosophy of john calvin john knox andrew melville and george buchanan by these thinkers they had been taught to emphasize equality freedom of conscience and political liberty these stocks differed somewhat from each other but they were equally attached to practical religion homely virtues and democratic institutions7 being a kind and beneficent class with a tenacity for the habits and customs of their fathers they proved to be a valuable contribution to the american stock as they had no riches every man was to be just what he could make himself equality and brotherly love became their dominant traits common feeling and similarity of ideals made them one people whose chief characteristic was individualism8 differing thus so widely from the easterners they were regarded by the aristocrats as men of new blood and wild irish who formed a barrier over which none ventured to leap and would venture to settle among9 no aristocrat figuring conspicuously in the society of the east where slavery made men socially unequal could feel comfortable on the frontier where freedom from competition with such labor prevented the development of caste the natural endowment of the west was so different from that of the east that the former did not attract the people who settled in the tidewater the mountaineers were in the midst of natural meadows steep hills narrow valleys of hilly soil and inexhaustible forests in the east tobacco and corn were the staple commodities cattle and hog raising became profitable west of the mountains while various other employments which did not require so much vacant land were more popular near the sea besides when the dwellers near the coast sought the cheap labor which the slave furnished the mountaineers encouraged the influx of freemen it is not strange then that we have no record of an early flourishing slave plantation beyond the mountains kercheval gives an account of a settlement by slaves and overseers on the large carter grant situated on the west side of the shenandoah but it seems that the settlement did not prosper as such for it soon passed into the hands of the burwells and the pages10 the rise of slavery in the tidewater section however established the going of those settlers in the direction of government for the people the east began with indentured servants but soon found the system of slavery more profitable it was not long before the blacks constituted the masses of the laboring population11 while on the expiration of their term of service the indentured servants went west and helped to democratize the frontier caste too was secured by the peculiar land tenure of the east the king and the proprietors granted land for small sums on feudal terms the grantees in their turn settled these holdings in fee tail on the oldest son in accordance with the law of primogeniture this produced a class described by jefferson who said there were then aristocrats halfbreeds pretenders a solid independent yeomanry looking askance at those above yet not venturing to jostle them and last and lowest a seculum of beings called overseers the most abject degraded and unprincipled race always cap in hand to the dons who employed them for furnishing material for the exercise of their price12 in the course of colonial development the people of the mountains were usually referred to as frontiersmen dwelling in the west this west was for a number of years known as the region beyond the blue ridge mountains and later beyond the alleghenies a more satisfactory dividing line however is the historical line of demarcation between the east and west which moved toward the mountains in the proportion that the western section became connected with the east and indoctrinated by its proslavery propagandists in none of these parts however not even far south were the eastern people able to bring the frontiersmen altogether around to their way of thinking their ideals and environment caused them to have differing opinions as to the extent character and foundations of local selfgovernment differing conceptions of the meaning of representative institutions differing ideas of the magnitude of governmental power over the individual and differing theories of the relations of church and state the east having accepted caste as the basis of its society naturally adopted the policy of government by a favorite minority the west inclined more and more toward democracy the latter considered representatives only those who had been elected as such by a majority of the people of the district in which they lived the former believed in a more restricted electorate and the representation of districts and interests rather than that of numbers13 furthermore almost from the founding of the colonies there was court party consisting of the rich planters and favorites composing the coterie of royal officials generally opposed by a country party of men who either denied certain privileges or unaccustomed to participation in the affairs of privileged classes felt that the interests of the lowly were different as the frontier moved westward the line of cleavage tended to become identical with that between the privileged classes and the small farmers between the lowlanders and the uplanders between capital and labor and finally between the east and west the frontiersmen did not long delay in translating some of their political theories into action the aristocratic east could not do things to suit the mountaineers who were struggling to get the government nearer to them at times therefore their endeavors to abolish government for the people resulted in violent frontier uprisings like that of bacons rebellion in virginia and the war of regulation in north carolina in all of these cases the cause was practically the same these pioneers had observed with jealous eye the policy which bestowed all political honors on the descendants of a few wealthy families living upon the tide or along the banks of the larger streams they were therefore inclined to advance with quick pace toward revolution14 on finding such leaders as james otis patrick henry and thomas jefferson the frontiersmen instituted such a movement in behalf of freedom that it resulted in the revolutionary war15 these patriots advocacy of freedom too was not halfhearted when they demanded liberty for the colonists they spoke also for the slaves so emphasizing the necessity for abolition that observers from afar thought that the institution would of itself soon pass away16 in the reorganization of the governments necessitated by the overthrow of the british however the frontiersmen were unfortunate in that they lacked constructive leadership adequate to having their ideas incorporated into the new constitutions availing themselves of their opportunity the aristocrats of the coast fortified themselves in their advantageous position by establishing state governments based on the representation of interests the restriction of suffrage and the ineligibility of the poor to office17 moreover efforts were made even to continue in a different form the established church against which the dissenting frontiersmen had fought for more than a century in the other atlantic states where such distinctions were not made in framing their constitutions the conservatives resorted to other schemes to keep the power in the hands of the rich planters near the sea when the appalachian americans awoke to the situation then they were against a stone wall the socalled rights of man were subjected to restrictions which in our day could not exist the right to hold office and to vote were not dependent upon manhood qualifications but on a white skin religious opinions the payment of taxes and wealth in south carolina a person desiring to vote must believe in the existence of a god in a future state of reward and punishment and have a freehold of fifty acres of land in virginia the right of suffrage was restricted to freeholders possessing one hundred acres of land senators in north carolina had to own three hundred acres of land representatives in south carolina were required to have a 500 acre freehold and 10 negroes and in georgia 250 acres and support the protestant religion18 in all of these slave states suffering from such unpopular government the mountaineers developed into a reform party persistently demanding that the sense of the people be taken on the question of calling together their representatives to remove certain defects from the constitutions it was the contest between the aristocrats and the progressive westerner the aristocrats idea of government was developed from the english scionthe liberty of kings lords and commons with different grades of society acting independently of all foreign powers the ideals of the westerners were principally those of the scotchirish working for civil liberty in fee simple and an open road to civil honors secured to the poorest and feeblest members of society19 the eastern planters of course regarded this as an attack on their system and fearlessly denounced these rebellious wild men of the hills in taking this position these conservatives brought down upon their heads all of the ire that the frontiersmen had felt for the british prior to the american revolution the easterners were regarded in the mountains as a party bent upon establishing in this country a rgime equally as oppressive as the british government the frontiersmen saw in slavery the cause of the whole trouble they therefore hated the institution and endeavored more than ever to keep their section open to free labor they hated the slave as such not as a man on the early southern frontier there was more prejudice against the slaveholder than against the negro20 there was the feeling that this was not a country for a laboring class so undeveloped as the african slaves then being brought to these shores to serve as a basis for a government differing radically from that in quest of which the frontiersmen had left their homes in europe this struggle reached its climax in different states at various periods in maryland the contest differed somewhat from that of other southern states because of the contiguity of that commonwealth with pennsylvania which early set such examples of abolition and democratic government that a slave state near by could not go so far in fortifying an aristocratic governing class in virginia the situation was much more critical than elsewhere unlike the other atlantic states which wisely provided roads and canals to unify the diverse interests of the sections that commonwealth left the transalleghany district to continue in its own way as a center of insurgency from which war was waged against the established order of things21 in most states however the contest was decided by the invention of the cotton gin and other mechanical appliances which in effecting an industrial revolution throughout the world gave rise to the plantation system found profitable to supply the increasing demand for cotton in the course of the subsequent expansion of slavery many of the uplanders and mountaineers were gradually won to the support of that institution realizing gradually a community of interests with the eastern planters their illfeeling against them tended to diminish abolition societies which had once flourished among the whites of the uplands tended to decline and by 1840 there were practically no abolitionists in the south living east of the appalachian mountains22 virginia which showed signs of discord longer than the other atlantic states furnishes us a good example of how it worked out the reform party of the west finally forced the call of a convention in 1829 hoping in vain to crush the aristocracy defeated in this first battle with the conservatives they secured the call of the reform convention in 1850 only to find that two thirds of the state had become permanently attached to the cause of maintaining slavery23 samuel mcdowell moore of rockbridge county in the valley said in the convention of 182930 that slaves should be free to enjoy their natural rights24 but a generation later the people of that section would not have justified such an utterance in behalf of freedom the uplanders of south carolina were early satisfied with such changes as were made in the apportionment of representation in 1808 and in the qualifications of voters in 181025 thereafter calhouns party proceeding on the theory of government by a concurrent majority vanquished what few liberalminded men remained and then proceeded to force their policy on the whole country in the appalachian mountains however the settlers were loath to follow the fortunes of the ardent proslavery element actual abolition was never popular in western virginia but the love of the people of that section for freedom kept them estranged from the slaveholding districts of the state which by 1850 had completely committed themselves to the proslavery propaganda in the convention of 182930 upshur said there existed in a great portion of the west of virginia a rooted antipathy to the slave26 john randolph was alarmed at the fanatical spirit on the subject of slavery which was growing up in virginia some of this sentiment continued in the mountains the highlanders therefore found themselves involved in a continuous embroglio because they were not moved by reactionary influences which were unifying the south for its bold effort to make slavery a national institution27 the indoctrination of the backwoodsmen of north carolina in the tenets of slavery was effected without much difficulty because of less impediment in the natural barriers but a small proportion of the inhabitants of the state residing in the mountainous districts continued antislavery there was an unusually strong antislavery element in davie davidson granville and guilford counties the efforts of this liberal group too were not long in taking organized form while there were several local organizations operating in various parts the efforts of the antislavery people centered around the north carolina manumission society it had over forty branches at one time besides several associations of women all extending into seven or eight of the most populous counties of the state this society denounced the importation and exportation of slaves and favored providing for manumissions legalizing slave contracts for the purchase of freedom and enacting a law that at a certain age all persons should be born free28 that these reformers had considerable influence is evidenced by the fact that in 1826 a member of the manumission society was elected to the state senate in 1824 and 1826 two thousand slaves were freed in north carolina29 among the distinguished men who at times supported this movement in various ways were hinton rowan helper benjamin s hedrick daniel r goodloe eli w caruthers and lunsford lane a colored orator and lecturer of considerable ability30 they constituted a hopeless minority however for the liberal element saw their hopes completely blasted in the triumph of the slave party in the convention of 1835 which made everything subservient to the institution of slavery in the mountains of kentucky and tennessee conditions were a little more encouraging especially between 1817 and 1830 the antislavery work in kentucky seemed to owe its beginning to certain emancipating baptists early in the history of that state six baptist preachers carter tarrant david darrow john sutton donald holmes jacob gregg and george smith began an antislavery campaign maintaining that there should be no fellowship with slaveholders31 they were unable to effect much however because of the fact that they had no extensive organization through which to extend their efforts every church remained free to decide for itself and even in northern states the baptists later winked at slavery more effective than these efforts of the baptists was the work of the scotchirish led by david rice a minister of the presbyterian church the antislavery element tried to exclude slavery from the state when framing its first constitution in the convention of 179232 another effort thus to amend the fundamental law was made at the session of the legislature of 179798 and had it not been for the excitement aroused by the alien and sedition laws the bill probably would have passed33 many successful efforts were made through the antislavery bodies the society known as friends of humanity was organized in kentucky in 1807 it had a constitution signed by eleven preachers and thirteen laymen the organization was in existence as late as 1813 the records of the abolitionists show that there was another such society near frankfort between 1809 and 182334 birney then appeared in the state and gave his influence to the cause with a view to promoting the exportation of negroes to liberia35 a number of citizens also memorialized congress to colonize the negroes on the public lands in the west36 in the later twenties an effort was made to unite the endeavors of many wealthy and influential persons who were then interested in promoting abolition lacking a vigorous and forceful leader they appealed to henry clay who refused37 they fought on however for years to come a contributor to the western luminary said in 1830 that the people of kentucky were finding slavery a burden38 evidently a good many of them had come to this conclusion for a bill providing for emancipation introduced in the legislature was postponed indefinitely by a vote of 18 to 1139 so favorable were conditions in kentucky at this time that it was said that tennessee was watching kentucky with the expectation of following her lead should the latter become a free state as was then expected the main factor in promoting the work in tennessee was as in kentucky the scotchirish presbyterian stock they opposed slavery in word and in deed purchasing and setting free a number of colored men among these liberal westerners was organized the manumission society of tennessee represented for years in the american convention of abolition societies by benjamin lundy40 the tennessee organization once had twenty branches and a membership of six hundred41 among its promoters were charles osborn elihu swain john underhill jesse willis john cannady john swain david maulsby john rankin jesse lockhart and john morgan42 they advocated at first immediate and unconditional emancipation but soon seeing that the realization of this policy was impossible they receded from this advanced position and memorialized their representatives to provide for gradual emancipation the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia the prevention of the separation of families the prohibition of the interstate slave trade the restriction of slavery the general improvement of colored people through church and school and especially the establishment among them of the right of marriage43 to procure the abolition of slavery by argument other persons of this section organized another body known as the moral religious manumission society of west tennessee44 it once had a large membership and tended to increase and spread the agitation in behalf of abolition in view of these favorable tendencies it was thought up to 1830 that tennessee following the lead of kentucky would become a free state45 but just as the expansion of slavery into the interior of the atlantic states attached those districts to the fortunes of the slaveholding class it happened in some cases in the mountains which to some extent became indoctrinated by the teaching of the defenders of slavery then the ardent slavery debate in congress and the bold agitation like that of the immediatists led by william lloyd garrison alienated the support which some mountaineers had willingly given the cause abolition in these states therefore began to weaken and rapidly declined during the thirties46 because of a heterogeneous membership these organizations tended to develop into other societies representing differing ideas of antislavery factions which had at times made it impossible for them to cooperate effectively in carrying out any plan the slaveholders who had been members formed branches of the american colonization society while the radical element fell back upon organizing branches of the underground railroad to cooperate with those of their number who seeing that it was impossible to attain their end in the southern mountains had moved into the northwest territory to colonize the freedmen and aid the escape of slaves47 among these workers who had thus changed their base of operation were not only such noted men as joshua coffin benjamin lundy and james g birney but less distinguished workers like john rankin of ripley james gilliland of red oak jesse lockhart of russellville robert dobbins of sardinia samuel crothers of greenfield hugh l fullerton of chillicothe and william dickey of ross or fayette county ohio there were other southern abolitionists who settled and established stations of the underground railroad in bond putnam and bureau counties illinois48 the underground railroad was thus enabled to extend into the heart of the south by way of the cumberland mountains over this ohio and kentucky route culminating chiefly in cleveland sandusky and detroit more fugitives found their way to freedom than through any other avenue49 the limestone caves were of much assistance to them the operation of the system extended through tennessee into northern georgia and alabama following the appalachian highland as it juts like a peninsula into the south dillingham john brown and harriet tubman used these routes let us consider then the attitude of these mountaineers toward slaves all of them were not abolitionists some slavery existed among them the attack on the institution then in these parts was not altogether opposition to an institution foreign to the mountaineers the frontiersmen hated slavery hated the slave as such but as we have observed above hated the eastern planter worse than they hated the slave as there was a scarcity of slaves in that country they generally dwelt at home with their masters slavery among these liberal people therefore continued patriarchal and so desirous were they that the institution should remain such that they favored the admission of the state of missouri as a slave state50 not to promote slavery but to expand it that each master having a smaller number of negroes might keep them in close and helpful contact consistently with this policy many of the frontier baptists scotchirish and methodists continued to emphasize the education of the blacks as the correlative of emancipation they urged the masters to give their servants all proper advantages for acquiring knowledge of their duty both to man and to god in large towns slaves were permitted to acquire the rudiments of education and in some of them free persons of color had wellregulated schools51 two noteworthy efforts to educate negroes were put forth in these parts a number of persons united in 1825 to found an institution for the education of eight or ten negro slaves with their families to be operated under the direction of the emancipating labor society of the state of kentucky about the same time frances wright was endeavoring to establish an institution on the same order to improve the free blacks and mulattoes in west tennessee it seems that this movement had the support of a goodly number of persons including george fowler and it was said lafayette who had always been regarded as a friend of emancipation according to a letter from a clergyman of south carolina the first slave for this institution went from the york district of that state exactly what these enterprises were however it is difficult to determine they were not well supported and soon passed from public notice some have said that the tennessee project was a moneymaking scheme for the proprietors and that the negroes taught there were in reality slaves others have defended the work as a philanthropic effort so characteristic of the friends of freedom in appalachian america52 the people of eastern tennessee were largely in favor of negro education around maryville and knoxville were found a considerable number of white persons who were thus interested in the uplift of the belated race well might such efforts be expected in maryville for the school of theology at this place had gradually become so radical that according to the maryville intelligencer half of the students by 1841 declared their adherence to the cause of abolition53 consequently they hoped not only to see such doctrines triumph within the walls of that institution but were endeavoring to enlighten the negroes of that community to prepare them for the enjoyment of life as citizens in their own or some other country54 just as the people of maryville had expressed themselves through the intelligencer so did those of knoxville find a spokesman in the presbyterian witness excoriating those who had for centuries been finding excuses for keeping the slaves in heathenism the editor of this publication said that there was not a solitary argument that might be urged in favor of teaching a white man that might not be as properly urged in favor of enlightening a man of color if one has a soul that will never die said he so has the other has one susceptibilities of improvement mentally socially and morally so has the other is one bound by the laws of god to improve the talents he has received from the creators hands so is the other is one embraced in the commands search the scriptures so is the other55 he maintained that unless masters could lawfully degrade their slaves to the condition of beasts they were just as much bound to teach them to read the bible as to teach any other class of their population from a group in kentucky came another helpful movement desiring to train up white men who would eventually be able to do a work which public sentiment then prevented the antislavery minority from carrying on the liberal element of kentucky under the leadership of john g fee and his coworkers established berea college believing in the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of god this institution incorporated into its charter the bold declaration that god hath made of one blood all nations that dwell upon the face of the earth this profession was not really put to a test until after the civil war when the institution courageously met the issue by accepting as students some colored soldiers who were returning home wearing their uniforms56 the state has since prohibited the coeducation of the races with so many sympathizers with the oppressed in the back country the south had much difficulty in holding the mountaineers in line to force upon the whole nation their policies mainly determined by their desire for the continuation of slavery many of the mountaineers accordingly deserted the south in its opposition to the tariff and internal improvements and when that section saw that it had failed in economic competition with the north and realized that it had to leave the union soon or never the mountaineers who had become commercially attached to the north and west boldly adhered to these sections to maintain the union the highlanders of north carolina were finally reduced to secession with great difficulty eastern tennessee had to yield but kept the state almost divided between the two causes timely dominated by unionists with the support of troops kentucky stood firm and to continue attached to the federal government fortyeight western counties of virginia severed their connection with the essentially slaveholding district and formed the loyal state of west virginia in the mountainous region the public mind has been largely that of people who have developed on free soil they have always differed from the dwellers in the district near the sea not only in their attitude toward slavery but in the policy they have followed in dealing with the blacks since the civil war one can observe even today such a difference in the atmosphere of the two sections that in passing from the tidewater to the mountains it seems like going from one country into another there is still in the back country of course much of that lawlessness which shames the south but crime in that section is not peculiarly the persecution of the negro almost any one considered undesirable is dealt with unceremoniously in appalachian america the races still maintain a sort of social contact white and black men work side by side visit each other in their homes and often attend the same church to listen with delight to the word spoken by either a colored or white preacher c g woodson footnotes 1 wertenbaker patrician and plebeian in virginia 31 2 exactly how many of each race settled in the appalachian region we cannot tell but we know that they came in large numbers after the year 1735 a few important facts and names may give some idea as to the extent of this immigration the shenandoah valley attracted many most prominent among those who were instrumental in settling the valley was the scotchman john lewis the ancestor of so many families of the mountains the dutchmen john and isaac van meter were among the first to buy land from joist hite probably the first settler in the valley among other adventurers of this frontier were benjamin allen riley moore and william white of maryland who settled in the shenandoah in 1734 robert harper and others who in the same year settled richard morgans grant near harpers ferry and howard walker and rutledge who took up land on what became the fairfax manor on the south branch in 1738 some quakers came from pennsylvania to occupy the ross survey of 40000 acres near winchester farm in what is now frederick county virginia in the following year john and james lindsay reached long marsh and isaac larne of new jersey the same district about the same time while joseph carter of bucks county pennsylvania built his cabin on the opequon near winchester in 1743 and joseph hampton with his two sons came from maryland to buck marsh near berryville but it is a more important fact that burden a scotchirishman obtained a large grant of land and settled it with hundreds of his race during the period from 1736 to 1743 and employed an agent to continue the work with burden came the mcdowells alexanders campbells mcclungs mccampbells mccowans and mckees prestons browns wallaces wilsons mccues and caruthers they settled the upper waters of the shenandoah and the james while the germans had

to do with making this wilderness a center of democracy it is difficult to estimate some would contend that although the western people were of races different from this aristocratic element of the east their own history shows that this had little to do with the estrangement of the west from the east and that the fact that many persons of these same stocks who settled in the east became identified with the interests of that section is sufficient evidence to prove what an insignificant factor racial characteristics are but although environment proves itself here to be the important factor in the development of these people and we are compelled to concede that the frontier made the western man an advocate of republican principles heredity must not be ignored altogether exactly how much influence the scotchirish had in shaping the destiny of appalachian america is another much mooted question with which we are concerned here because historians give almost all the credit to this race even an authority like justin winsor leaves the impression that virginia cared little for the frontier and that all honor is due to the scotchirish their influence in shaping the destiny of other states has been equally emphasized the facts collected by hanna doubtless give much support to the claims of that people to the honor for the development of appalachian america his conclusions however are rather farsweeping and often shade into imagination on the other hand a good argument may be made to prove that other people such as the germans and dutch deserve equal honor furthermore few of the eulogists of the scotchirish take into account the number of indentured servants and poor whites who moved westward with the frontier besides it must not be thought that the east neglected the frontier intentionally simply because the tidewater people could not early subdue the wilderness they did much to develop it the records of the time of the indian troubles beginning in 1793 show that the state governments answered the call for troops and ammunition as promptly as they could and their statute books show numerous laws which were enacted in the interest of the west during these troubles the truth of the matter is that whatever might have been the desire of the east to conquer the wilderness the sectionalizing institution of slavery which the colony had accepted as the basis of its society rendered the accomplishment of such an object impossible there was too great diversity of interest in that region 9 jeffersons works vi 484 10 kercheval history of the valley 47 and 48

in arabia is not at all singular by language and ethnological conformation the people of the arabian peninsula belong to the great semitic group of the human family but the proximity of africa to arabia carried the slave trade at a very early period to that soil naturally as a result of intermarriage thousands of negroes with arabian blood soon appeared in that part of asia this was especially true of the midland and southern districts of the peninsula today after several centuries of such unions there is found in southwestern arabia in northern and central africa an everincreasing colored population of vast numbers known as arabised negroes many of these have become celebrities whose achievements form an integral part of arabian civilization and mohammedan culture1 emerging from this group came antar the most conspicuous figure in arabia a man noble in thought heroic in deed an exemplar of ideals higher than those of his age and a model for posterity antarah ben shedad el absi antar the lion the son of the tribe of abs the historic antar was born about the middle of the sixth century of our era and died about the year 615 some accounts give the year 525 as the date of his birth by clement huart a distinguished orientalist he is described as a mulatto2 goddess born however says reynold a nicholson he could not be called by any stretch of the imagination his mother was a black slave3 all authorities agree that shedad his father was a man of noble blood and that his mother was an abyssinian slave the manner in which they became attached to each other is interesting as a result of tyrannical action upon the part of king zoheir chief of the absians several chieftains seceded to attack and rob other tribes and establish their own kingdom among these chieftains was one shedad in their wanderings they attacked and conquered a certain tribe among the prisoners of which was a black woman of great beauty named zebiba shedad fell in love with this woman and to obtain possession of her yielded all rights to the spoils she then had two sons shedad lived in the fields with her for a time during which she gave birth to a son as a boy his strength was prodigious and courage unparalleled in his early life antar was assigned to the lowly task of a keeper of camels here he followed the usual routine incident to such a task while the clan of his father roved from place to place clashing with rivals in quest of the prizes of the chase or the spoils of war or rested in some vale of arabia and devoted itself to the simpler pastoral life following this sort of occupation he so distinguished himself as to impress the woman whom he later married this was ibla the beautiful daughter of malek another son of king zoheir she was therefore antars cousin antars growth in courage in bodily strength sense of justice and sympathy for the weak excited her admiration and high esteem his love for ibla found expression in deeds of valor and poems dedicated to her virtues but the jealousy of chieftains and his lowly birth prevented their union the magnanimity of antar in the face of bitter opposition however and his undying love finally won him ibla as his bride favored by great strength and a leonine courage antar soon passed from the duties of a keeper of camels to those of a firstclass fighting man by these virtues so highly prized by the warlike arabs he ingratiated himself both with his father and his tribe much of the life of antar is lost to authentic history but that part which remains shows that he followed the career of a great chieftain endowed with military qualities poetic gifts and a talent for leadership of extraordinary order according to huart he took part in the terrible wars of the horses arising out of the rivalry between the stallion dahis and the mare ghabra4 treachery alone prevented the famous courser from winning the race and in his vengeance qais chief of the tribe of abs waged bitter war against his enemies antar was the rhapsodist as well as a participant in these contests success in war rapidly followed his kinsmen forgot his lowly birth and former menial occupation and regarded him as the first warrior of his day his deeds of heroism increased his prestige and after his fathers death he became the protector of his tribe and the pattern of arabic chivalry meanwhile he had shown such rare poetic gifts that his fame spread beyond the circle of his clan and in due course of time he was selected as a contestant in those poetic trials that were peculiar to the arabs in the preislamic days so successful was antars effort that he was acknowledged the greatest poet of his time and one of his odes was selected as one of the mu allakt the seven suspended poems while judged by the assemblage of all the arabs worthy to be written in letters of gold and hung on high in the sacred kaabah at mecca as accepted models of arabian style5 the death of antar is enshrouded in obscurity antar perished about the year 615 while fighting against the tribe of the tai according to one authority he had grown old and his youthful activity had forsaken him he is said to have fallen from his horse and to have been unable to regain his feet in time his death was a signal for peace and the end of the longdrawn hostility in spite of the tribes desire to avenge its hero and its bard a compensation of 100 camels was accepted for the murder of one of its scions and the poets celebrated the close of the long struggle another author says the hero stricken to death by a poison shaft sped by the hand of a treacherous and implacable foe remounted his horse to insure the safe retreat of his tribe and died leaning on his lance his enemies smitten with terror by the memory of his prowess dared not advance till one cunning warrior devised a strategem which startled the horse out of its marble stillness the creature gave a bound and antars corpse left unsupported fell upon the ground6 his fame as a literary character transcends that of the modern authors of black blood such as pushkin in russia and the elder dumas in france after his death the fame of antars deeds spread across the arabian peninsula and throughout the mohammedan world in time these deeds like the homeric legends were recorded in a literary form and therein is found that antar the son of an abyssinian slave once a despised camel driver has become the achilles of the arabian iliad a work known to this day after being a source of wonder and admiration for hundreds of years to millions of mohammedans as the romance of antar the book therefore ranks among the great national classics like the shahnameh of persia and the nibelungenlied of germany antar was the father of knighthood he was the champion of the weak and oppressed the protector of the women the impassioned loverpoet the irresistible and magnanimous knight antar in its present form probably preceded the romances of chivalry so common in the twelfth century in italy and france7 this national classic of the arabian world is of great length in the original being often found in thirty or forty manuscript volumes in quarto in seventy or eighty in octavo portions of it have been translated into english german and french english readers can consult it best in a translation from the arabic by terrick hamilton in four volumes published in london in 1820 this translation now rare covers only a portion of the original a new translation suitably abridged is much needed the fact that its hero is of negro blood may have chilled the ardor of english translators to meet this need the original book purports to have been written more than a thousand years agoin the golden prime of the caliph harnalrashid 786809by the famous asasmai 741830 it is in fact a later compilation probably of the twelfth century the first arabic edition was brought to europe by an austrogerman diplomat and scholarbaron von hammer purgstallnear the end of the eighteenth century the manuscript was engrossed in the year 1466 the verses with which the volumes abound are in many cases undoubtedly those of antar one enthusiastic critic of this romance has said the book in its present form has been the delight of all arabians for many centuries every wild bedouin of the desert knew much of the tale by heart and listened to its periods and to its poems with quivering interest his more cultivated brothers of the cities possessed one or many of its volumes every coffeehouse in aleppo bagdad or constantinople had a narrator who night after night recited it to rapt audiences the unanimous opinion of the east has always placed the romance of antar at the summit of such literature as one of their authors well says the thousand and one nights is for the amusement of women and children antar is a book for men from it they learn lessons of eloquence of magnanimity of generosity and of statecraft even the prophet mohammed wellknown foe to poetry and poets instructed his disciples to relate to their children the traditions concerning antar for these will steel their hearts harder than stone9 another critic has said the romance of antar is the free expression of real arab heroworship and even in the cities of the orient today the loungers over their cups can never weary of following the exploits of this black son of the desert who in his person unites the great virtues of his people magnanimity and bravery with the gift of poetic speech its tone is elevated it is never trivial even in its long and wearisome descriptions in its everrecurring outbursts of love its language suits its thought choice and educated and not descendingas in the nightsto the common expressions or ordinary speech it is the arabic romance of chivalry and may not have been without influence in the spread of the romance of medival europe10 an idea of this romance may be obtained from the following years and years ago king zoheir ruled arabia now shedad a son nettled under the stern sway of his sire and longed for the chase and the combat the green plains becked the murmuring streams sang until the heart of shedad grew sad when the sun rose one morn he gathered his camels and warriors and departed far from the home of king zoheir dwelt the tribe djezila in peace but shedad fell upon them and slew them as beautiful as a goddess was a black woman named zebiba who was captured now it came to pass that shedad loved zebiba and dwelt with her and her two sons in the fields in time she bore him a son as dark as an elephant with eyes as black as night and a head of shaggy hair they called him antar antar grew in strength in courage and in mind until the chieftains disputed his possession for his mother was a slave and antar must tend the herds zoheir summoned the chieftains and antar and when he was brought before him he marveled and threw him a piece of meat but a dog that chanced to be in the tent was quicker than he and seized it and ran off rage gave antar the fleetness of the wind with mighty leaps he bounded after the dog swifter darted no eagle upon its prey than antar pursued the rogue with a mighty spring he caught it and seizing its jaws tore them asunder down to the beasts shoulders and in triumph he held the meat aloft but the king grew afraid and let shedad depart with antar at ten years of age he slew a wolf that harassed his flock and later killed a slave who had beaten an old woman thus did the women find in him a protector and they hung upon his words and recounted his deeds and his acts of justice now shedads brother malek had a daughter named ibla who was as fair as the moon the ladies were wont to drink camels milk morning and evening when antar had cooled it in the winds it chanced one morning that antar entered iblas tent just as her mother was combing her hair and the beauty of her form transfixed him a thing of loveliness fairer he had never seen nor ringlets of darker hue grace a human head his heart beat wildly at the birth of a great passion and the hot blood burned his dark cheeks but ibla fled and antar left with a light heart for days he sang in measures sweet of iblas beauty and his arm burned to do deeds the weeds of the field became the fairest of flowers the limpid pools mirrored iblas face in images beautiful and pure and the zephyrs whispered of love but antar had dared love a princess and his father became wroth and came to the fields one day with some chiefs to punish him when they arrived they found antar in combat with a lion with a roar like thunder the beast lashed its tail and advanced but antar knew not fear he stepped forward to the fray the snarling creeping beast scratched furrows in the ground and bided the time for the spring then it leaped like a flash antar hurled his lance and leaped aside a gleam of light and iron met flesh as the mighty body hurtled by quickly he seized the shaft and held it firmly while the beast lashed furiously and growled in its death struggles and then it lay still but the heart of shedad was softened and he invited antar and the chieftains to sup with him long into the night recounted shedad antars deeds but the dark eyes of antar saw only ibla and his heart yearned for the morrow and the end of the feasting not far from the land of king zoheir dwelt the tribe of temin and zoheir and his warriors departed to war against them to antar was entrusted the care and protection of the women during zoheirs absence antar swore to protect them with his life and the women were not afraid but the days are long when lords are away and the women burned for entertainment then it was that semiah the lawful wife of shedad called the women together and spoke of a feast on the shores of a near by lake when the day came ibla and her mother attended and as antar saw her his heart leaped with joy just then shouts were heard and from afar appeared a cloud of dust which grew larger and filled the sky as it drew near out from the cloud of dust sprang the tribesmen called cathan and with yells they seized and carried off the women but antar sped up like the wind when he heard the shrieks of his beloved ibla and saw her anguished face and frenzied struggles horse he had none but love and despair gave him the swiftness of a steed the courage of a lion and the strength of the elephant across the plains he coursed as swiftly as the wind but the steeds were as swift as he clouds of dust choked him and hid him from view but double burdens on tired coursers could not continue the mad pace antar overtook one horseman threw him off and slew him then a cry arose among the tribesmen of cathan to kill antar but antar lusted for battle and donning the armor of the slain man he slew warrior after warrior until the tribesmen of cathan loosed the women and fled then antar comforted the women and drove many horses home before him among them a black charger when shedad returned with zoheir he went to visit his flocks and saw antar upon a black horse guarding the herds shedad inquired whence came the horse but antar did not wish to betray the imprudent action of his fathers wife and remained silent thereupon shedad called him a robber and struck him with such violence that the blood ran but semiah saw the cruel act and her heart went out to antar she clasped him in her arms and throwing herself at her lords feet she raised her veil and told the story of the attack and rescue and antars courage antars silence and magnanimity so touched shedad that he wept the news of antars feat soon reached the king who gave him a robe of honor and rich presents but jealousies among the chieftains toward antar grew and plots were made to kill him again and again he circumvented his foes and in triumphs showed infinite pity and mercy deeds of darkness but increased the mutual love between ibla and antar and the name of antar was heard far into distant lands now it happened that a youth of wealth and lineage sought iblas hand in marriage but pride choked him and he basked in the glory of his fathers deeds when antar heard of the boastful youths suit he swore a great oath to kill him and he fell upon him but the youth escaped now the chieftains saw a chance to destroy antars power and encompass his destruction they appeared before zoheir and demanded antars life then zoheir stripped him of his high estate and favors and sent him back to the fields to attend the herds and antar bowed his great head in shame and left but the love he bore for ibla was as meat to his body and refreshment to his mind and his great spirit died not soon the tribe of tex fell upon zoheir and his warriors and sorely pressed them the pride of zoheir however was great and antar stayed far from the battle for his heart was heavy and he was again a tender of herds then the day went against zoheir and his warriors and many fell and sadness came upon the land and the men of tex pressed the men of zoheir harder and carried off the women and with them ibla still antar tended the herds and came not but the mighty chieftains of zoheir came to him and begged him to cloak his wrath and do battle with them against the men of tex and antar heard the men of tex in silence and his heart gave a bound when they spoke of ibla but still he stayed in his tent and came not then the chieftains sought to move him by his great love for ibla thereupon antars face beamed and he spoke and laid down the condition that ibla must be given him as a wife shedad and malek agreed and antar girt himself and with the remnant of zoheirs army went against the men of tex now the strength of antar was that of a hundred men and his courage that of a thousand and animated by his great burning passion and with the ardor of battle in his nostrils he fell upon the tribe of tex redder sank never a sun than the plains blushed with the blood of men after that battle tears filled iblas eyes when she beheld antar and in triumph he led her back to the land of king zoheir but the heart of malek was false and bitter plots were rife and even shedad viewed in despair the rise of a black slave malek demanded that antar should give his bride a present of a thousand camels of a certain breed that could be found only in distant lands now antar read his heart and saw his wicked artifice but he set out far from the land of king zoheir wandered antar far from the wiles of malek and jealous suitors far from the tent of his beloved ibla but the heart of antar was not cast down nor did hope die now it happened that antar entered the country of persia where he was taken prisoner his captors bound him upon a horse and departed for the village of their king tidings came of the ravages of a fierce lion and no warriors dared to give it battle fiercer had roamed no lion in the land of king zoheir nor in persia whole villages fled before it and herds were but as chaff but antar begged that he be loosed and they untied his bonds and gave him a lance and he departed to attack the lion courage is half victory and the arm of antar was skilled in the art of the lance and his heart was stout but the strength of the lion was of the body whilst that of antar was of the body and the mind with a mighty throw antar hurled the lance and it found its mark but the lion bounded forward and antar stood unarmed then with a mighty wrench he jerked a young tree from the ground and with powerful blows beat down the attack of the lion he gave a mighty swing and cleft the beasts skull and it fell down and died and antar departed for the tent of the king then the men marvelled for none dared follow to see the terrible combat nor did people believe until they saw the beast then the king loaded antar with rich gifts and honors and gave him the thousand camels which he sought and antar departed for the land of king zoheir great was the rejoicing of ibla when messengers brought tidings of antars return great was the surprise of malek and the rage of the chieftains but shedads heart softened and he yearned for his son and the fair ibla gave him her hand and antar and ibla married and dwelt in the land of king zoheir to this day the fame of antar still persists rimskykorsakoff a modern russian composer has given us in his symphony antar a tone picture of this arabian negros life that opens and closes with an atmospheric eastern pastorale of great beauty it has been played during the past winter with marked success in boston new york philadelphia and washington at the concerts of the boston symphony orchestra that representative body of great musicians the remarkable career of antar and the perpetuation of his memory in history literature and music though removed by many centuries from the life of the american negro of today offers to him many thoughts for reflection while arabia of the preislamic days is not america of this generation nor the semitic people of the east like the germanic races of the west still those human qualities that make for valor for greatness of spirit that reflect genius devoted to literature and social service are compelling forces in all climes and in all races an opportunity for a free expression of them and a recognition of their potent effect in the sum total of human culture should be the mission of scholarship in all lands those elements of character which the arabs of antars day regarded as their beau ideal were found not unworthy of admiration when manifested in one of negro blood when his poetic fancy reflected the spirit of arab life his works were not rejected because his mother was an african slave but one of the best was placed among the immortal poems of his fathers country when his genius for warfare was shown it was given an opportunity to develop and serve the cause of all who preferred valiant deeds to arguments of race when his life was spent it was not looked upon as one of an unusual negro rising above a sphere previously limited to his fellows of the same blood but as an epic of success crowning human effort and worthy to be embodied in the literature of arabia as the exploits of a hero who exemplified the spirit of the people acceptable for all time as their model for valor poetic genius hospitality and magnanimity a o stafford footnotes 1 palgrave essays on eastern questions 37 et seq 2 huart a

some respects the eighteenth century slave was better off than the negro of today as a rule no negro can now get his name into the leading newspapers unless he commits a heinous crime at that time however masters in offering slaves for sale and advertising fugitives unconsciously spoke of their virtues as well as their shortcomings that the public might be fully informed as to the character of the blacks through these advertisements therefore we can get at the very life of the negro when slavery was still of the patriarchal sort and can thus contrast his then favorable condition with the wretchedness of the institution after it assumed its economic aspect in the nineteenth century we observe that the eighteenth century slave was rapidly taking over modern civilization in the west indies and in the thirteen colonies on the american continent the blacks were becoming useful and skilled laborers acquiring modern languages learning to read and write entering a few of the professions exercising the rights of citizens and climbing the social ladder to the extent of moving on a plane of equality with the poor whites to emphasize various facts these advertisements have been grouped under different headings but each throws light on more than one phase of the life of the eighteenth century slave the compiler will be criticised here for publishing in full many advertisements which contain repetitions of the same phraseology the plan is deemed wise in this case however because of the additional value the complete document must have the words to which special

london the pennsylvania gazette sept 14 1749 reviews of books the negro by w e b dubois new york henry holt and co 1915 pp 254 50 cents in this small volume dr dubois presents facts to show that contrary to general belief the negro has developed and contributed to civilization the same as all other groups of the human race the usual arguments that the backward state of negro culture is due to the biological inferiority of the race he shows to be without foundation since these arguments have been largely abandoned by creditable scholars much of the material in the book has been known for several years to readers of works of scholars on race questions as is commonly the case truths which tend to destroy deeprooted prejudices reach general readers with considerable slowness while it is not possible to treat but briefly a large subject in such small compass the facts set forth by the author will put many persons on their guard against individuals who continue to spread misinformation about the negro race the book is divided into twelve chapters contains a helpful index has a topically arranged list of books suggested for further reading and an index all of the chapters make interesting reading but those treating of the achievements in state building and general culture of the ancient african negro are especially stimulating the author points out that in egypt both as mixed semiticnegroids and pure blacks from ethiopia negro blood shared in producing the civilization of egypt another center of negro civilization was the soudan there strong negro empires like songhay and melle developed under mohammedan influence and existed for many centuries in west africa there was a flourishing group of negro city states the most famous of these being the yoruban group recent discoveries of frobenius in these parts of the continent show that the people reached a high stage of development in the terra cotta bronze glass weaving and iron industry in the regions about the great lakes inhabited largely by the bantu are found many worked over gold and silver mines old irrigation systems remains of hundreds of groups of stone buildings and fortifications the author explains that the decline of this ancient culture was due to internal wars mohammedan conquest and especially the ravages of the slave trade the fact of the existence of such culture in the past stands as evidence of the capacity of the race to achieve it is worth noting what the author thinks about the future relation of the negro race to the rest of the world he states that the clear modern philosophy assigns to the white race alone the hegemony of the world and assumes that other races and particularly the negro race will either be content to serve the interests of the whites or die out before their allconquering march of the several plans of solutions of the negro problems since the emancipation from chattel slavery he tells us that practically all have been directed by the motive of economic exploitation for the benefit of white europe because all dark races and the white workmen too are included in this capitalistic program of economic exploitation he believes there is coming a unity of the working classes everywhere which will apparently know no race line but the colored peoples are more largely the victims of this economic exploitation in answer to it the author concludes there is slowly arising not only a strong brotherhood of negro blood throughout the world but the common cause of the darker races against the intolerable assumptions and insults of europeans has already found expression he expresses the hope that this colored world may come into its heritage the earth may not again be drenched in the blood of fighting snarling human beasts but that reason and good will prevail j a bigham the american civilization and the negro by c v roman am md f a davis company philadelphia 1916 434 pages this volume is a controversial treatise supported here and there by facts of negro life and history the purpose of the work is to increase racial self respect and to diminish racial antagonism the author has endeavored to combine argument and evidence to refute the assertions of such writers as schufeldt and agitators like tillman and vardaman but although on the controversial order the author has tried to write without bitterness and bias the effort here is directed toward showing that humanity is one in vices and virtues as well as in blood that the laws of evolution and progress apply equally to all that there are no diseases peculiar to the american negro nor any debasing vices peculiar to the african that there are no cardinal virtues peculiar to the european and that all races having numerous failings one should not give snap judgment of the other especially when that judgment involves the welfare of a people the work contains an extensive zoological examination of man as an inhabitant of the world the differences in the separate individuals composing races the forces with which they must contend the morals of mankind and the general principles of human development the question of negro slavery in america is discussed as a preliminary in coming to the crucial point of the study the presence of the colored man in the south the author frankly states what the colored man is struggling for making a review of the history of the negroes of the united states he justifies their claim to political rights on the ground that they are reacting successfully to their environment the book abounds with illustrations of prominent colored americans successful negroes individual types typical family groups arts and crafts among the africans public schools and colleges j o burke the police control of the slave in south carolina by h m henry ma professor of history and economics emory and henry college emory virginia 1914 216 pages this work is a doctoral dissertation of vanderbilt university the author entered upon this study to show to what extent the southern people sought to perpetuate not slavery but the same method of controlling the emancipated negro which was in force under the slavery regime the difficulties which were met with from without and the measure of success attained he was not long in discovering that the laws on the statute books did not adequately answer the question it was necessary therefore to determine to what extent these laws were in force and what extralegal method may have been resorted to in a system so flexible as slavery one of the first influences discovered was the barbadian slave code and then the evolution of slave control from that of the white indentured servant soon then the status of the slave as interpreted by the court was that of no legal standing in these tribunals the overseer is then presented as a negro driver referred to in contemporary sources the author devotes much space to the patrol system the various kinds of punishment the court for the trial of slaves the relations between the negroes and the whites the question of trading with slaves slaves hiring their time the slave trade the stealing harboring and kidnapping of free negroes the runaway slaves the seamen acts the gatherings of negroes slave insurrections the abolition of incendiary literature the prohibition of the education of the blacks manumission and the legal status of the free negro the author shows by his researches that although amended somewhat the slave code agreed upon in 1740 continued as a part of the organic law at times some effort was made to ameliorate the condition of the blacks the kidnapping of free negroes at first permitted was later declared a crime the murder of a negro by a white man which until 1821 was punishable only by a fine was then made a capital offence the court for the trial of negroes became more inclined to be just the privileges of trading and hiring their time although prohibited by law became common and some efforts were made to give the blacks religious instruction at the same time the negro suffered from reactionary measures restricting their emancipation prohibiting free negroes from entering the state and proscribing their education the author can see why the rich planters for financial reasons supported this system but wonders why nonslaveholders who formed the majority of the white population should have assisted in upholding and maintaining the slavery status of the negro with its attendant inconveniences such a patrol service when they must have been aware in some measure at least that as an economic regime it was a hindrance to their progress in this study the author found nothing to indicate that there was any movement or any serious discussion of the advisability of abolishing slavery or devising any plan that would eventually lead to it in that state there never were many antislavery inhabitants the quakers who came into the state soon left and the germans who at first abstained from slavery finally yielded there probably was an academic deprecation of the evils of the institution but hardly any tendency toward agitation and if there had been such the promoters would not have secured support among the leading people a few men like judge oneall favored the emancipation of worthy slaves but the agitation from without gave this sentiment no chance to grow yet the author is anxious not to leave the impression that had it not been for outside interference slavery in south carolina would have been modified this would not have happened he contended because unlike the states of north carolina and virginia south carolina did not find slaves less valuable the condition of the slave in the upper country was better than that in the low lands but no section of the state showed signs of abolition this work is a welldocumented dissertation it has an appendix containing valuable documents and a critical bibliography of the works consulted it could have been improved by digesting documents which appear almost in full throughout the work another defect is that it has no index c b walter gouldtown by william steward am and rev

southwest new jersey in 1910 there were 225 living descendants from this union scattered throughout the united states from the atlantic to the pacific many in canada others in london liverpool paris berlin and antwerp for over 200 years these descendants have married and intermarried with indian negro and white with no serious detriment except the introduction of tuberculosis into one branch of

matter and method if the present high standard is maintained you and your friends will not only make a most valuable contribution to a dire need of the negro but you will add in a substantial measure to current historical data truly yours d s s goodloe principal maryland normal and industrial school why then should the new year be signalized by the appearance of a magazine bearing the title the journal of negro history how can there be such a thing as history for a race which is just beginning to live for the journal does not juggle with words by history it means history and not current events the answer is to be found within its pages but the outstanding feature of the new magazine is just the fact of its appearance launched at chicago by a new organization the association for the study of negro life and history it does not intend to drift into the discussion of the negro problem but rather to popularize the movement of unearthing the negro and his contributions to civilization believing that facts properly set forth will speak for themselves this is a new and stirring note in the advance of the black man comparatively few of any race have a broad or accurate knowledge of its part it would be absurd to expect that the negro will carry about in his head many details of a history from which he is separated by a tremendous break it is not absurd to expect that he will gradually learn that he too has a heritage of something beside shame and wrong by that knowledge he may be uplifted as he goes about his task of building from the bottom the new york evening post when men of any race begin to show pride in their own antecedents we have one of the surest signs of prosperity and rising civilization that is one reason why the new journal of negro history ought to attract more than passing attention hitherto the history of the negro race has been written chiefly by white men now the educated negroes of this country have decided to search out and tell the historic achievements of their race in their own way and from their own point of view and judging from the first issue of their new publication they are going to do it in a way that will measure up to the standards set by the best historical publications of the day the opinions which the american negro has hitherto held concerning his own race have been largely moulded for him by others himself he has given us little inkling of what his race has felt and thought and done any such situation if long enough continued would make him a negligible factor in the intellectual life of mankind but the educated leaders of the race of whom our colleges and universities have been turning out hundreds in recent years do not propose that this shall come to pass they are going to show the negro that his race is more ancient than the golden fleece or roman eagle that ethiopia had a history quite as illustrious as that of nineveh or tyre and that the negro may well take pride in the rock from which he was hewn the few decades of slavery form but a small dark spot in the annals of long and great achievements that embodies a fine attitude and one which should be thoroughly encouraged it aims to teach the negro that he can do his own race the best service by cultivating those hereditary racial traits which are worth preserving and not by a fatuous imitation of his white neighbors at any rate here is a historical journal of excellent scientific quality planned and managed by negro scholars for readers of their own race and preaching the doctrine of racial selfconsciousness that in itself is a significant step forward the boston herald a new periodical to be published quarterly is the journal of the association for the study of negro life and history a society organized in chicago in september 1915 the commendable aim of the association is to collect and publish historical and sociological material bearing on the negro race its purpose it is claimed is not to drift into discussion of the negro problem but to publish facts which will show to posterity what the negro has so far thought felt and done the president of the association george c hall of chicago its secretarytreasurer jesse e moorland of washington dc the editor of the journal carter g woodson also of washington and the other names associated with them on the executive council and on the board of associate editors guarantee an earnestness of purpose and a literary ability which will doubtless be able to maintain the high standard set in the first issue of the journal the table of contents of the january number includes several historical articles of value some sociological studies and other contributions all presented in dignified style and in a setting of excellent paper and type the general style of the journal is the same as that of the american historical review the southern workman an undertaking which deserves a cordial welcome began in the publication in january of the first number of the journal of negro history edited by mr carter g woodson and published at 2223 twelfth street nw washington by the association for the study of negro life and history formed at chicago in september 1915 the price is but 1 per annum the objects of the association and of the journal are admirablenot the discussion of the negro problem which is sure through other means of discussion ample in quantity at least but to exhibit the facts of negro history to save and publish the records of the black race to make known by competent articles and by documents what the negro has thought and felt and done the

lancaster pa 2223 twelfth street washington d c 25 cents a copy 100 a year copyright 1916 colored freemen as slave owners in virginia1 among the quaint old seventeenth century statutes of virginia may be found the following significant enactment no negro or indian though baptized and enjoyned their own freedome shall be capable of any purchase of christians but yet not debarred from buying any of their owne nation2 christians in this act means persons of the white race indented servitude was the condition and status of no small part of the white population of virginia when this law was enacted while it is not a part of our purpose in this article to show that white servants were ever bound in servitude to colored masters the inference from this prohibition upon the property rights of the free negroes is that colored freemen had at least attempted to acquire white or christian servants in a revision of the law seventyeight years later it was deemed necessary to retain the prohibition and to annex the provision that if any free negro or mulatto shall nevertheless presume to purchase a christian white servant such servant shall immediately become free3 if we see in these laws nothing more than precautionary measures against a possible reversal of the usual order of white master and black servant to that of black master and white servant they are nevertheless significant as commentaries on the extent of the remaining unimpaired property rights of black freemen only in the light of these prohibitions do we see the full significance of the last clause of the act which reads but yet not debarred from buying any of their owne nation with no evidence beyond this explicit admission in the written law of the right of free negroes to own servants and slaves of their own race it could scarcely be doubted that there were in the colony colored men known to the framers of this law who held to service persons of their own race and color but when the court records are opened and the strange story of the free negro anthony johnson and his slave john casor is read and understood we are forced to a realization of the impartial attitude of the law toward black masters not only in its outward expression but also in its actual application the story of the relation of these two black settlers in the young colony is worth relating in the quaint language of the times word for word as it appears in the manuscript records the deposition of capt samll goldsmyth taken in open court 8th of march 1654 sayeth that being att ye house of anth johnson negro about ye beginning of november last to receive a hogsd of tobac a negro called jno casor came to this deponent told him yt hee came into virginia for seaven or eight years of indenture yt hee had demanded his freedome of antho johnson his mayster further sd yt hee had kept him his servant seaven years longer than hee should or ought and desired that this depont would see yt hee might have noe wronge whereupon your depont demanded of anth johnson his indenture the sd johnson answered hee never saw any the negro jno casor replyed when hee came in he had an indenture anth johnson sd hee had ye negro for his life but mr robert george parker sd they knewe that ye sd negro had an indenture in one mr sandys hand on ye other side of ye baye further sd mr robert parker his brother george sd if the sd anth johnson did not let ye negro go free the said negro jno casor would recover most of his cows from him ye sd johnson then anth johnson as this dept did suppose was in a great feare anth johnsons sonne in law his wife his own two sonnes persuaded the old negro anth johnson to sett the sd jno casor free more sth not samll goldsmyth eight march anno 16544 john casor was not however permitted to enjoy long his freedom johnson decided to petition the county court to determine whether john casor was a slave for life or a servant for seven years of indenture the court record of the suit is as follows whereas complaint was this daye made to ye court by ye humble peticion of anth johnson negro against mr robert parker that hee detayneth one john casor a negro the plaintiffs servant under pretense yt the sd jno casor is a freeman the court seriously considering maturely weighing ye premises doe fynd that ye sd mr robert parker most unrightly keepeth ye sd negro john casor from his right mayster anth johnson as it appeareth by ye deposition of capt samll gold smith many probable circumstances be it therefore ye judgement of ye court ordered that ye sd jno casor negro shall forthwith bee turned into ye service of his sd master anthony johnson and that the sd mr robert parker make payment of all charges in the suite and execution5 in thus sustaining the claim of anth johnson to the perpetual service of john casor the court gave judicial sanction to the right of negroes to own slaves of their own race indeed no earlier record to our knowledge has been found of judicial support given to slavery in virginia except as a punishment for crime additional gleanings from the records show that this black slavemaster was a respected citizen of wealth and one of the very earliest negro arrivals upon this continent if indeed he was not one of the first twenty brought in on the dutch manofwar in 1619 every doubt of the correctness of this assertion should be banished by a perusal of the somewhat detailed evidence upon which the conclusion is based the discovery of the fact that anthony johnson was a slaveowner led to a further examination of court records and land patents for additional information concerning him in the court records of northampton county in 1653 it was found recorded that anth johnson negro hath this daye made his complaint to ye court that john johnson senr most unrightly detayneth a pattent of his for 450 acres of land which pattent sd jno johnson negro claymeth boldly affirmeth to bee his land6 a search in the early land patents of the state revealed a grant by the authorities of the state of two hundred and fifty acres of land in northampton county to anthony johnson a negro the grant was made as head rights upon the importation by the negro of five persons into the colony7 still pursuing the record of this black freeman who was able to maintain a slave the following was discovered in the records of the county court of northampton upon ye humble petition of anth johnson negro mary his wife their information to ye court that they have been inhabitants in virginia above thirty years consideration being taken of their hard labor and honored service performed by the petitioners in this country for ye obtayneing of their livelyhood and ye great llosse they have sustained by an unfortunate fire with their present charge to provide for be it therefore fitt and ordered that from the day of the debate hearof during their natural lives the sd mary johnson two daughters of anthony johnson negro be disingaged and freed from payment of taxes and leavyes in northampton county for public use8 subtracting thirty years from 1652 the date of this order of the court it appeared that this negro and his wife were in virginia in 1622 examination of a census taken in virginia after the indian massacre of 1622 and called the lists of living and dead in virginia revealed the fact that there were only four negroes in the colony beside the surviving nineteen out of the twenty that came in in 1619 the name of one of these four was mary and the name of one of the first twenty was anthony9 it may with good reason be surmised if it cannot be proved that mary became the wife of anthony and that in the course of the next thirty years they acquired the surname johnson as well as a large tract of land and a slave by the name of john casor the existence of black masters after colonial times some readers may be inclined to regard the case of the slave john casor as altogether exceptional and peculiar to an early period in the growth of slavery before custom had fully crystallized into law it is true that similar examples are hard to find in the seventeenth century when the free negroes were few in number but if from the paucity of examples it is argued that such a case was a freak of the seventeenth century and that nothing similar could have occurred after slavery became a settled and much regulated institution the answer is that slaveowning by free negroes was so common in the period of the commonwealth as to pass unnoticed and without criticism by those who consciously recorded events of the times for abundant proof of the relation of black master and black slave we must refer again to court records and legislative petitions from which events and incidents were not omitted because of their common occurrence deeds of sale and transfer of slaves to free negroes wills of free negroes providing for a future disposition of slaves and records of suits for freedom against free negroes all relate too well the story of how black masters owned slaves of their own race to require additional proof the following record of the court of henrico county under date of 1795 is an example of what is to be found in the records of any of the older counties of virginia know all men by these presents that i james radford of the county of henrico for and in consideration of the sum of thirtythree pounds current money of virginia to me in hand paid by george radford a black freeman of the city of richmond hath bargained and sold unto george radford one negro woman aggy to have and to hold the said negro slave aggy unto the said george radford his heirs and assigns forever james radford seal10 judith angus a welltodo free woman of color of petersburg was the owner of two household slaves before her death in 1832 she made a will which provided that the two slave girls should continue in the service of the family until they earned money enough to enable them to leave the state and thus secure their freedom according to law11 from the records of the hustings court of richmond may be gotten the account of a suit for freedom begun by sarah a slave against mary quickly a free black woman of the city it is worthy of note that no claim was made by the plaintiff that mary quickly being a black woman had no right to own a slave the grounds for the suit had no relation whatever to the race or color of the defendant mary quickly12 the only evidence at hand of the kind of relations that existed between black masters and their chattel slaves is supplied by the word of old men who remember events of the last two decades before the war all that have been heard to speak of the matter are unanimously of the opinion that black masters had difficulty in subordinating and controlling their slaves william mundin a mulatto barber of richmond seventyfive years of age when interviewed but still of trustworthy memory and character is authority for the statement that reuben west a comparatively wealthy free colored barber of richmond went into the slave market and purchased a slave cook but because of the spirit of insub ordination manifested by the slave woman toward him and his family he disposed of her by sale james h hill another free colored man to whose statements a good degree of credence is due corroborates in many points this story about reuben west as a slaveowner his statement is that reuben west was a free colored barber of some wealth and the owner at one time of two slaves one of whom was a barber working in his masters shop on main street so much of these statements has been confirmed by reference to tax books and court records that the entire story may be accepted as true a truly benevolent slavery the type of black master represented by reuben west or anthony johnson must be distinguished from the colored slaveowner who kept his slaves in bondage not for their service but wholly in consideration of the slaves a very considerable majority of black masters unlike the examples above cited were easily the most benevolent known to history it was owing to a drastic state policy toward freedmen that this unusually benevolent type of slavery arose during the last quarter of the eighteenth century slaveowners in virginia possessed unrestricted powers to bestow freedom upon their slaves under such circumstances free blacks became instrumental in procuring freedom for many of their less fortunate kinsmen they frequently advanced for a slave friend the price at which his white master held him for sale and having liberated him trusted him to refund the price of his freedom a free member of a colored family would purchase whenever able his slave relatives the following deed of sale is a striking example of such a purchase know all men of these presents that i david a jones of amelia county of the one part have for and in consideration of the sum of five hundred dollars granted unto frank gromes a black man of the other part a negro woman named patience and two children by name phil and betsy to have and to hold the above named negroes to the only proper use behalf and benefit of him and his heirs forever david jones seal13 phil cooper of gloucester county in 1828 was the chattel slave of his free wife janette wood of richmond was manumitted in 1795 by her mother natural love being the only consideration named in the legal instrument john sabb of richmond purchased in 1801 his aged fatherinlaw julius and for the nominal consideration of five shillings executed a deed of manumission14 purchases of this kind before 1806 were usually followed immediately by manumission of the slave scattered through the deeds and wills of virginia county records in the quarter century ending with 1806 are to be found numerous documents of which the following is an example to all whom these presents may come know ye that i peter hawkins a free black man of the city of richmond having purchased my wife rose a slave about twentytwo years of age and by her have had a child called mary now about 18 mo old for the love i bear toward my wife and child have thought proper to emancipate them and for the further consideration of five shillings to me in hand paid i emancipate and set free the said rose and mary and relinquish all my right as slaves to the said rose and mary peter hawkins seal15 indeed the kindness of free negroes toward their friends and relatives seeking freedom afforded such an accessible avenue to liberty that those vigilant white citizens who desired to preserve the institution of slavery deemed it necessary to put obstructions in the way a law which required any slave manumitted after may 1 1806 to leave the state within the space of twelve months was passed in 1806 and remained in force until the war rendered it obsolete forfeiture of freedom was the penalty for refusal to accept banishment from this act dates the beginning of this benevolent type of slavery free negroes continued to purchase their relatives but held them as slaves refusing to decree their banishment by executing a deed or will of manumission a pathetic example of this kind was the case of negro daniel webster of prince william county at the age of sixty when an illness forced him to the conclusion that life was short he sent a petition to the legislature saying that he had thus far avoided the evil consequences of the law of 1806 by retaining his family in nominal slavery but that then he faced the alternative of manumitting his family to see it disrupted and banished or of holding his slave family together till his death when its members like other property belonging to his estate would be sold as slaves to masters of a different type he begged that exception be made to the law of 1806 in the case of his wife and children so that he might feel at liberty to manumit them16 a similar petition to the legislature in 1839 by ermana a slave woman stated that her husband and owner had been a free man of color that he had died intestate and that she her children and her property had escheated to the literary fund scores of similar petitions to the legislature for special acts of relief tell the story of how black men and women who owned members of their families neglected too long to remove from them the status of property a case more amusing than pathetic was that of betsy fuller a free negro huckstress of norfolk and her slave husband the colored mans legal status was that of property belonging to his wife upon the approach of the civil war he was blatant in his advocacy of southern views thus evincing his indifference to emancipation17 feeble efforts were made by the legislature for a score of years before the war to limit the power of free negroes to acquire slaves for profit by an act of 1832 free negroes were declared incapable of purchasing or otherwise acquiring permanent ownership except by descent of any slaves other than husband wife and children contracts for the sale of a slave to a black man were to be regarded as void18 but even this attempt at limitation was passed by a bare majority of one19 within three years of the beginning of the war the law was revised to read no free negro shall be capable of acquiring except by descent any slave 20 in the opinion of a judge who passed upon this law its object was to keep slaves as far as possible under the control of white men only and to prevent free negroes from holding persons of their own race in personal subjection to themselves perhaps also it is intended to evince the distinctive superiority of the white race 21 whatever may have been their object these acts are of more significance because of the story they tell than they ever were in accomplishing the emancipation of slaves from masters of the black race the period of the existence of the black master was conterminous with the period of the existence of slavery by the same immortal proclamation which broke the shackles of slaves serving white masters were rent asunder also the bonds which held slaves to masters of their own race and color john h russell phd

years is one in which the elements of pathos humor and tragedy are thoroughly mixed and in which the experiences encountered are of a kind to grip the hearts and consciences of men of every race and every creed just as colonial americans resented their enforced enlistment for maritime service under the flag of king george so it may be assumed that with equal vigor did the little band of africans object to a forced expatriation from their native wilds even though as it happened they were destined to be in part the builders of a great and prosperous nation and the progenitors of a strong and forwardlooking race there are few incidents that distinguish the bondage of the descendants of that first boat load of involuntary african explorers that evince in so large a degree the elements alluded to as do those which cluster about the story of the edmondson children there were altogether fourteen sons and daughters of paul and amelia who passed as devoutly pious and respectable old folks paul was a freeman who hired his time in the city amelia was a slave their little cabin a few miles out of the city of washington proper was so neat and orderly that it was regarded as a model for masters and slaves alike for many miles around they were thus permitted to live together by the owners of amelia who realized how much more valuable the children would be as a marketable group after some years of such care and attention as the mother would be sure to bestow milly as she was familiarly called reared the children tilled the garden and being especially handy with the needle turned off many a job of sewing for the family of her mistress she was entirely ignorant so far as books go but paul read the bible to her when visiting his loved ones on sunday and what he explained she remembered and treasured up for comfort in her moments of despair the older boys and girls were hired out in prominent families in the city and by their intelligence orderly conduct and other evidences of good breeding came to be known far and wide as the edmondson children the phrase being taken as descriptive of all that was excellent and desirable in a slave the one incurable grief of these humble parents was that in bringing children into the world they were helping to perpetuate the institution of slavery the fear that any day might bring to them the cruel pangs of separation and the terrible knowledge that their loved ones had been condemned to the horrors of the auction block was with them always a constant shadow darkening each waking moment more and ever more they were torn with anxiety for the future of the children and so they threw themselves with increasing faith and dependence upon the master of all and no visit of the children was so hurried or full of other matters but that a few moments were reserved for prayer at their departure one after another was clasped to the mothers breast and always this earnest admonition followed them be good children and the blessed lord will take care of you louisa and joseph the two youngest were still at home when there occurred events in which several of their older brothers and sisters took so prominent a part and which are here to be related the incidents of this narrative which are reflected in its title are contemporary with and in a measure resultant from the revolution out of which came the establishment of the first french republic and the expulsion of louisphilippe in 1848 the citizens of the united states were felicitating their brothers across the water upon the achievement of so desirable a result in washington especially the event was joyously acclaimed public meetings were held at which representatives of the people in both houses of congress spoke encouragingly of the recent advance toward universal liberty the city was regally adorned with flags and bunting and illumination and music everywhere the white house was elaborately decorated in honor of the event and its general observance scheduled for april 13 a procession of national dignitaries local organizations and the civic authorities accompanied by several bands of music and throngs of citizens made its way to the open square now lafayette park opposite the white house speeches were in order among the addresses which aroused the large crowd to enthusiasm were those of senator patterson of tennessee and senator foote of mississippi1 the former likened the tree of liberty to the great cottonwood tree of his section whose seed is blown far and wide while the latter spoke eloquently of the universal emancipation of man and the approaching recognition in all countries of the great principles of equality and brotherhood here and there huddled unobtrusively in groups on the fringe of the crowd were numbers of slaves the enthusiasm of the throng frequently manifested in shouts of approval was discreetly reflected in the suppressed excitement of the slaves who whispered among themselves concerning the curious and incredible expressions they had heard could it possibly be that these splendid truths this forecast of universal liberty might include them too a few of the more intelligent among whom was samuel edmondson drew together to discuss the event and were not long concluding that the authority they had listened to could not be questioned and that they should at once contribute their share towards so desirable a consummation coincident with this celebration there had arrived at washington the schooner pearl with daniel drayton2 as supercargo captain sayres owner and a young man chester english as sailor and cook drayton witnessed the great demonstration near the white house and as might have been expected the sentiment that seemed to have won all washington found a natural and active response for when the news of the purpose of his visit was communicated by the woman for whose deliverance he had agreed to make the trip he was appealed to on behalf of others and consented to take all who should be aboard by ten oclock that night the edmondson boys actively promoted the scheme and rightly in so just a cause abused the privileges which their integrity and unusual intelligence had won for them the news was passed to an aggregate of 77 persons all of whom faithfully appeared and were safely stowed away between decks before midnight samuel sought his sisters emily and mary at their places of employment and acquainted them with his purpose they at first hesitated on account of the necessity of leaving without seeing their mother but were soon persuaded that it was an opportunity they should not be willing to neglect the pearl cast free from her moorings shortly after midnight saturday and silently with no sign of life aboard save running lights fore and aft crept out to midstream and made a course towards the lower potomac the condition that obtained on sunday morning after the discovery of the absence of so many slaves from their usual duties may be accurately described as approaching a panic had the evidences of a dreadful plague become as suddenly manifest the community could not have experienced a greater sense of horror or for the moment been more thoroughly paralyzed a hundred or more families were affected through the action of these seventy and seven slaves and the stern proofs of their flight were many times multiplied the action of the masters in this emergency is eloquent testimony that the fine orations of two days before concerning the spread of liberty and universal brotherhood had been nothing more than so many meaningless conversations when confronted on sunday morning with the fact that theirs and their neighbors slaves in so great numbers had disappeared during the night the realization of the difference between popular enthusiasm for a sentiment and a real sacrifice for a principle was borne in upon them and they found that while they enjoyed the former they were not at all ready to espouse the latter as a result the day was but little advanced when an excited cavalcade of the masters after scouring every portion of the city broke for the open country to the north designing to cover each of the roads leading from the city they had not reached the district limits however when they whirled about and galloped furiously in the opposite direction and never checked rein until panting and foaming their horses were brought up at the wharves a vessel was chartered and steamed away almost immediately on its mission to capture the party of runaway slaves fate which occasionally plays such strange and cruel tricks in the lives of men presented in this instance a machiavellian combination of opposing forces that was disastrous to the enterprise of the fugitives judson diggs3 one of their own people a man who in all reason might have been expected to sympathize with their effort took upon himself the role of judas judson was a drayman and had hauled some packages to the wharf for one of the slaves who was without funds to pay the charge and although he was solemnly promised that the money should be sent him he proceeded at once to wreak vengeance through a betrayal of the entire party even so it would seem they might have had an excellent chance to escape but for the adverse winds and tides which set against them towards the close of sunday they were approaching the open waters of the bay and the little vessel was already pitching and tossing as from the lashing of a gale the captain decided that it was the part of prudence to remain within the more quiet waters of the potomac for the night and make the open sea by light of day under these circumstances they put into cornfield harbor and here in the quiet hours before midnight the pursuing masters found them it is difficult to realize the consternation felt by the fugitives when the noise of tramping feet and the voices of angry men broke upon their ears they seemed to realize at once that they were lost and many gave themselves up to shrieks and tears until wise counsel prevailed captain drayton and his mate were immediately the storm center of the infuriated masters many of whom were loud in the demand that summary vengeance be wreaked upon them and that these two at least should be hung from the yard arm it was easily possible that this demand might have been acceded to had not a diversion been caused by some of the others who were anxious to locate the slaves to satisfy themselves as to their safety they proceeded to break open the hatchways when so suddenly as to create something of a panic richard edmondson bounded on deck and in a voice of suppressed excitement exclaimed do yourselves no harm gentlemen for we are all here richard was young muscular and of splendid proportions and seeing him thus by the poor light of smoky lanterns with flashing eyes and swinging arms leaping into their midst with an unknown number of others following some of the masters experienced a feeling of terror and dropping their guns scurried away to safety among the dark shadows of the vessel by the time the others reached the deck the shock of richards strange appearance had somewhat died away and when samuel who was one of the last appeared a sharp blow which but for a sudden lurch of the vessel would have laid him low fell on one side of his head drayton and sayres4 who were witnesses of this incident were horrified to think that having not so much as a penknife with which to defend themselves these poor creatures might be brutally murdered and notwithstanding the serious aspect of their own fortunes5 protested vigorously against such violence but for this timely interference there is but little doubt that some of these poor people would have been cruelly if not fatally injured the true condition of affairs however was speedily recognized and seeing there was nothing to fear in the way of resistance order was soon evolved out of the general chaos and then came the decision to make an early start on the return trip among the slaves the reaction from a feeling of hope and joyous anticipation of the delights of freedom was terrible indeed the bitter gall and wormwood of failure was the sad and gloomy portion of these seventy and seven souls among them then there were but few who were not completely crushed their minds a seething torrent in which regret misery and despair made battle for the mastery children weeping and wailing clung to the skirts of their elders the women with shrieks groans and tearful lamentations deplored their sad fate while the men securely chained wrist and wrist together stood with heads dropped forward too dazed and wretched for aught but to turn their stony gaze within upon the wild anguish of their aching hearts their arrival at washington was signalized by a demonstration vastly different but little short of that which had taken place a few days before the wharves were alive with an eager and excited throng all intent upon a view of the miserable folks who had been guilty of so ungrateful an effort so disorderly was the mob that the debarkation was for some time delayed this was finally accomplished through the strenuous efforts of the entire constabulary of the city the utmost watchfulness and care was however unavailing to prevent assaults the most serious instance of this kind was the act of an irish ruffian who so far forgot the traditions and sufferings of his own people as to cast himself upon drayton with a huge dirk and cut off a piece of his ear6 for a few moments all the horrors incident to riot and bloodshed were in evidence the air was filled with the screams of terrorized women and children and the curses and threats of vengeful men the whole was a struggling swaying mass which for a season had been swept beyond itself by brutish passion numerous arrests were made and in due course the march to the jail was begun with the accompanying crowd hurling taunts and jeers at every step while they were proceeding thus an onlooker said to emily arent you ashamed to run away and make all this trouble for everybody to this she replied no sir we are not and if we had to go through it again wed do the same thing the controversy that was precipitated through the attempted escape between the advance guard of abolition and the defenders of slavery was most bitter and violent the storm broke furiously about the offices of the national era in congress mr giddings of ohio moved an inquiry into the cause of the detention at the district jail of persons merely for attempting to vindicate their inalienable rights senator hale of new hampshire moved a resolution of inquiry into the necessity for additional laws for the protection of property in the district7 a committee consisting of such notable characters as the channings samuel may samuel howe richard hildreth samuel sewell and robert morris jr was formed at boston to furnish aid and defense for drayton these men were empowered to employ counsel and collect money horace mann william h seward salmon p chase and fessenden of maine volunteered to serve gratuitously8 other philanthropists directed their attention to the liberation of these slaves the edmondsons were owned by an estate the administrator who was approached by john brent9 the husband of the oldest sister of the children agreed to give their friends an opportunity to effect their purchase as he was unwilling to run any further risk by keeping them he failed to keep this promise and when mr brent went to see them the next day he was informed that they had been sold to bruin and hill the slavedealers of alexandria and baltimore and had been sent to the former city a cash sum of 4500 had been accepted for the six children and when taxed with the failure to keep his promise he simply said he was unwilling to take any further risk with them bruin also refused to listen to any proposals saying he had long had his eyes on the family and could get twice what he paid for them in the new orleans market they were first taken to the slave pens at alexandria where they remained nearly a month here the girls were required to do the washing for a dozen or more men with the assistance of their brothers and were at length put aboard a steamboat and taken to baltimore where they remained three weeks through the exertions of friends at washington 900 was given towards their freedom by a grandson of john jacob astor and this was appropriated towards the ransom of richard as his wife and children were said to be ill and suffering at washington the money arrived on the morning they were to sail for new orleans but they had all been put aboard the brig union which was ready to sail and the trader refused to allow richard to be taken off the voyage to new orleans covered a period of seven days during which much discomfort and suffering were experienced there were eleven women in the party all of whom were forced to live in one small apartment and the men numbering thirtyfive or forty in another not much larger most of them being unaccustomed to travel by water were afflicted with all the horrors of seasickness emilys suffering from this cause was most pitiable and so serious was her condition at one time that the boys feared she would die the brothers however as in all circumstances were very kind and would tenderly carry her out on deck whenever the heat in their close quarters became too oppressive and would buy little comforts that were in their reach and minister in all possible ways to her relief in due course they arrived at new orleans and were immediately initiated into the horrors of a georgia pen the girls were required to spend much time in the show room where purchasers came to examine them carefully with a view to buying them on one occasion a youthful dandy had applied for a young person whom he wished to install as housekeeper and the trader decided that emily would just about meet the requirements but when he called her she was found to be indulging in a fit of weeping the youth therefore refused to consider her saying that he had no room for the snuffles in his house the loss of this transaction so incensed the trader who said he had been offered 1500 for the proper person that he slapped emilys face and threatened to send her to the calaboose if he found her crying again here also the boys had their hair closely cropped and their clothes which were of good material exchanged for suits of bluejeans appearing thus they were daily exhibited on the porch for sale richard who was in reality free as his purchase money was on deposit in baltimore was allowed to come and go at will and early bent his energies toward the discovery of their elder brother hamilton10 who was living somewhere in the city his quest was soon rewarded with success and one day to the delight of his sisters and brothers he brought him to see them hamilton had never seen emily as he had been sold away from his parents before her birth but his joy though mingled with sorrow could not be suppressed he was soon busy with plans for the increase of their meager comforts finding upon inquiry that hamilton was thoroughly responsible the trader consented to the girls spending their nights at their brothers home he was also at pains to secure good homes for the unfortunate group and was successful in inducing a wealthy englishman to purchase his brother samuel in consequence of an epidemic of yellow fever which increased in virulence from day to day the traders decided to bring the slaves north without further delay and so a few days later they were reembarked on the brig union with baltimore as their destination samuel was the only one of the brothers and sisters left behind as he was pleasently situated with humane and kindly owners the parting from him was not so sad as otherwise it might have been sixteen days were required for the trip and upon their arrival they were again placed in the same old prison richard was almost immediately freed and in company with a mr bigelow of washington was enabled to rejoin his wife and children paul edmondson visited his children at the baltimore jail in company with their sister11 he had been encouraged to hope that in some way a fund might be raised for their ransom but it was not until some weeks later after they had been returned through washington and again placed in their old slave quarters at alexandria that an understanding as to terms could be had with bruin and hill they finally agreed to accept 2250 if the amount was raised within a certain time and gave paul a signed statement of the terms which might be used as his credentials in the matter of soliciting assistance armed with this document he arrived at new york and found his way to the antislavery office where the price demanded was considered so exorbitant that but little encouragement was given him from here he went to the home of rev henry ward beecher where he arrived footsore and weary after ringing the bell he sat upon the doorstep weeping here mr beecher found him and taking him into his library inquired his story as a result there followed a public meeting in mr beechers brooklyn church at which he pleaded passionately as if for his own children while other clergymen spoke with equal interest and feeling the money was raised an agent appointed to consummate the ransom of the children and paul with a sense of happiness and relief to which he had long been a stranger started with the good news on his way homeward meanwhile the girls were torn with doubt and anxiety as to the success of their fathers mission several weeks had elapsed and the traders were again getting together a coffle of slaves for shipment to the slave market this time to that in south carolina the girls too had been ordered to be in readiness and the evening before had broken down in tears when bruins young daughter who was a favorite with the girls sought them out and pleaded with them not to go emily told her to persuade her father not to send them and so she did while clinging around his neck until he had not the heart to refuse a day or two later while looking from their window they caught sight of their father and ran into his arms shouting and crying so great was their joy that they did not notice their fathers companion a mr chaplin the agent appointed at the new york meeting to take charge of the details of their ransom these were soon completed their free papers signed and the money paid over bruin too it is said was pleased with the joy and happiness in evidence on every hand and upon bidding the girls goodbye gave each a five dollar gold piece upon their arrival at washington they were taken in a carriage to their sisters home whence the news of their deliverance seemed to have penetrated to every corner of the neighborhood with the result that it was far into the night before the last greetings and congratulations had been received and they were permitted in the seclusion of the family circle to kneel with their parents in prayer and thanksgiving12 in the meantime what had become of samuel when hamilton edmondson was seeking to locate his sisters and brothers in desirable homes in new orleans he first saw mr horace cammack a prosperous cotton merchant whose friendship and respect he had long since won and who upon the further representation of samuels proficiency as a butler agreed to purchase him in this wise it came to pass that samuel was duly installed as upper houseman in the cammack home although situated more happily than most slaves he was fully determined as ever that the world should one day know and respect him as a free man and patiently waited and watched for the opportunity to accomplish his purpose meanwhile another element had thrust itself into the equation and must be reckoned with in the solution of the problem of his after life it happened that mrs cammack a lady of much beauty and refinement of manner had in her employ as maid a young girl of not more than eighteen years named delia taylor she was tall graceful and winsome of the clear mulatto type and through long service in close contact with her mistress had acquired that refinement and culture which elicit the admiration and delight of those in like station and inspire a feeling much akin to reverence in those more lowly placed with some difficulty samuel approached her with a proposal and although at first refused finally won her as his bride matters now moved along on pleasant lines for samuel and delia during several months but with the advent of master tom cammacks son who had been away to college there was encountered an element of discord which was for a while to destroy their happiness this young gentleman took a violent dislike to samuel from the very first meal the latter served him they finally clashed and samuel had to run away his master however sent his wouldbeoppressor with the rest of the family to the country and ordered samuel to return home this he did and immediately entered upon his duties the year following mr cammack went to europe on cotton business and not long after his arrival was killed in a violent storm while yachting with friends off the coast of norway after this event affairs in the life of samuel gradually approached a crisis while in the meantime an additional responsibility had been added to himself and delia in the person of a little boy whom they named david master tom being now the head of the house left little room for doubt as to the authority he had inherited and proceeded to evince the same in no uncertain way especially towards those against whom he held a grievance to get rid of samuel was first in order this was the easiest possible matter for there was not a wealthy family on the visiting list of the cammacks who would not even at some sacrifice make a place for him in their service through the close intimacy of mrs cammack and mrs slidell the latter was given the refusal and samuel told to go around and see his future mistress to her he expressed a desire to serve in her employ but he was now determined more than ever that his next master should be himself accordingly he proceeded directly to a friend from whom he purchased a set of freepapers which had been made out and sold him by a white man these required that he should start immediately up the river but upon a full consideration of the matter he decided that the risks were too great in that direction the problem was a serious one an error of judgment a step in the wrong direction would not only be a serious if not fatal blow to his hopes but might lead to untold hardships to others most dear to him somewhat irresolutely he turned his steps towards the river front gazing with longing eyes at the stretch of water the many ships in harbor some entering others steaming away or being towed out to open water the thought that in this direction beyond the wide seas lay his refuge and ultimate hope came to him with so much force as to cause him to reel like one on whom a severe blow had been dealt he stood for some time seemingly bewildered in the din and noise of the wharf noting abstractedly the many bales of cotton as truck after truckload was rushed aboard an outward bound steamer the bales seemed to fascinate him completely a stevedore yelled at him to move out of the way and aroused him into action but in that interval an idea which seemed to offer a possible means of escape had been evolved he would impersonate a merchant from the west indies in search of a missing bale of goods and endeavor to get passage to the islands where he well knew the flag of free england was abundant guarantee for his protection the main thought seemed a happy one for he soon found a merchantman that was to clear that night for jamaica it was not a passenger vessel but the captain a goodnatured briton said that he had an extra bunk in the cabin and if the gentleman did not mind roughing it he would be glad to have his company the first step towards his freedom was successfully taken the money paid down for the passage and with the injunction from the captain to be aboard by nine oclock he returned ashore only a few hours now remained to him before a long perhaps a lasting separation from his dear wife and baby and thinking to pass these with them he hurried thence by the most unfrequented route but had hardly crossed the threshold when delia weeping bitterly implored him to make good his escape as master tom had already sent the officers to look for him with a last fond embrace and a tear which falling upon that cradled babe meant present sorrow but no less future hope the husband and father made his way under the friendly shadows of the night back to the waiting ship when the officer from the custom house came aboard to inspect the ships papers samuel was resting apparently without concern in the upper bunk of the little cabin the captain seated himself at the center table opposite the officer and spread the papers before him heigho i see you have a passenger this trip and then read from the sheet samuel edmondson jamaica wi thirty years old general merchant yes said the captain as he concluded mr edmondson asked for passage at the last moment and as he was alone and we had a bunk not in service i thought id take him along he has a valuable bale of goods astray probably at jamaica and is anxious to return and look it up well i hope he may find it where is he lets have a look at him mr edmondson will you come this way a moment called the captain as may be imagined the subject of this conversation had been listening intently and now when it was demanded that he present himself he murmured a fervent god help me and jumped nimbly to the deck this is my passenger said the captain and to samuel he said the customs officer simply wished to see you mr edmondson samuel bowed and stood at ease resting one hand upon the table and in this attitude without the quiver of an eyelash or the flinching of a muscle bore the searching look of the officer which rested first upon his face and then upon his hand the flush of excitement still mounting his cheek and brow gave a bronzed swarthiness and decidedly unamerican cast to his rich brown color while his features cleancut and but slightly of the negro type with hands well shaped and nails quite clean were a combination of conditions rarely met in the average slave the first glance of suspicion was almost immediately lost to view in the smile of friendly greeting with which the officers hand was extended i hope you may recover your goods were the words he said and rising added i must be off the captain had meanwhile placed his liquor chest on the table and in a glass of good old jamaica rum a hearty bon voyage and responsive good wishes were exchanged the subsequent story of samuel interesting and adventurous as it is scarcely comes within the scope of the purpose of this article after a brief stay at jamaica samuel sailed before the mast on an english schooner carrying a cargo of dyewood to liverpool two years were passed here in the service of a wealthy merchant whom he had served while a guest of his former master in new orleans during the third year he was joined by his wife and boy who had been liberated by their mistress subsequently the family took passage for australia under the protection of a relative of his liverpool employer who was returning to extensive mining and sheepraising interests near the rapidly growing city of melbourne13 john h paynter am the edmonsons descendants of paul and amelia edmondson children grandchildren g grandchildren

union april 14 1848 2 daniel drayton was a native of new jersey who had spent several years following the water he had risen from cook to captain in the woodcarrying business from the maurice river to philadelphia eventually he engaged in coast traffic from philadelphia southward he seemed to have drifted quite naturally from strong humane impulses intensified by an oldtime spiritual conversion into a settled conviction that the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man was a reality and that it was his duty to do what he could to assist those in bondage latterly his voyages had carried him into the chesapeake bay and thence up the potomac his first successful effort to assist the slaves was made on an earlier trip when he agreed to take away a woman and five children the husband was already a free man the woman had under an agreement with her master more than paid for her liberty but when she had asked for a settlement he had only answered by threatening to sell her the mother and five children were taken aboard at night and after ten days were safely delivered at frenchtown where the husband was in waiting for them memoir of daniel drayton congressional library 3 the only punishment meted out to judson diggs for his act of betrayal so far as is known was that by a party of young men who shortly after the occurrence took him from his cart and after considerable rough handling threw him into the little stream that in those days and indeed for many years thereafter took its way along the north side of the old john wesley church then located at a spot directly opposite the north corner of the convent of the sacred heart on connecticut avenue between l and m streets a number of old citizens now living distinctly remember judson diggs who lived despised and avoided until late in the sixties one of these is mr jerome a johnson of the treasury department 4 memoir of daniel drayton congressional library 5 the case against drayton and sayres was prosecuted by philip barton key the district attorney before judge crawford and on appeal the prisoners were sentenced to pay a fine of 10000 and to remain in jail until the same should be paid english was

fame of the edmondson children through the incident of the pearl was now wide indeed and after the brooklyn meeting there had been made many suggestions looking to their education and further benefit the movement for the education of emily and mary was crystallized into a definite proposition and they were both placed in a private school a short distance out of new york miss myrtilla miner had

of the children however were not yet entirely relieved of the fears that had so long haunted them for there were still the two youngest children louisa and joseph whom the good mother frequently alluded to as the last two drops of blood in her heart and although she had scarcely ever seen a railroad train she determined to go to new york herself to see what could be done and to thank the good people who had already brought so much of happiness to herself and family while the mother was in that city the girls were brought to see her and in later years she often delighted to tell of their happy meeting and of the good white folks who were brought together to hear her story she returned to washington at the end of a week carrying the assurance that the money would be provided for the redemption of the last two of her children mrs louisa joy the last of the edmondson children died only a short while ago 13 notethis personal narrative of samuel edmondson was related by himself at his home in anacostia where he died several years ago lorenzo dow1 this is the record of a remarkable and eccentric white man who devoted himself to a life of singular labor and selfdenial in any consideration of the south one could not avoid giving at least passing notice to lorenzo dow as the foremost itinerant preacher of his time as the first protestant who expounded the gospel in alabama and mississippi and as a reformer who at the very moment when cotton was beginning to be supreme presumed to tell the south that slavery was wrong he arrests attentionthis gaunt restless preacher with his long hair his flowing beard his harsh voice and his wild gesticulation he was so rude and unkempt as to startle all conservative hearers said one of his opponents his manners are clownish in the extreme his habit and appearance more filthy than a savage indian his public discourses a mere rhapsody the substance often an insult upon the gospel said another as to his preaching in richmond mr dows clownish manners his heterodox and schismatic proceedings and his reflections against the methodist episcopal church in a late production of his on church government are impositions on common sense and furnish the principal reasons why he will be discountenanced by the methodists but he was made in the mould of heroes in his lifetime he traveled not less than two hundred thousand miles preaching to more people than any other man of his time he went from new england to the extremities of the union in the west again and again several times he went to canada once to the west indies and three times to england everywhere drawing great crowds about him friend of the oppressed he knew no path but that of duty evangel to the pioneer he again and again left the haunts of men to seek the western wilderness conversant with the scriptures intolerant of wrong witty and brilliant he assembled his hearers by the thousands what can account for so unusual a character what were the motives that prompted this man to so extraordinary and laborious a life lorenzo dow was born october 16 1777 in coventry tolland county connecticut when not yet four years old he tells us one day while at play he suddenly fell into a muse about god and those places called heaven and hell once he killed a bird and was horrified for days at the act later he won a lottery prize of nine shillings and experienced untold remorse an illness at the age of twelve gave him the shortness of breath from which he suffered more and more throughout his life about this time he dreamed that the prophet nathan came to him and told him that he would live only until he was twoandtwenty when thirteen he had another dream this time of an old man john wesley who showed to him the beauties of heaven and held out the promise that he would win if he was faithful to the end a few years afterwards came to the town hope hull preaching this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners and lorenzo said i thought he told me all that ever i did the next day the future evangelist was converted but he was to be no ordinary christian this lorenzo not satisfied with his early baptism he had the ceremony repeated and with twelve others formed a society for mutual watch and helpfulness at the age of eighteen he had still another dream this time seeing a brittle thread in the air suspended by a voice saying woe unto you if you preach not the gospel then wesley himself appeared again to him in a dream and warned him to set out at once upon his mission the young candidate applied to the connecticut conference of the methodist church he met with a reception that would have daunted any man less courageous he best tells the story himself my brethren sent me home warren and greenwich circuits in rhode island were the first of my career i obeyed but with a sorrowful heart went out a second time to new hampshire but sent home again i obeyed afterwards went to conference by directionwho rejected me and sent me home again and again i obeyed was taken out by pw on to orange circuit but in 1797 was sent home again so in obedience to man i went home a fourth time as a matter of fact there was much in the argument of the church against lorenzo dow at this time the young preacher was not only ungraceful and ungracious in manner but he had severe limitations in education and frequently assumed toward his elders an air needlessly arrogant and contemptuous on the other hand he must reasonably have been offended by the advice so frequently given him in gratuitous and patronizing fashion soon after the last rebuff just recorded however he says on going out on the granville circuit the lord gave me souls for my hire again making application to the conference he was admitted on trial for the first time in 1798 and sent to canada to break fresh ground he was not satisfied with the unpromising field and wrote my mind was drawn to the water and ireland was on my mind his great desire was to preach the gospel to the roman catholics beyond the sea accordingly on his twentysecond birthday acting solely on his own resources the venturesome evangelist embarked at montreal for dublin here he had printed three thousand handbills to warn the people of the wrath to come he attracted some attention but soon caught the smallpox and was forced to return home back in america he communicated to the conference his desire to travel the country at large the church not at all impressed in his favor by his going to ireland on his own accord would do nothing more than admit him to his old status of being on trial with appointment to the dutchess columbia and litchfield circuits depressed dow gave up the work and desiring a warmer climate he turned his face toward the south from this time forth while he constantly exhibited a willingness to meet the church half way he consistently acted with all possible independence and the church as resolutely set its face against him dow landed in savannah in january 1802 this was his first visit to the region that was to mean so much to him and in whose history he himself was to play so interesting a rle he walked on foot for hundreds of miles in georgia and south carolina everywhere preaching the gospel to all classes alike returning to the north he found that once more he could not come to terms with his conference he went back to the south going now by land for the first time he went as far as mississippi then the wild southwestern frontier and penetrated far into the country of indians and wolves returning in 1804 he became one of the first evangelists to cultivate the campmeeting as an institution in central virginia then he threw down the gauntlet to established methodism daring to speak in baltimore while the general conference of the church was in session there the church replied at once the new york conference passing a law definitely commanding its churches to shut their doors against him notwithstanding this opposition dow continued to work with his usual zeal about 1804 he was very busy speaking at from five hundred to eight hundred meetings a year in the year 1805 in spite of the inconveniences of those days he traveled ten thousand miles then he made ready to go again to europe everything possible was done by the regular church to embarrass him on this second visit and when he arrived in england he found the air far from cordial he did succeed in introducing his campmeetings into the country however and although the methodist conference registered the opinion that such meetings were highly improper in england dow prolonged his stay and planted seed which as we shall see was later to bear abundant fruit returning to america the evangelist set out upon one of the most memorable periods of his life journeying from new england to florida in 1807 from mississippi to new england and through the west in 1808 through louisiana in 1809 through georgia and north carolina and back to new england in 1810 spending 1811 for the most part in new england working southward to virginia in 1812 and spending 1813 and 1814 in the middle and northern states where the public mind was darkened more and more against him more than once he was forced to engage in controversy typical was the judgment of the baltimore conference in 1809 when in a matter of difference between dow and one mr s without dows having been seen opinion was given to the effect that mr s had given satisfaction to the conference some remarks of dows on church government were seized upon as the excuse for the treatment generally accorded him by the church in spite of much hostile opinion however dow seems always to have found firm friends in the state of north carolina in 1818 a paper in raleigh spoke of him as follows however his independent way of thinking and his unsparing candor of language may have offended others he has always been treated here with the respect due to his disinterested exertions and the strong powers of mind which his sermons constantly exhibit2 his hold upon the masses was remarkable no preacher so well as he understood the heart of the pioneer in a day when the jerks and falling and rolling on the ground and dancing still accompanied religious emotion he still knew how to give to his hearers whether bond or free the wholesome bread of life frequently he inspired an awe that was almost superstitious and made numerous converts sometimes he would make appointments a year beforehand and suddenly appear before a waiting congregation like an apparition at montville connecticut a thief had stolen an axe in the course of a sermon dow said that the guilty man was in the congregation and had a feather on his nose at once the right man was detected by his trying to brush away the feather on another occasion dow denounced a rich man who had recently died he was tried for slander and imprisoned in the county jail as soon as he was released he announced that he would preach about another rich man going into the pulpit at the appointed time he began to read and there was another rich man who died and here he stopped and after a breathless pause he said brethren i shall not mention the place this rich man went to for fear he has some relatives in this congregation who will sue me the effect was irresistible but dow heightened it by taking another text preaching a most dignified sermon and not again referring to the text on which he had started dow went again to england in 1818 he was not well received by the calvinists or the methodists and of course not by the episcopalians but he found that his campmeeting idea had begun twelve years before a new religious sect that of the primitive methodists commonly known as ranters the society in 1818 was several thousand strong and dow visited between thirty and forty of its chapels returning home he resumed his itineraries going in 1827 as far west as missouri in thinking of this mans work in the west we must keep constantly in mind of course the great difference made by a hundred years in charleston in 1821 he was arrested for an alleged libel against the peace and dignity of the state of south carolina his wife went north as it was not known but that he might be detained a long time but he was released on payment of a fine of one dollar in troy also he was once arrested on a false pretense at length however he rejoiced to see his enemies defeated in 1827 he wrote those who instigated the trouble for me at charleston south carolina or contributed thereto were all cut off within the space of three years except robert y hayne who was then the attorneygeneral for the state and is now the governor for the nullifiers3 the year 1833 dow spent in visiting many places in new york and in this year he made the following entry in his journal i am now in my fiftysixth year in the journey of life and enjoy better health than when but 30 or 35 years old with the exception of the callous in my breast which at times gives me great pain the dealings of god to meward have been good i have seen his delivering hand and felt the inward support of his grace by faith and hope which kept my head from sinking when the billows of affliction seemed to encompass me around and should those hints exemplified in the experience of cosmopolite be beneficial to any one give god the glory amen and amen farewell he died the following year in georgetown district of columbia and rests under a simple slab in oak hill cemetery in washington there is only one word to describe the writings of lorenzo dowmiscellanies anything whatsoever that came to the evangelists mind was set down not always with good form though frequently with witty and forceful expression here are hints to the public or thoughts on the fulfilment of prophecy in 1811 a journey from babylon to jerusalem with a good deal of sophomoric discussion of natural and moral philosophy a dialogue between the curious and the singular with some discussion of religious societies and theological principles the chain of lorenzo an argument on the eternal sonship of christ omnifarious law exemplified how to curse and swear lie cheat and kill according to law reflections on the important subject of matrimony and much more of the same sort strictures on church government has already been referred to as bringing upon dow the wrath of the methodist church the general thesis of this publication regarded at the time as so sensational is that the methodist mode of church government is the most arbitrary and despotic of any in america with the possible exception of that of the shakers a cry from the wildernessintended as a timely and solemn warning to the people of the united states is in every way one of dows most characteristic works at this distance when slavery and the civil war are viewed in the perspective the mystic words of the oracle impress us as almost uncanny in the rest of the southern states the influence of these foreigners will be known and felt in its time and the seeds from the hory alliance and the decapigandi who have a hand in those grades of generals from the inquisitor to the vicar general and down image pointing hand the struggle will be dreadful the cup will be bitter and when the agony is over those who survive may see better days farewell4 a radical preacher of the gospel he could not but be moved with compassion on observing the condition of the negroes in the south during these years when denied admission to white churches because of his apparent fanaticism he often found it pleasant to move among the blacks arriving in savannah one day he was accosted by a negro who seeing that he had no place to stop inquired as to whether he would accept the hospitality of a black home he embraced this opportunity and found the people by whom he was entertained as decent as two thirds of the citizens of savannah5 when on another occasion in savannah he learned that andrew bryan the negro minister of the city had because of his preaching been whipped unmercifully and imprisoned dow preached to the congregation himself6 he moved among negroes lived with them socially distributed tracts among them preached to them the word counted them with pride among his converts and treasured in his memory his experiences among them7 as a result this liberalminded man was naturally opposed to slavery he was as outspoken a champion of freedom as lived in america in his day slavery in the south said he is an evil that calls for national reform and repentance he thought that this national scourge in this world might be antidoted before the storm gathered and burst8 as all men are created equal and independent by god of nature contended he slavery must have moral evil for its foundation seeing it violates the law of nature as established by its author ambition and avarice on the one hand thought he and social dependence upon the other affords the former an opportunity of being served at the expense of the latter and this unnatural state of things hath been exemplified in all countries and all ages of the world from time immemorial he further said pride and vain glory on the one side and degradation and oppression on the other creates on the one hand a spirit of contempt and on the other a spirit of hatred and revenge preparing them to be dissolute and qualifying them for every base and malicious work he believed that the mind of man is ever aspiring for a more exalted station the consequence is the better slaves used the more saucy and impertinent they become of course the practice must be wholly abolished or the slaves must be governed with absolute sway he had discovered that the exercise of an absolute sway over others begets an unnatural hardness which as it becomes imperious contaminates the mind of the governor while the governed becomes factious and stupefied like brute beasts which are kept under by a continual dread and hence whenever the subject is investigated the evils of despotism presents to view in all their odious forms 9 his attack on slavery however was neither so general nor universal as would be expected of such a radical he saw that there is a distinction admissible in some cases between slavery itself and the spirit of slavery a man may possess slaves by inheritance or some other way and may not have it in his power either to liberate them or to make better their circumstances being trammelled by the laws and circumstances of the countryyet whilst he feels a sincere wish to do them all the justice he can he remarked too that we have no account of jesus christ saying one word about emancipation onesimus ran away from philemon to rome whence finding paul whom he had seen at his masters he experienced religion and was sent back by the apostle with a letterbut not a word about setting him free10 contrasting then the unhappy state with that of the past he said the first and primitive christians had all things common not from commandment but from spirit by which they were influenced day by day so when the time of restitution takes place which will be long before the consummation of all things then the law of nature from moral principles will be practiced and the world will be as one concentrated family the openings to providence preparatory to that day should be attended to from principles of dutylest judgments should perform what offered mercy if not rejected may be ready to accomplish to feed and clothe another is both the interest and duty of all mastersand the sixth chapter of ephesians is an excellent tract on the subject to all who wish for advice both as masters and servants11 it was likewise in keeping with dows fearlessness to denounce the efforts to discriminate against negroes in the early churches he questioned the farreaching authority of bishop coke asbury and mckendree and accused asbury of being jealous of the rising power of richard allen founder of the african methodist church12 he refers at considerable length to the incident in a philadelphia church which ultimately made absalom jones a rector and richard allen a bishop the colored people were considered by some persons as being in the way they were resolved to have them removed and placed around the walls corners etc which to execute the above expelled and restored man at prayer time did attempt to pull absolom jones from his knees which procedure with its concomitants gave rise to the building of an african meeting house the first ever built in these middle or northern states here at least was a man with a missionthat mission to carry the gospel of christ to the uttermost parts of the earth he knew no standard but that of duty he heeded no command but that of his own soul rude and sharp of speech he was and only halfeducated but he was made of the stuff of heroes and neither hunger nor cold nor powers nor principalities nor things present nor things to come could daunt him in his task after the lapse of a hundred years he looms larger not smaller in the history of our southland and as of old we seem to hear again the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord benjamin brawley footnotes 1 very little has been written about lorenzo dow there

the free negro toward african colonization in the midst of the perplexities arising from various plans for the solution of the race problem one hundred years ago the colonization movement became all things to all men some contended that it was a philanthropic enterprise others considered it a scheme for getting rid of the free people of color because of the seeming menace they were to slavery it was doubtless a combination of several ideas1 furthermore the meaning of colonization varied on the one hand according to the use the slaveholding class hoped to make of it and on the other hand according to the intensity of the attacks directed against it by the abolitionists and the free colored people because of the acquiescent attitude of colonizationists toward the persecution of the free blacks both in the north and south2 almost as soon as the negroes had a chance to express themselves they offered urgent protest against the policy of removing them to a foreign land before the american colonization society had scarcely organized the free people of richmond virginia thought it advisable to assemble under the sanction of authority in 1817 to make public expression of their sentiments respecting this movement william bowler and lenty craw were the leading spirits of the meeting they agreed with the society that it was not only proper but would ultimately tend to benefit and aid a great portion of their suffering fellow creatures to be colonized but they preferred being settled in the remotest corner of the land of their nativity as the president and board of managers of the society had been pleased to leave it to the entire discretion of congress to provide a suitable place for carrying out this plan they passed a resolution to submit to the wisdom of that body whether it would not be an act of charity to grant them a small portion of their territory either on the missouri river or any place that might seem to them most conducive to the public good and their future welfare subject however to such rules and regulations as the government of the united states might think proper3 many negroes however emigrated from this state during later years subsequent accounts indicate too that this increasing interest in colonization among the colored people of that commonwealth extended even into north carolina4 farther north we observe more frequent and frank expressions of the attitude of the colored people toward this enterprise when the people of richmond virginia registered their mild protest against it about 3000 free blacks of philadelphia took higher ground5 because their ancestors not of their own accord were the first successful cultivators of the wilds of america they felt themselves entitled to participate in the blessings of its luxuriant soil which their blood and sweat had moistened they viewed with deep abhorrence the unmerited stigma attempted to be cast upon the reputation of the free people of color that they are a dangerous and useless part of the community when in the state of disfranchisement in which they lived in the hour of danger they ceased to remember their wrongs and rallied around the standard of their country they were determined never to separate themselves from the slave population of this country as they were brethren by the ties of consanguinity of suffering and of wrong6 they therefore appointed a committee of eleven persons to open correspondence with joseph hopkinson member of congress from that city to inform him of the sentiments of the meeting and issued an address to the humane and benevolent inhabitants of philadelphia7 disclaiming all connection with the society questioning the professed philanthropy of its promoters and pointing out how disastrous it would be to the free colored people should it be carried out8 although a few persecuted negroes of maryland from the very beginning believed it advisable to emigrate the first action of importance observed among the colored people of baltimore favoring colonization in africa was that of a series of meetings held there in 1826 the sentiment of these delegates as expressed by their resolutions was that the time had come for the colored people to express their interest in the efforts which the wise and philanthropic were making in their behalf differing from the people of richmond they felt that although residing in this country they were strangers not citizens and that because of the difference of color and servitude of most of their race they could not hope to enjoy the immunities of freemen believing that there would be left a channel through which might pass such as thereafter received their freedom they urged emigration to africa as the scheme which they believed would offer the quickest and best relief9 we have not been able to find many records which give proof that in the states far south there was much opposition of the negroes to the plan of removing the free people of color from the united states we must not conclude however that this absence of protest from the free colored people in that section of the country was due to the fact that they almost unanimously approved the plan of african colonization10 consideration must be given to the fact that the free colored people in the southern states did not exercise the privilege of free speech consequently if there were even a large minority who opposed the plan they were afraid to make their views known especially when this movement was being promoted by some of the leading white people of that section occasionally there arose among the colored people of the south advocates of colonization setting forth the advantages of emigration in all but convincing style11 such was a free man of color of savannah in the year 1832 he had always viewed the principles on which the american colonization society was grounded as one of large policy though he saw it was aided by a great deal of benevolence and when viewing his situation with those of his colored brethren of the united states he had often wondered what prevented them from rising with one accord to accept the offer made them although they might sacrifice the comforts of their present situation he had often almost come to the conclusion that he would make the sacrifice and had only been prevented by unfavorable accounts of the climate hearing that liberia needed help he desired to go he and the negroes for whom he spoke seemed to be of an enterprising kind he understood the branches of wheelwright blacksmith and carpentry and had made some progress in machinery he did not expect to go at the expense of the society and therefore hoped to take with him something more than those who had emigrated on those terms12 another such freeman spoke from charleston the same year he had observed with much regret that northern states were passing laws to get rid of the free people of color driven from the south on account of hostile legislation13 he was also fearful as to the prospects of the free blacks even in favorable southern cities like charleston where they were given a decided preference in most of the higher pursuits of labor he believed therefore that emigration to africa was the solution of their problem he urged this for the reason that the country offered them and their posterity forever protection in life liberty and property by honor of office with the gift of the people privileges of sharing in the government and finally the opportunity to become a perfectly free and independent people and a distinguished nation14 the letters of thomas s grimk written to the colonization society during these years show that other freedmen of charleston driven to the same conclusions were planning to emigrate15 conditions in that state however forced some free negroes to emigrate to foreign soil a number of free colored people left charleston and settled in certain free states after residing two or three years in the north they found out that their condition instead of improving had grown worse as they were more despised crowded out of every respectable employment and even very much less respected they therefore returned to their former home on reaching charleston however they were still dissatisfied with their condition changes which had taken place during their absence from the state made it evident that in this country they could never possess those rights and privileges which all men desire some of them resolved therefore to try their fortunes in liberia16 the negroes in alabama had also become interested in the movement during these years17 in writing to mr mclain of washington s wesley jones a colored man of tuscaloosa said that save the christian religion there was no subject of so much importance and that lay so near his heart as that of african colonization all that was necessary to change the attitude on the part of the colored people was a move by some one in whom the people have confidence to put the whole column in motion and just when there is a start made in alabama the whole body of the free people of color will join in a solid phalanx as for himself he had fully made up his mind to go to liberia but could not leave the united states until he had closed up a ten years business and if successful in collecting tolerably well what was due him he would be able to go without expense to the society18 in july 1848 this same writer addressed to mr mclain another letter in which he gave details of a trip he had made in an adjoining county in the interest of emigration to liberia during this trip he said he had found a few free colored people who after he had talked with them on the subject were of one accord that the best thing they could do for themselves was to emigrate to liberia19 in another letter addressed to mclain by the same writer december 29 1851 it was stated that the colonization movement was still growing in the state he also said that those of us who want to go to liberia are men who have been striving to do something for themselves and consequently have more or less business to close up mention was also made of the fact that there were at huntsville in the northern part of the state several who had in part made up their minds to go and only wanted a little encouragement to set them fully in favor of liberia20 although thus favorably received in the south however the colonization society met opposition in other parts the spreading of the immediate abolition doctrine by men like garrison and jay had a direct bearing on the enterprise the two movements became militantly arrayed against each other and tended to inflame the minds of the colored people throughout the country the consensus of opinion among them was that the colonization society was their worst enemy and its efforts would tend only to exterminate the free people of color and perpetuate the institution of slavery21 so general was this feeling that t h gallaudet a promoter of the colonization movement writing to one of its officers in 1831 said that something must be done to calm the feelings of the colored people in the large cities of the north22 their resentment seemed to be due not so much to the fact that they were urged to emigrate but that a large number of the promoters of the enterprise seemed to feel that the free negroes should be forced to leave23 considering themselves as much entitled to the protection of the laws of this country as any other element of its population they took the position that any free man of color who would accept the offers of the colonization movement should be branded as an enemy of his race they not only demonstrated their unalterable opposition but expressed a firm resolve to resist the colonizationists even down to death the proceedings of these meetings will throw much light on the excitement then prevailing among the free people of color in the border and northern states in 1831 a baltimore meeting led by william douglass and william watkins expressed the belief that the american colonization society was founded more upon selfish policy than in the true principles of benevolence and therefore as far as it regards the lifegiving spring of its operations that it was not entitled to their confidence and should be viewed by them with that caution and distrust which their happiness demanded they considered the land in which they had been born and bred their only true and appropriate home and declared that when they desired to remove they would apprise the public of the same in due season24 that same year a large meeting of colored people of washington in the district of columbia convened for the purpose of expressing their opinion on this important question although they knew that among the advocates of the colonizing system they had many true and sincere friends they declared that the efforts of these philanthropists though prompted no doubt by the purest motives should be viewed with distress they further asserted that as the soil which gave them birth was their only true and veritable home it would be impolitic if they should leave their home without the benefit of education25 a meeting of the very same order of the free people of color of wilmington delaware that year led by peter spencer and thomas dorsey took the position that the colonization movement was inimical to the best interests of the colored people and at variance with the principles of civil and religious liberty and wholly incompatible with the spirit of the constitution and the declaration of independence of the united states26 a meeting of free colored people held in boston massachusetts in 1831 was of the opinion that none should leave the united states but if there were or should be any expatriated in consequence of abuses from their white countrymen it was advisable to recommend them to haiti or upper canada where they would find equal laws in regard to their being sent to africa because they were natives of that land they asked how can a man be born in two countries at the same time in refutation of the argument made by the colonization society that the establishment of the colony in liberia would prevent the further operation of the slave trade they said we might as well argue that a watchman in the city of boston would prevent thievery in new york or that the custom house officers there would prevent goods being smuggled into any other port of the united states27 because there were in the united states much better lands on which a colony might be established and at a much cheaper expense to those who promoted it than could possibly be had by sending them into a howling wilderness across the seas they questioned the philanthropy of the promoters of african colonization and adopted resolutions in opposition to the movement28 a public meeting of colored citizens of new york with samuel ennals and philip bell as promoters referred to the colonizationists as men of mistaken views with respect to the welfare and wishes of the colored people the meeting solemnly protested against the bold effort to colonize the oppressed free people of color on the ground that it was unjust illiberal and unfounded tending to excite prejudice of the community29 at a meeting of the free colored people of brooklyn promoted by henry c thompson and george hogarth it was resolved that they knew of no other country in which they could justly claim or demand their rights as citizens whether civil or political but in the united states of america their native soil and that they would be active in their endeavors to convince the members of the colonization society and the public generally that being men brethren and fellow citizens they were like other citizens entitled to an equal share of protection from the federal government30 the sentiment of a meeting at hartford connecticut in 1831 was that the american colonization society was actuated by the same motives which influenced the mind of pharaoh when he ordered the male children of the israelites to be destroyed they believed that the society was the greatest of all foes to the free colored people and slave population and that the man of color who would emigrate to liberia was an enemy to the cause and a traitor to his brethren as they had committed no crime worthy of banishment they would resist all attempts of the colonization society to banish them from their native land31 a new haven meeting of the peace and benevolent society of africamericans led by henry berrian and henry n merriman expressed interest in seeing africa become civilized and religiously instructed but not by the absurd and invidious plan of the colonization society to send a nation of ignorant men to teach a nation of ignorant men they would therefore resist all attempts for their removal to the torrid shores of africa and would sooner suffer every drop of their blood to be taken from their veins than submit to such unrighteous treatment from the colored people of lyme connecticut came the sincere opinion that the colonization society was one of the wildest projects ever patronized by enlightened men the colored citizens of middletown chief among whom were joseph gilbert and amos g beman inquired why should we leave this land so dearly bought by the blood groans and tears of our fathers truly this is our home said they here let us live and here let us die32 the meeting in columbia pennsylvania the leaders of which were stephen smith and james richard expressed the opinion that african colonization was a scheme of the southern planters and wicked device of slaveholders who were desirous of riveting more firmly and perpetuating more certainly the fetters of slavery by ridding themselves of a population whose presence influence and example had a tendency as they supposed to produce discontent among the slaves and to furnish them with inducements to rebellion33 a few weeks later a meeting was held at pittsburgh under the leadership of j b vashon and r bryan the colored people of this city styled themselves as brethren and countrymen as much entitled to the free exercise of the elective franchise as any other inhabitants and demanded an equal share of protection from the federal government they informed the colonization society that should their reason forsake them then might they desire to remove they would apprise them of that change in due season as citizens of the united states they mutually pledged to each other their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor not to support a colony in africa nor upper canada nor yet emigrate to haiti here they were bornhere they would live by the help of the almighty godand here they would die34 early in 1832 the colored people of lewiston pennsylvania in a meeting called by samuel and martin johnston expressed practically the same sentiments35 through the influence of jacob d richardson and jacob g williams an indignation meeting of the same kind was held at harrisburg36 the free people of color assembled at nantucket rhode island in 1831 under the leadership of arthur cooper and edward j pompey saw no philanthropy in the colonization movement but discovered in it a scheme gotten up to delude them from their native land into a country of sickness and death37 a trenton meeting promoted by lewis cork and abner h francis viewed the american colonization society as the most inveterate foe both to the free and slave man of color these memorialists disclaimed all union with the society and once for all declared that they would never remove under its patronage either to africa or elsewhere38 in new york there had been various expressions pro and con as to emigration to liberia but it does not seem that a large number of colored people of that city ever favored it they believed rather in emigration to canada the attitude of the people of that state was shown in 1834 by the troubles of reverend peter williams rector of st phillips church in the city of new york working through the phoenix society and the antislavery society he had endeavored to convince the free colored people that the idea held out to men of color that no matter how they might strive to become intelligent virtuous and useful they could never enjoy the privilege of citizens in the united states was erroneous on the contrary he believed that the declaration of independence which his father had helped to maintain and the gospel of jesus christ had sufficient power to raise the people of color at some time to the rank of citizenship although his opposition never extended further than the expression of his views there arose so much antagonism to him that he was asked by his bishop to resign from the antislavery society because of a disturbance in his church39 there remained others however to continue the attack at a meeting in 1839 the free people of color of new york entered a unanimous protest against the efforts of this body reiterating the sentiment that the american colonization society was the source from which came the various proscriptions and oppressions under which they groaned40 the attitude of the free blacks of new york was probably better demonstrated on the occasion of the appearance of w s ball who had been sent to liberia by the free colored people of illinois to secure definite information concerning the advisability of emigrating to africa on his return to new york he made a speech to a large assembly of colored people some of whom desiring to see liberia for themselves had made preparations for a company to sail september 1848 ball expressed himself as well pleased with the country and after interesting the colored people of illinois40a he hoped to return to liberia with a large emigration the colored people of new york received him in good faith while the liberian commissioners were in session president roberts and his comrades were invited to come to the anthony street church to inform them of the country after several speeches had been made opportunity was given to the colored people to ask questions that had not been touched upon this continued for some time and seemed to elicit information highly favorable to the cause until a mr morrill made his way up the aisle toward the platform after having gained the attention of the audience with an air of superiority which showed he was accustomed to control audiences of colored people he said that he had just come into town and was surprised to find his friends engaged in holding a colonization meeting that question said he has been settled long ago and the liberia humbug at this point the hisses were so loud he could not be heard finally after much yelling and shouting of hear him the meeting became a bedlam and the presiding officer attempted to leave the chair finding order impossible the meeting was adjourned in an uproar amid cries of a fight a fight women leaped over the pews and made their way to the doors after some time had elapsed order was restored by clearing the house but morrill who seemingly had come with the expressed purpose of breaking up the meeting was not found in the chaos that ensued41 doubtless the best expression of antagonism to the american colonization society came from the annual convention of the free colored people held first in 1830 and almost annually thereafter in philadelphia and other northern cities almost until the civil war the second annual convention showed an attitude of militant opposition by emphatically protesting against any appropriation by congress in behalf of the movement the third annual convention which met in philadelphia in 1833 probably represented the high water mark of their antagonism to this enterprise there were 59 representatives of the free people of color from eight different states namely pennsylvania maryland new jersey delaware rhode island new york connecticut and massachusetts the leaders of the movement were james forten robert douglas joseph cassey robert purvis and james mccrummell at an early stage in the proceedings of this convention there prevailed a motion that a committee consisting of one delegate from each of the states represented in the convention be appointed to draft resolutions expressive of the sentiments of the people of color in regard to the subject of colonization although these men were opposed to emigration to africa they favored a sort of colonization in some part of america for the relief of such persons as might leave the united states on account of oppressive laws like those of ohio42 the colored people would in this case give such refugees all aid in their power after having divested themselves of all unreasonable prejudice and reviewed the whole ground of their opposition to the american colonization society with all the candor of which they were capable they still declared to the world that they were unable to arrive at any other conclusion than that the lifegiving principles of the society were totally repugnant to the spirit of true benevolence that the doctrines which the society inculcated were hostile to those of their holy religion and in direct violation of the golden rule and that the inevitable tendency of this doctrine was to strengthen the cruel prejudice of their opponents to still the heart of sympathy to the appeals of suffering negroes and retard their advancement in morals literature and science in short to extinguish the last glimmer of hope and throw an impenetrable gloom over their fears and most reasonable prospects all plans for actual colonization therefore were rejected43 the movement thereafter continued to receive the attention of the people in the various parts of the country being generally denounced the negroes of ohio were prominent among those who opposed it44 invited to hear a lecture by mr pinney a former governor of liberia then on a tour in the united states raising funds to purchase land there the free blacks of cincinnati held a meeting to protest arrogating to themselves the privilege of expressing the opinion of all the colored people of the united states they respectfully declined the invitation for the reasons that the scheme was iniquitous in that it implied the assumption of the inequality of the free people of color45 they accordingly urged that such sums as their socalled friends might give for the purchase of land in africa might be used for establishing schools and asylums for colored children in this country46 at a series of meetings of free colored people held in the city of cleveland ohio during the winter of 184546 the colonization society was denounced as an organization whose proceedings tended to aggravate the injustice with which the free colored people were treated in this country it was called the greatest antagonist which colored people had to meet and put down before they could stand erect in this country during the meeting a very bitter spirit was shown toward the white race they passed resolutions declaring that the colored people were entitled to all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the whites and pledged themselves never to rest until they had redressed their wrongs and gained their rights47 another important instance of the opposition of the colored people of the north and west may be observed in the proceedings of a meeting held in cincinnati mr vashon a free man of color of pittsburgh had a motion passed in one of their antislavery meetings in that city declaring the colonization society inimical to the best interests of the free colored population of the country and unworthy of the support of the churches after speeches had been made by vashon and henry gloster a free man of color from michigan the original motion was passed with but one or two dissenting voices in spite of the efforts to amend it it is probable that the amendments proposed were to soften the tone of the original motion but no mention was made of them other than to state that they were offered by the opposition48 numerous other meetings were held to continue the expression of the same sentiments at a meeting in boston in 1847 the colonization society was referred to as the expatriating institution which would never be able to expel americans by birth pledged never to leave their native land49 a state convention of colored people of new york held during three days in the capital at albany 1851 unanimously expressed their pleasure at the failure of the colonization society of that state to obtain an appropriation from the legislature50 at another meeting at albany in 1852 reverend j w c pennington and dr j mccune smith were instrumental in inducing the meeting to adopt an able refutation of governor hunts views in favor of a similar appropriation51 another state convention of colored people of ohio convened in cincinnati unconditionally condemned the society because its policy of expatriating the free colored people was merely to render slave property more secure and valuable52 john m langston was the chairman of this meeting other such meetings held in rochester new york and new bedford massachusetts about the same time expressed similar sentiments53 on the occasion of the formation of a county colonization society as a result of a visit of jb pinney to syracuse resolutions expressing deep regret that the influence of the society had extended to that section54 were unanimously passed at another meeting at providence the same year the colonization society was denounced because of the plea that its motive in promoting emigration to africa was to christianize the heathen55 a series of meetings were held in ohio to oppose the efforts of colonization agents56 a columbus meeting of 1849 considered such workers inveterate enemies another meeting in the same place in 1851 referred to one of their memorials as containing the false statement that the colored people of ohio were prepared to go to liberia they considered n l rice and david christy promoters of the colonization scheme in that state avowed friends of slavery and slaveholders57 in a subsequent state convention in 1853 they urged every free black to use his influence against any bill offered in any state or national legislature to appropriate money for this enterprise58 when cushings bill to facilitate colonization was offered the free people of cincinnati ohio held an indignation meeting in 1853 to organize their friends to prevent its passage59 the most distinguished negroes of the country too were using the rostrum and the press to impede the progress of the american colonization society prominent among these protagonists were samuel e cornish and theodore s wright who without doubt voiced the sentiments of the majority of the free colored people in the north these leaders took occasion in 1840 to attack theodore frelinghuysen and benjamin butler who had been reported as saying that the colonization project had been received with delight by the colored people60 answering this assertion they maintained that if it was said of southern slavesif it had been asserted that they yearned for africa or indeed any part of the world even more unhospitable and unhappy where they might be free from their masters there probably would have been no one to dissent from that opinion but to prove that this was not the situation among the free people of color these spokesmen related numerous facts showing that in various conventions from year to year the free blacks had protested against emigration to africa61 the greatest enemy of the colonization society among the freedmen however was yet to appear this was frederick douglass at the national convention of free people of color held at rochester new york in 1853 he was called upon to write the address to the colored people of the united states a significant expression in this address was we ask that no appropriation whatever state or national be granted to the colonization scheme we would have our right to leave or remain in the united states placed above legislative interference62 he had already gone on record in writing to mrs harriet beecher stowe in reply to her inquiry as to the best thing to be done for the elevation of the colored people evidently the society said he looks upon our extremity as their opportunity and whenever the elements are started against us they are stimulated to immeasurable activity they do not deplore our misfortunes but rather rejoice in them63 he referred to the society as the twin sister of slavery still at her post fostering prejudice against the colored man and scattering abroad her hateful unphilosophical dogmas as to the inferiority of the negro and the necessity of his expatriation for his elevation and that of his white country men the truth is said he we are here and here we are likely to remain individuals emigrate nations never we have grown up with this republic and i see nothing in her character or find in the character of the american people as yet which compels the belief that we must leave the united states64 all the free persons of color however did not continue to think on this wise after the ebullitions of sentiment had ceased a few negroes began to think that emigration was not an unmixed evil they were driven to this position in various ways some desired to flee from increasing persecution then afflicting free negroes both in the north and in the south others were won over by such inducements for commercial advancement as a pacification of yoruba seemed to offer in opening up the soudan and not a few like alexander crummell65 and daniel a payne who although opposed to the expatriation of their race favored colonization so far as it would redeem africa even frederick douglass in answering the charge that the free people of color had been prejudiced against efforts to redeem africa stated that they were very much in favor of such a work but objected to the efforts of the colonization society because of its defect of good motives66 a number of negroes yielded also to the logic of the colonizationists who in trying to disabuse their minds of the thought that it would be a disgrace to leave this country as exiles held up to them the example of the pilgrim fathers who left their native land to obtain political and religious liberty furthermore some negroes like martin r delaney who had at first fearlessly opposed the colonization of the blacks in africa began during the fifties to promote the emigration of the free people of color to other parts many of this persuasion went to canada west and some few to trinidad67 although antagonism to african colonization was pronounced in the northern free states there were several intelligent colored men who were strongly in favor of it it was said however that such negroes had usually been educated or aided in some way by the american colonization society one of this class of spokesmen was george baltimore of whitehall in reading in the national watchman a notice for a call for a national convention of colored people to be held in troy in 1847 he availed himself of the opportunity to speak for the colonization society referring to the suggestions set forth in the call the writer said that he could adopt all of them excepting the one to recommend emigration and colonization not of africa asia or europe he considered this a fling at the american colonization society and those people of color who were desirous of going to their fatherland68 another spokesman of this order was alphonso m sumner of philadelphia personally he was in favor of emigrating from the united states and was of the opinion that at that time at least colonization in liberia offered the only tangible means of attaining their wishes he believed that the abolition of the slave trade could be attained in no other way but like most colored men in the free states favoring colonization he was desirous of knowing something about the land before emigrating thereto69 writing from hartford in 1851 augustus washington stated that he was well aware that there could be nothing more startling than that a northern colored man considered intelligent and sound in faith should declare his opinion and use his influence in favor of african colonization he maintained however that the novelty of the thing did not prove it false any more than it would be to say that because one breaks away from a longestablished custom he may not have the least reason for doing so he urged the free colored people to emigrate from the crowded cities to less populous parts of the united states to the great west or to africa or to any place where they might secure an equality of rights and liberties with a mind unfettered and space in which to rise moreover from the time he was a lad of fifteen years of age and especially since the mexican war he had advocated the plan of a separate state for the colored people70 in a letter addressed to the editor of the african repository in 1853 nathaniel bowen undertook to express similar views although they possessed only partial freedom in this country the free colored people of his city rome new york were generally against colonization moreover he found many colored people who talked of and favored going to canada but he believed if those persons would take their interests into consideration they would not hesitate to go to africa71 the efforts toward emigration too took organized form during the forties and fifties in 1848 the free colored people of dayton ohio held a meeting to express their sentiments in favor of emigration to africa and to ask the white citizens to aid them in going there72 the movement also reached the colored people of cincinnati ohio73 at a meeting held in that city on the 14th of july 1850 they adopted a preamble and resolutions expressing similar sentiments going a step further in 1850 a number of free negroes of new york formed an organization called the new york and liberian agricultural and emigration society to coperate with the colonization society considerable money was collected by the organization to aid emigrants whom they sent to liberia74 in july 1852 there was held in baltimore a meeting of delegates from the city and different sections of the state of maryland after heated discussion and much excitement they passed resolutions to examine the different foreign localities for emigration giving preference to liberia it seemed that although a majority of the delegates present desired to coperate with the american colonization society they were afraid to do so because of the opposition of the baltimore people who in a state of excitement almost developed into a mob intent upon breaking up the meeting75 as this meeting of delegates from the whole state seemed to be favorable to the colonization enterprise the people of baltimore felt it incumbent upon them to hold another meeting a few days thereafter maintaining that they did not know that a previous meeting was called for the consideration of the questions brought before it and denounced it as being unrepresentative they said that they were not opposed to voluntary emigration but did not at any time elect delegates to the socalled colored colonization convention76 to carry out more effectively the work of ameliorating the condition of the colored people a national council composed of two members chosen by election at a poll in each state was organized in 1853 as many as twenty state conventions were to be represented before these plans could be well matured however those who believed that emigration was the only solution of the race problem called another convention to consider merely that question only those who would not introduce the question of african emigration but favored colonization in some other parts were invited among the persons thus interested were reverend william webb and martin r delaney of pittsburgh doctor j gould bias and franklin turner of philadelphia reverend augustus r greene of allegheny pennsylvania james m whitfield of new york william lambert of michigan henry bibb james theodore holly of canada and henry m collins of california77 frederick douglass criticised this step as uncalled for unwise unfortunate and premature a convention to consider the subject of emigration said he when every delegate must declare himself in favor of it before hand as a condition of taking his seat is like the handle of the jug all on one side78 james m whitfield the negro poet of america came to the defense of his coworkers he and douglass continuing the literary duel for a number of weeks the convention was accordingly held in it there appeared three parties one led by doctor delaney who desired to go to the niger valley in africa another by whitfield whose interests seemed to be in central america and a third by holly who showed a preference for haiti the leaders of these respective parties were commissioned to go to these various countries to do what they could in carrying out their schemes79 holly went to haiti and took up with the minister of the interior the question of admitting negro emigrants from the united states80 among the colored people of the northwest there appeared evidence of considerable interest in emigration this was especially true of illinois and indiana from which commissioners had been sent out to spy the land81 this is evidenced too by the sentiment expressed by delegates attending the cleveland convention in 1854 the next emigration convention was held at chatham canada west in 1856 one of the important features of this meeting was the hearing the report of holly who went to haiti the previous year from this same meeting martin r delaney proceeded on his mission to the niger valley in africa there he concluded a treaty with eight african kings offering inducements to negroes to emigrate in the meantime james redpath had gone to haiti and accomplished some things that holly failed to achieve he was appointed haitian commissioner of emigration in the united states with holly as his coworker they succeeded in sending to haiti as many as two thousand emigrants the first sailing in 1861 owing to their unpreparedness and the unfavorable climate not more than one third of them remained82 considering the facts herein set forth we are compelled to say that the colonization movement was a failure although it did finally interest a number of free negroes their concern in it did not materialize on account of the outbreak of the civil war occurring soon thereafter on the whole the movement never appealed to a large number of intelligent free people of color with the exception of those who hoped to be especially benefited thereby few leading negroes dared to support the enterprise the most weighty evidence we can offer is statistics themselves the report of the colonization society shows that from 1820 to 1833 83 only 2885 colored persons had been sent out by the society more than 2700 of this number were taken from the slave states and about two thirds of these were slaves manumitted on the condition of their emigrating of the 783684 sent out of the united states up to 1852 2720 were born free 204 purchased their freedom 3868 were emancipated in view of removing them to liberia and 1044 were liberated africans sent out by the united states government when we consider the fact that there were 43449585 free persons of color in the united states in 1850 and 488070 in 1860 this element of the population had not been materially

prosperous country assures to all its inhabitants enjoying the rich blessings of religion by opportunities of worshipping the only true god under the light of christianity each of us according to his understanding and having afforded us and our children the means of education and improvement we have no wish to separate from our present homes for any purpose whatever contented with our present situation and condition we are desirous of increasing the prosperity by honest efforts and by the use of the opportunities for their improvement which the constitution and laws allow we therefore a portion of those who are the objects of this plan and among those whose benefits with them of others of color it is intended to promote with humble and grateful acknowledgments to those who have devised it renounce and disclaim every connection with it and respectfully and firmly declare our determination not to participate in any part of it nor do we view the colonization of those who may become emancipated by its operation among our southern brethren as capable to produce their happiness unprepared by education and a knowledge of the principles of our blessed religion for their new situation those who will thus become colonized will thus be surrounded by every suffering which can affect the members of the human family without arts without habits of industry and unaccustomed to provide by their own exertions and foresight for their wants the colony will soon become the abode of every vice and the home of every misery soon will the light of christianity which now dawns among that portion of our species be cut out by the clouds of ignorance and their day of life be closed without the illumination of the gospel to those of our brethren who shall be left behind there will be assured perpetual slavery and augmented sufferings diminished in numbers the slave population of the southern states which by their magnitude alarms its proprietors will be easily secured those who among their bondsmen who feel that they should be free by right which all mankind have from god and from nature will be sent to the colony and the timid and submissive will be retained and subjected to increasing rigor year after year will witness those means to assure safety and submission among their slaves and the southern masters will colonize only those who it may be dangerous to keep among them the bondage of a large portion of our members will thus be rendered perpetual disclaiming as we emphatically do a wish or desire to interpose our opinions and feelings between the plan of colonization and the judgment of those whose wisdom as far as exceeds ours as their situations are exalted above ours we humbly respectfully and fervently intreat and beseech your disapprobation of the plan of colonization now offered by the american society for colonizing the free people of color of the united states here in the city of philadelphia where the voice of the suffering sons of africa was first heard where was first commenced the work of abolition on which heaven has smiled for it could have had success only from the great maker will not a purpose be assisted which will state the cause of the entire abolition of slavery in the united states and which may defeat it altogether which proffers to those who do not ask for them what it calls benefits but which they

free negroes in the historical collections of ohio howe says in the county brown there are two large settlements of colored persons numbering about 500 each one of these is 3 miles north of georgetown the other is in the ne part of the county about 16 miles distant they emigrated from virginia in the year 1818 and were originally the slaves of samuel gist who manumitted and settled them here upon two large surveys of land their situation unfortunately is not prosperoushowe historical collections of ohio 71 referring to these settlements some years later another historian said the colored settlement in eagle township was made in 1818 by a number of the former slaves of samuel gist a wealthy banker resident of london england and an extensive landowner and slaveholder in the united states it is not known that gist ever visited his plantation here or that he ever saw a single slave that cultivated his lands but all was left to the management of resident agents appointed by him these lands lay in the counties of hanover amherst goslin goochland and henrico va and included some of the first plantations in the old dominion in 1808 desiring to make ample provision for the future of those who had so abundantly filled his coffers by their servitude gist made a will the intent of which was certainly benevolent but which has been most wretchedly executed this document of fiftyeight closely written pages is a study within itself it begins thus this is the last will and testament of me samuel gist of gower street in the parish of st giles in the city of london of the county of middlesex england after bequeathing various valuable estates large sums of money to his only daughter he designated what property and sums of money shall fall to the numerous persons who have been in his employ and most explicitly does he provide for his slaves in virginia who numbered nearly one thousand souls relative to them the will provides that at his death his slaves in virginia shall be free that his lands shall be sold and comfortable homes in a free state be purchased for them with the proceeds that the revenue from his plantations the last year of his life be applied in building school houses and churches for their accommodation that all money coming to him in virginia be set aside for the employment of ministers and teachers to instruct them that care be taken to make them as comfortable and happy as possible in 1815 samuel gist died and wickham of richmond va in conjunction with his fatherinlaw page who had been appointed gists agent proceeded to execute his will accordingly through parties in hillsboro ohio 1112 acres of land near georgetown and 1200 acres west of fincastle in eagle township were purchased for homes for these slaves these lands were covered with thickets of undergrowth and sloughs of stagnant water and were almost valueless at that time for any purpose other than pasturage here in june 1818 came nearly 900 persons a part of whom located on the georgetown lands the remainder on the fincastle purchase their comfortable homes lay in the wild region about them the education they received was in the stern school of adversity as a matter of course they did not prosper some who were able returned to virginia others built rude huts and began clearing away the forest what little money they had was soon spent scheming white men planned to get their personal property they became involved in numerous law suits among themselves and so from various causes they were reduced almost to pauperism in later years their lands have been sold so that at present but few families remain as relics of this once large settlement among the first families that settled in this township were the following most of whom had families jacob cumberland george cumberland samuel hudson gabriel york james gist gabriel johnson joseph locust james cluff davis sol garrison pearsons williams glascow ellis and tom fox old sam hudson as he was familiarly known was an odd character and many anecdotes are yet related of him at one time he was sent to the state prison at columbus for making unlawful use of another mans horse and so it happened that a white man named demitt accompanied him for a like offense upon being interrogated as to his occupation sam answered preacher ob de gospel turning to demitt the officer asked whats your occupation i clerk for sam was the shrewd reply richmond cumberland blind dick meredith cumberland taylor davis moses cumberland ephraim johnson and winston cumberland were also born in virginiahistory of brown county ohio edition 1883 p 592 during these years according to the letter below another group of negroes found their way into jefferson county ohio dear sir every body with whom i have talked about this colony of negroes referred me to judge mansfield as one knowing more about it than anybody else he therefore is my chief informer in 1825 a colony of slaves was sent up from charles city county virginia to smithfield in jefferson county ohio about twenty miles southwest of steubenville they were the slaves of thomas beaufort of the virginia county above named so far as i could learn not all of beauforts slaves were sent to smithfield another colony i was told was located at stillwater in harrison county ohio but i have not yet been in that community how the slaves traveled from virginia to smithfield could not be told the number sent up is not knownabout thirty or forty families they said they were a tribe as it were nattie beaufort being the patriarch they were sent in charge of a man named mcintyre an overseer who supposedly had been sent to see to the locating of the slaves on a tract of land which the master had bought for them through benjamin ladd a quaker of the smithfield community mcintyre returned to virginia after a few days stay he was never in the community again nor was any other representative of the beauforts so far as anybody knows the land was bought in wayne townshipabout 200 acres about five miles out from smithfield it is quite rolling of stiff clay character there are fine farms all about it and coal fields not far away it was bought of thomas mansfield whose son a prominent lawyer in steubenville still owns land contiguous to the beaufort tract and owns now a part of what his father sold the slaves according to judge mansfield the tract of land was laid out in fiveacre plots a cabin was built on each and a family placed in each cabin the families were the married sons and daughters of nathaniel beaufort who had been his masters nigger driver was the way one of his granddaughters put it the whole colony was under nathaniel beauforts control as long as he lived during which time it prospered two of the original colony both women are still living and own their little tracts one residing on her property and the other in the infirmary the descendants of the first settlers owned most of the land but some of it has been lost whether they had any teams and money to start with it is not known to judge mansfield but he thought that they did not both men and women had to work out much of the time for means to go upon the girls toiling as servants in the community for twentyfive to fifty cents per week and their keep the men receiving forty to fifty cents per day often paid in such provisions as meal and meat judged by the management of their own plots they are not a success as farmers most of their soil being now practically worthless the land which was bought for the slaves was never recorded in their names says judge mansfield it was deeded to benjamin ladd as trustee and so stands in the record now judge mansfields last words were there has been no clash over that land because of its run down condition but if coal or oil should be found about there i cannot tell what will happen the financial condition of the colony is no better than it was seventyfive years ago the physical condition is far from being as good two or three of these negroes however showing evidence of thrift are very good farmers they have increased their holdings and built new cabins although most of the old dwellings are still there and are occupied by the descendants of the original settlers they have rapidly increased in numbers and have extensively intermarried from the first the people were religious regular church goers they have two churches among them one methodist and the other baptist their morals have been good having seldom committed crime officers of the law have found very little to do in this community during the life of the colony there have been only two arrests for serious crimes one of which was for stealing a horse and the other for stealing wool both of the accused were sent to the penitentiary no other serious charge has ever been brought against any member of the community so far as judge mansfield knew the original set were fine physical specimens as fine says judge mansfield as the community ever saw separate schools for white and blacks have been maintained from the start nearly all the teachers have been white the preachers have been members of the colony none of them however have gained any particular prominence in any line not even any of the children so far as could be learned had ever been sent off to school the best known of them now are two brothers william and wilson toney both preachers just what acreage they now own i could not learn how much is owned by the best of them also could not be determined the community is called by some mcintyre after the man who carried the slaves up into ohio and by others it is called haiti the latter term is almost wholly used by white people throughout the county and has always been offensive to the negroes although i went to haiti and talked with one of the men judge mansfield gave me practically all the information i will send you more in a few days gathered at other points i have tried to cover your questions and to include other vital ones please call my attention to anything that i might mention to add to the interest or thoroughness of the story i have reported here almost word for word as the facts were given me by the judge and hope the story will have some interest for you i expect to find out a great deal more about that community2 very truly yours c a powell under a protest from afar a goodly number of slaves were settled in lawrence county in 1827 communicated blacks and mulattoes on the 14th april seventy of this description of persons in one company emigrated into and settled within lawrence county they were a part of a stock of slaves emancipated by the last will of a mr ward late of pittsylvania county virginia deceased those unfortunate creatures have little or no property of valuemany of them ragged and dirty it was expected that such a number together in such condition would hardly in ohio find a place where to lay their heads yet so far from meeting with obstacles facilities to settlement were extended to them all of them have found places and many of them have already obtained security as the law requires and probably the balance will within twenty days the writer of this note would censure none for acts of kindness to this unfortunate class of personsyet as he regards the moral character and welfare of society he cannot view these rapid accessions without some degree of alarmthe ohio state journal and columbus gazette may 3 1827 some years later there was established in mercer county another colony which because of its connection with friends in cincinnati then promoting the settlement of negroes on public land became the most promising of the colored communities in ohio sketching the history of that county howe says in the southern part of this county is a colony of colored people amounting to several hundred persons they live principally by agriculture and own extensive tracts of land in the townships of granville franklin and mercer they bear a good reputation for morality and manifest a laudable desire for mental improvement this settlement was founded by the exertions of mr augustus wattles a native of connecticut who instead of merely theorizing upon the evils which prevent the moral and mental advancement of the colored race has acted in their behalf with a philanthropic christianlike zeal that evinces he has their real good at heart the history of this settlement is given in the annexed extract of a letter from him my early education as you well know would naturally lead me to look upon learning and good morals as of infinite importance in a land of liberty in the winter of 18334 i providentially became acquainted with the colored population of cincinnati and found about 4000 totally ignorant of every thing calculated to make good citizens most of them had been slaves shut out from every avenue of moral and mental improvement i started a school for them and kept it up with 200 pupils for two years i then proposed to the colored people to move into the country and purchase land and remove from those contaminating influences which had so long crushed them in our cities and villages they promised to do so provided i would accompany them and teach school i travelled through canada michigan and indiana looking for a suitable location and finally settled here thinking this place contained more natural advantages than any other unoccupied country within my knowledge in 1835 i made the first purchase for colored people in this county in about three years they owned not far from 30000 acres i had travelled into almost every neighborhood of colored people in the state and laid before them the benefits of a permanent home for themselves and of education for their children in my first journey through the state i established by the assistance and cooperation of abolitionists 25 schools for colored children i collected of the colored people such money as they had to spare and entered land for them many who had no money afterwards succeeded in raising some and brought it to me with this i bought land for them i purchased for myself 190 acres of land to establish a manual labor school for colored boys i had sustained a school on it at my own expense till the 11th of november 1842 being in philadelphia the winter before i became acquainted with the trustees of the late samuel emlen of new jersey a friend he left by his will 20000 for the support and education in school learning and the mechanics arts and agriculture such colored boys of african and indian descent whose parents would give them up to the institute we united our means and they purchased my farm and appointed me the superintendent of the establishment which they call the emlen institute in 1846 judge leigh of virginia purchased 3200 acres of land in this settlement for the freed slaves of john randolph of roanoke these arrived in the summer of 1846 to the number of about 400 but were forcibly prevented from making a settlement by a portion of the inhabitants of the county since then acts of hostility have been commenced against the people of this settlement and threats of greater held out if they do not abandon their lands and homeshowes historical collections of ohio pp 355356 coming to shelby county the same historian did not fail to mention a settlement of prosperous negroes who were keeping pace with their white neighbors in van buren township is a settlement of colored people numbering about 400 they constitute half the population of the township and are as prosperous as their white neighbors neither are they behind them in religion morals and intelligence having churches and schools of their own their location however is not a good one the land being too flat and wet an attempt was made in july 1846 to colonize with them 385 of the emancipated slaves of the celebrated john randolph of va after they were driven from mercer county but a considerable party of whites would not willingly permit it and they were scattered by families among the people of shelby and miami who were willing to take themhowes historical collections of ohio pp 465466 this effort at colonizing so many negroes in the state of ohio led to much discussion there arose an antifree negro party which sounded the alarm against such philanthropy and undertook to frighten all blacks away the sentiment of such alarmists may be obtained from the following by the following letter from a gentleman on a tour through virginia to the editor it will appear that we are to have a colony of free negroes no less than five hundred planted in our adjoining county much as we commiserate the situation of those who when emancipated are obliged to leave their country or again be enslaved we trust our constitution and laws are not so defective as to suffer us to be overrun by such a wretched population richmond va may 10 1819 dear sirsince my arrival in this county i have understood that a large family of negroes consisting of about five hundred have lately been liberated and are to be marched to ohio and there settled on land provided for them agreeably to the will of a mr gess who formerly owned them there are persons now engaged in collecting the poor miserable beings from different quarters and driving them like cattle to goochland county from whence they will take up their line of march to ohio i am told that they are perhaps as depraved and ignorant a set of people as any of their kind and that their departure is hailed with joy by all those who have lived in their neighborhood ohio will suffer seriously from the iniquitous policy pursued by the states of virginia and kent in driving all their free negroes upon us the people of ohio are bound in justice to themselves to adopt some counteracting measure many people here are of the opinion that we may be compelled to introduce slavery in ohio in selfdefense and they appear to be gratified that we are suffering many of the evils attending it without as they call it any of the benefits i have been gratified to tell them what i believe to be truethat nineteen twentieths of the people of ohio are so opposed to slavery that they would not consent to its introduction under any circumstances and although they commiserate the situation of those who have been liberated and compelled to abandon their country or again be made slaves yet in justice to themselves and their posterity they will refuse admittance to such a population your most obt a t editor we understand from a respectable authority that 270 of said negroes have landed at ripley and are to settle near the center of brown county on white oak the residue of 500 to follow soon afterquillins the color line in ohio pp 2829 and the supporter chillicothe june 16 1819 in view of this alarm aroused by the socalled negro invasion the ohio colonizationists availed themselves of the opportunity to set forth their plan as the only solution of the problem the following articles are interesting new style colonization it seems that our old friend gerrit smith is anxious to form a colony of colored people in the state of new york it is not known that he pays the expenses of any to get to that happy spot but he certainly offers them a share in the property of earth when they arrive some have thought his effort in this respect another proof of his great liberality perhaps it isbut of the character of those lands we know nothing the journal of commerce seems to understand the subject from the following which we cut from a late number bounty of gerrit smithsome of the newspapers are eulogizing this once sensible man because he is giving away deeds in any number to colored men of forty acre lots of his vast tract in hamilton county the considerations in the deeds are as follows for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar to me in hand paid and being desirious to have all share in the subsistence and happiness which a bountiful god has provided for all has granted sold etc if the negroes do not run away from the bears and wolves and climate and sterility of hamilton county with more anxiety than they ever did from southern slavery then we do not understand their character we do not blame the negroes for getting their liberty if they can but to make them take farms in hamilton county is too bad the wild beasts up there will rejoice in a negro settlement among them especially at the beginning of winter had judge leigh taken the randolph negroes there they might have fared as well as they have done in ohio and certainly he could have gotten the land much cheaper after all there is no place like home and there is no home sweet home for the colored man but in liberia the african repository xxii 320321 freedom in a free state facts are almost daily transpiring which show the immense importance of colonization among them none are more conspicuous than those which come to us from the free states if the colored people cannot enjoy freedom in a free state what can they do where shall they go here is a fact randolphs johnwe are told by the lynchburg virginian that john the wellknown and faithful servant of the late john randolph who with the emancipated slaves of his master went to ohio and were there treated by the citizens in a manner of which our readers have been apprized has returned to charlotte with the intention of petitioning the legislature to allow him to remain in the commonwealth he says they have no feeling for colored people in ohio and if the legislature refuse to grant his petition he will submit to the penalty of remaining and be sold as a slavepreferring this to enjoying freedom in a free state we have been repeatedly asked why do you not send those slaves to liberia to this question we reply we have had nothing to do with them and have reason to believe that they have been prejudiced against going to liberia and in addition to this it is now very doubtful whether they have money enough left to take them to liberia and it would be impossible for us in the present state of our finance to give them a free passage and support them six months after their arrival we have been informed that many of the rest of them would come back to virginia and be slaves rather than remain in ohio if they could get back and yet they are now free and in a free state but what does it all amount to suppose western virginia and northern kentucky were tomorrow to emancipate their slaves what would become of them they could not remain in those states they must remove where shall they go to ohio most easily and as there are more abolitionists in that state than any other more hopefully but would they be admitted there where then shall they go let those who can answer these questions in view of them and such like the scheme of colonization rises in magnificence and grandeur beyond conception this then is the time to aid this scheme that when these thickening events shall turn the tide into liberia there may be strength and intelligence enough there to receive it the african repository xxii 321322 from the colonizationist the randolph slaves plattsville wis august 22 1846 bro gurleyi have observed from time to time with the deepest interest the course pursued by the citizens of ohio toward the emancipated slaves of the late john randolph of virginia i had repeatedly remarked in my lectures as stated in the eleventh annual report of the indiana colonization society that when slaves were emancipated in the south and by the laws of those states as is the case with most of them they are forced to leave and not permitted to remain in any state south to go into the north those northern states would reject them and leave the slave the alternative to choose between returning into bondage or emigrating to liberia in other words liberia offers the only retreat for the slave from bondage where he is required to leave the south the free states may for a short time tolerate the migration of a few colored people among them from the south especially among the abolitionists where they are allowed to have the satisfaction of abducting them from their masters but if the master comes and offers them and especially in large numbers they will be refused on my way to this place i met with a citizen of indiana formerly of virginia who gave me some singular facts on this subject there is living in ohio said he a worthy citizen a mr g a native of virginia who after a residence there of some eight or ten years returned to virginia on a visit to see a brother who still remained in the old dominion mr g gave his brother an interesting account of the prospects and policy of ohio with which he was much pleased the virginia brother remarked to mr g that he found his slaves a great burden to him and requested him to take them all to ohio and set them free i cannot do it said mr g why asked his brother the citizens of ohio will not allow me to bring 100 negroes among them to settle said mr g but said he i can put you upon a plan by which you can get rid of them and get them into ohio very easy do you take them to wheeling and there place them on a steamboat for cincinnati and speak of taking them to new orleans and while you are looking out for another boat give the chance and the abolitionists will steal the whole of them and run them off and then celebrate a perfect triumph over them but if you take them to the same men and ask them to receive and take care of them they will tell you to take care of them yourself the case of the randolph slaves proves that mr g was right and that the view presented in our annual report is a just one mr randolph emancipated his slaves and as they could not remain in virginia they were to be sent to ohiothere they are not allowed to settle and must now return to bondage or go to liberia as yet the burden of embarrassment of a mixed population of blacks is scarcely felt in the north as it must be soon for just as emancipation goes on in the south they must increase in the north unless our plan and policy prevails i cannot say that i regret to see a test of these practical truths for facts speak out loudly to prove the correctness of the best system of policy on these subjects had mr randolphs slaves been allowed to remain in ohio they would have been a downtrodden and oppressed people for all time to come if they go to liberia they will be free in every sense of the term b t kavanaugh the african repository xxii 322323 the republic of liberia the undersigned having been appointed agent of the american colonization society for the state of ohio to solicit funds to aid its operations begs leave to call attention to the statistical facts in reference to the position which this state occupies in relation to the free colored population of the united states and the interest which she has in sustaining the republic of liberia from 1790 to 1810 the increase of the free colored population of the united states was at the average rate of near 6 per cent per annum the average increase of the slaves has been a little over 2 per cent per annum or exactly two and sixtyhundredths the census tables for the whole period up to 1840 indicates that the natural increase of the free colored population is somewhat less than that of the slave i shall suppose it to be 2 per cent per annum the excess of increase over 2 will therefore represent the emancipations in applying this rule it appears that the work of emancipation must have been actively prosecuted from 1790 to 1810 from 1810 to 1820 the rate of increase was reduced to a little less than 2 or exactly two and fortyseven hundredths per cent per annum this indicates that emancipation had ceased to swell in any appreciable degree the number of free colored persons unless we are forced to admit that there is greater mortality amongst freedmen than slaves this cessation of emancipation was before the organization of the colonization society it is supposed to have been caused by the conviction that emancipation upon the soil had wrought but little change in the colored mans condition the sympathies of good men were therefore awakened in behalf of the colored man and colonization proposed and adopted as the best means of securing to him the social and political privileges of which he was deprived the establishment of an independent republic including a population of 80000 souls with foreign exports to the value of 100000 a year and the introduction of civilization and christianity in africa with all their attendant blessings furnishes an answer to the question of the success of the scheme the period of the greatest popularity of the colonization society was from 1820 to 1830 during this time the increase of the free colored population reached to nearly 3 per cent or a half per cent per annum over the natural increase but from 1830 to 1840 the period when the society had the least popularity the increase was but a very small fraction over two per cent per annum being two and eight hundredths indicating that fewer bondmen had been liberated than during any other period indeed the decrease was so great as to reduce the rate of increase more than a half per cent per annum below the natural increase of the slaves and furnished an argument in favor of the idea that freedom in this country is unfavorable to the longevity of the colored man from all these facts we may infer that colonization while its object has been to benefit the free colored man has not been unfavorable to emancipation but colonization has not removed the 450000 free persons of color from our country they remain as a floating body in our midst drifting as the census tables show hither and thither as the effects of climate at the north or foreign emigration at the east or prejudice at the south repel it from those points it is an interesting subject of investigation to watch the movements of the colored population and ascertain where they are tending and whither they will find a resting place in 1810 in the eastern states they commenced a movement from north towards the south and in 1820 began to diverge westward through the most southern of the free states and penetrated into ohio indiana and illinois from 1830 to 1840 pennsylvania alone retained her natural increase while the other eastern and northeastern free states and also the eastern and southeastern slave states all lost or repelled the greater part of their natural increase and some of them a considerable portion besides of the original stock but where have these people gone that is the question which deeply interests ohio the census tables furnish the solution from 1810 to 1840 the colored population of ohio has been increasing at the average rate of 20 per cent per annum the increase for the ten years from 1830 to 1840 was 91 per cent supposing the emigration into ohio since 1840 to have been no greater than before that period her present colored population will be 30000 if to this we add that of indiana and illinois allowing their increase to have been at the same rate these three states will have a population of near 50000 colored persons or one ninth of the present free colored population of the united states ohio therefore cannot remain inactive she must do something these men should have all the stimulants to mental and moral action which we ourselves possess but i shall leave to wiser men than myself the task of devising new means to secure this object while i go forward in my labors for the only one which has yet been successful in securing to any portion of the colored people their just rights the colonization society has in its offer generally more slaves than its means will enable it to send to liberia without a large increase of means therefore the society cannot send out many free persons of color three fourths of the emigrants heretofore have been liberated by their masters with a view of being sent to liberia perhaps it is well that events should have been thus ordered if slaves when emancipated and instructed and made to taste of the sweets of liberty and to feel the responsibilities of nationality can establish a prosperous and happy republic and exert such an extended moral influence as to accomplish infinitely more in removing the greatest curse of africa the slavetrade from a large extent of her coast than has been done at an expense of more than a hundred millions of dollars by the fleets of england and france it reflects the greater honor upon the african race and may serve to stimulate the free people of color of this country to make the effort to join their brethren in a land of freedom in addition to sending emigrants to liberia it is of the utmost importance that the society should purchase the greatest possible amount of territory at the present moment and thus enlarge the sphere of influence which the republic exerts over the natives and put it beyond the power of the nations adverse to her interests to circumscribe her in the noble efforts she is making for the redemption of africa in this connection it may be proper to say that the gift of one dime from each one of the 100000 inhabitants of cincinnati or 10000 would probably purchase fiftysix miles square of territory or more than two millions of acres of land as good as that of ohio now suppose a gift of such value were offered to the colored people of the city or of the state on condition that they would take possession of it and organize a state government for themselves and be admitted as one of the members of the new republic who will say that they should or would reject the offer who will say that it would not be more safe and wise to emigrate to africa than to canada oregon california or mexico but the decision of this question of right belongs to the colored people themselves if the foreign emigration continues to roll in upon us the subordinate stations in society in the west also as is the case already in the east will ere long be chiefly occupied by foreigners and the colored man left it is to be feared without profitable employment dear as is the land of ones birth if mens interests can be better promoted by a removal the ties of country and kindred are bonds easily broken the spirit of enterprise which characterizes the present age if we do our duty will in due time animate the intelligent colored man as it is now stimulating the white race and if he cannot secure equality of condition here will prompt him to go where he can obtain it total number of emigrants up to january 1848 5961 number of communicants in

convention of free colored people in another column we present a circular address to the free colored people of maryland calling a convention to assemble in baltimore the 25th of july to take into consideration their present condition and future prosperity and compare them with the inducements held out to them to emigrate to liberia this movement may be considered indicative of the change that is going on in the minds of the colored people respecting emigration it is well known that heretofore they have been almost entirely insensible to the advantages which they must necessarily enjoy in a land peculiarly their own they have not been entirely free from the control of bad counsellorsnow they seem resolved to take the matter into their own hands and to look at their present condition and future prospects in this country as a matter in which they are personally interested when they do this in earnest the result can be easily foreseen they will desire to escape from their present anomalous condition will yearn to be free and disenthralled to have a land of their own to have rights unquestioned by any superiors where character enterprise education and all that is lovely and noble in life shall combine to elevate and improve them and their children after them to the latest generation african repository xxviii 195196 emigration of the colored race in presenting the circular which will be found in another column of which a committee of colored persons have undertaken the distribution and which was written by one of themselves it gives us pleasure to commend it as the evidence of a new and generally unexpected change of sentiment on the part of the colored population or at least some portion of it it is well known that for twentyfive years the colonization societies in this country have labored to present before that portion of our population the advantages which must accrue to them from emigration to a land where they might enjoy undisturbed those social and material privileges which it was impossible ever to expect they could obtain by a residence of centuries in this country and that these appeals have met with comparatively little attention and in deed have been received with very bad grace by the great mass of those whom it was intended to benefit the cause of this opposition was to be found in the steady and violent animosity of those white fanatics who setting themselves up as the peculiar friends of the blacks represented that the prejudice against their color was merely an arbitrary sentiment which time would weaken or entirely dissipate and that they might still look forward to enjoying in this country an equality in social and political rights with the whites this assumption of peculiar friendliness on the part of the abolitionists and the plausible reasonings with which they approached their colored friends have acquired the confidence of the latter who are now however beginning to awake to a just idea of their condition and future prospects in this country they have discovered that the loudmouthed protestations of the abolitionists are the mere effervescence of an intermeddling and dangerous faction against whose principles the whole unionwhose destruction they have meditatedhas pronounced in tones of thunder a faction whose baleful alliance is shunned most religiously by both of the great parties of the country they have discovered that underground railroads are a device to inveigle the slaves from a condition of comparative comfort into the freedom of starvation with a poor display of political privileges which are mockery in view of their exercise by an ignorant and despised minority that the expectations fostered in behalf of the free blacks are proved to be entirely futile by the continued attitude of opposition held towards them when there is a question of lessening the social and political gulf which divides the races they discover that the rapid immigration of whites from every quarter is encroaching upon their employments and lessening their chance of gaining a thrifty livelihood even in those menial pursuits to which they are chiefly limited with the spread of education and the expansion of republican ideas they become more sensible of their own anomalous and degraded condition and the result is a yearning to be free like those around them to have a land all their own to have rights unquestioned by any superior color to go wherever such privileges may be obtained they see in the growing republics on the west coast of africa a living refutation of the calumnies of the abolitionists against the colonizationists a land where from simple citizenship up to the highest post in the government all is free and open to them and where character enterprise education and honorable ambition have all their appropriate rewards in the order of the state what is better no white man can hope to cast his lot there with the prospect of permanent settlement or transmitting a healthy posterity they see there such men as the late gov russwurm or the present gov roberts sustaining their rule surrounded by their own race with a distinction and dignity which would do honor to any white man they see there pioneers of their own color who in the arts of peace or of war are striking examples of what the emancipation of the mind can effect this is a crisis full of important results to the race in this country and it behooves them now to cast aside all false issues to take into serious consideration in the words of the circular their present condition and future prospects in this country and contrast them with the inducements and prospects opened to them in liberia or any other country we have little doubt as to the quarter to which their preferences will be given although that is as yet left an open question trinidad is a failure jamaica is a halfruined british dependency and in both the white man the sole source of authority liberia excepted haiti is the only point left and here reigns a perpetual jealousy between the black and mulatto moreover the imperial rule set up there is repugnant to their feelings and inclinations for strange to say in the midst of depression this race in america has become imbued with a sentiment of republicanism and a love for its system which will make them in africa the sedulous imitators of ourselves in all but in the misfortune of introducing another race to be perpetually subservient to themselves in this career we are happy to believe they will run rejoicing long after the privations of their forefathers in this country shall have been forgotten african repository xxviii 196197 circular pursuant to an invitation given through the columns of the baltimore daily papers to the free colored population of baltimore friendly to calling a state convention to be held in this city some time during the ensuing summer to take into consideration their present position and future prospects in this country and to compare the same with the inducements and prospects held out to them to emigrate to liberia or elsewhere a respectable number assembled in the school room of st james colored church corner of saratoga and north streets the meeting being duly organized it was resolved that a convention of delegates of the free colored population from each county of the state of maryland and of the city of baltimore be held in this city on the 25th of july next for the purpose above stated resolved that a committee of three be appointed to issue a circular addressed to the

unanimously approved and adopted address to the free colored people of the state of maryland brethrenwhereas the present age is one distinguished for inquiry investigation and enterprise in physical moral and political sciences above all past ages of the world one in which the nations of the earth seem to have arisen from the slumber of ages and are putting forth their utmost energies to obtain all those blessings which nature and natures god seem to have intended that man should enjoy and the principles set forth by the american sages in the declaration of independence of these united states that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with each revolving year have extended wider and wider throughout the habitable globe and sunk deeper and deeper into the hearts of millions of men and as we humbly hope are destined to revolutionize the civil and political conditions of all the nations of the earth it would indeed be passing strange if the free colored man in this country which gave birth to those elevated and sublime sentiments should feel nothing of the force of their mighty import and with anxious eye and panting heart endeavor in this or some other country to realize the blessings so freely enjoyed by the white citizens of this land actuated by these feelings we have presumed to address our brethren of our native state and we do hereby respectfully solicit them to assemble with us in this city on the 25th of next month july to take into serious consideration our present condition and future prospects in this country and contrast them with the inducements and prospects opened to us in liberia or any other country in conformity with a resolution passed at the meeting held on the 24th ultimo the committee do hereby respectfully propose that each county in the state shall have the privilege of sending any number of delegates not exceeding six as they may deem proper and our brethren throughout the state are requested to hold meetings by legal permission in their several counties for the purpose of selecting their delegates and to collect money to defray the expenses they may incur by attending the said convention as the object for which this convention is called is one of vital importance to the free colored people of maryland it is greatly to be desired and confidently expected that a full attendance of delegates will be present on the occasion who will calmly deliberately and intelligently consider the object for which they have been called together and that each delegate will come prepared to contribute his portion of information and fully and freely to express his views on the great subject of our future destiny delegates are requested to bring credentials of their appointment from the chairman and secretary of the meeting at which they were appointed but in counties where no formal meeting is held

dobson joseph bantem there was considerable excitement among a number of outsiders opposed to the meeting and its objects who frequently assailed the delegates coming to the convention and a large number of whom having come into the room were ripe for any further opposition they could exhibit the dorchester county delegation having seen this state of things several of them arose and remarked that they did not think that their presence here could be of any benefit and they there proposed to withdraw and go home this announcement was received with applause and cries of good from the opponents of colonization a member from kent county begged the delegates to stand firm in their position and the result of their labors would be of much benefit applause and hisses john h walker of baltimore arose and read the circular calling the convention which was to take into consideration the present condition and future prospects of the colored race he said they lived in the same state that their fathers had lived in but not under the same constitutionthe new instrument not recognizing the colored people at all they were men but not recognized as men he alluded to the legislation of the members of the assembly all of which resulted in oppression to the colored race each consecutive session he desired that the condition of the colored people should be considered by this convention that they should decide on what course to take the circular alluded to emigration to liberia or elsewhere which he explained to mean that they should examine all the places and see if emigration would be beneficial it was necessary for them to know the geographical position and resources of the different countriesof their rivers mountains harbors climate c and if the convention should determine on any particular place for emigration it was necessary to ascertain all that would be wanted in such country for one he intended now to remain where he was but if a better place could be found why he was gone for it the speaker was opposed at first but finally gained the attention of the audience and was frequently applauded william perkins of kent county said he believed that much of the opposition and excitement which had sprung up about this convention within a few days was caused by a report falsely circulated that the colonization society had given 700 for carrying out certain objects through its medium he hoped that after the explanation that had been given the dorchester county delegation would consent to remain a member from dorchester county said that if they were assured that the colored people of baltimore desired them to remain they would do so their object was to consult for the good of the colored race perry e walker of frederick said they had come here supposing that the majority of the colored people of baltimore were in favor of the call of the convention cries of no they are not he and his associates had come to consider into the condition of their racehad no other object in view rev darius stokes addressed the convention the object of which he said was to consult only in reference to the condition of the colored people they had been told for thirty years past of countries which were better for them but they had only to depend upon the representation of others as to the truths of these statements they were a peoplethe colored people of the state of marylandwho should consult about their present condition and future prospects he said their white friends were getting tired of helping them because they did not seem disposed it was alleged to help themselves he asked where were their schools orphan asylums c as to going to africa he was in favor of any man going where he thought he could do better cries of good right thats it p oilman not a delegate asked to be heard and after a great deal of confusion got the attention of the audience and spoke in opposition to what mr stokes had said he remarked that he could not talk as well as stokes but he could think as well laughter as for him he came here to put down and oppose this convention cries of good and cheers from the audience henry zeddicks of frederick said that they were here from pure motives to consult for their good and was received with much favor by the whole assemblage james a jones of kent said he was decidedly in favor of emigrationand emigration to africa they expected to be honored in coming into the presence of baltimore friends but in this the largest city of the state they found a great amount of confusion in his opinion he believed that the colored man could never rise to eminence except in africain the land of their forefathers a voiceshow it in africa he pointed to liberia he believed that africa was the only place where the colored man could expect to be a freeman on taking his seat he was hissed by the opponents of emigration the committee on nominating permanent officers recommended the following who were accepted presidentrev william tasker of frederick vice presidentsc sinclair of dorchester levi rogers of kent e lawson of frederick s w hill of east baltimore charles dobson of talbot francis johns of west baltimore and john webb of caroline secretaries john h walker of baltimore and josiah hughes of dorchester rev darius stokes addressed the convention in an eloquent and fervent style in reference to its objects james a jones of kent said that since he had addressed the convention he had been informed that his head if not his life was in danger if he left the room he would therefore leave under the protection of the police and send in the morning his resignation rev darius stokes begged mr jones to remainthat the young colored gentlemen of baltimore were not disposed to harm him people had said that they had met here to sell their rights and liberties but they would show them tomorrow that they only looked to their welfare and interests this was the first time a colored convention of the whole state had ever assembled in the statea remarkable era in their history on motion of mr stokes a committee of tenwere appointed to prepare a platform for the convention the following was the committeeh h webb of baltimore james a jones of kent charles o fisher of baltimore b jenifer and thomas fuller of dorchester jacob lewis of caroline joseph bantem of talbot perry e walker of frederick william williams of baltimore and henry hopkins of harford the convention then adjourned till tuesday morning second days proceedings the convention reassembled at 10 oclock on tuesday the 27th at washington hall the rev william tasker of frederick president in the chair the convention was opened with prayer by the president a note was received from h h webb of baltimore declining to serve as a delegate to the convention stating that he was not able to attend and did not approve of the manner in which he was elected in the absence of josiah hughes of dorchester one of the secretaries cornelius campbell was appointed to fill the vacancy the proceedings of monday not being ready on motion the report in the sun was read in lieu thereof william williams of baltimore arose and stated that his name appeared in the committee on the platform through a mistakehe was not a delegate to the convention on motion james a handy of baltimore and william perkins of kent were appointed on the platform committee to fill the vacancies occasioned by the withdrawal of webb and williams charles wyman and allen lockerman delegates from caroline co appeared and took their seats several of the delegates from dorchester county and other places were not present having gone home in consequence of the disturbances on monday afternoon b jenifer chairman of the committee on the platform made the following report which was read by charles o fisher whereas the present age is one distinguished for enquiry investigation enterprise and improvement in physical political intellectual and moral sciences we hold the truths to be selfevident that we are as well as all mankind created equal and are endowed by our creator with the right to enquire into our present condition and future prospects and as a crisis has arisen in our history presenting a bright and glorious future may we not hope that ere long the energies of our people may be aroused from their lethargy and seek to obtain for themselves and posterity the rights and privileges of freementherefore resolved that while we appreciate and acknowledge the sincerity of the motives and the activity of the zeal of those who during an agitation of twenty years have honestly struggled to place us on a footing of social and political equality with the white population of this country yet we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that no advance has been made towards a result to us so desirable but that on the contrary our condition as a class is less desirable than it was twenty years ago resolved that in the face of an emigration from europe which is greater each year than it was the year before and during the prevalence of a feeling in regard to us which the very agitation intended for good has only served apparently to embitter we cannot promise ourselves that the future will do that which the past has failed to accomplish resolved that recognising in ourselves the capacity to conduct honorably and creditably in public affairs to acquire knowledge and to enjoy the refinements of social intercourse and having a praiseworthy ambition that this capacity should be developed to its full extent we are naturally led to enquire where this can best be done satisfied as we are that in this country at all events from present appearances it is out of the question resolved that in comparing the relative advantages of canada the west indies and liberiathese being the places beyond the limits of the united states to which circumstances have directed our attentionwe are led to examine the claims of liberia particularly where alone we have been told that we can exercise all the functions of a free republican government and hold an honorable position among the nations of the earth resolved that in thus expressing our opinions it is not our purpose to counsel emigration as either necessary or proper in every case the transfer of an entire people from one country to another must necessarily be the work of generationseach individual now and hereafter must be governed by the circumstances of his own condition of which he alone can be the judge as well in regard to the time of removal as to the place to which he shall remove but deeply impressed ourselves with the conviction that sooner or later removal must take place we would counsel our people to accustom themselves to the idea of it and in suggesting liberia to them we do so in the belief that it is there alone they can reasonably anticipate an independent national existence resolved that as this subject is one of greatest importance to us and the consideration of which whatever may be the result can not be put aside we recommend to our people in this state to establish and maintain an organization in regard to it the great object of which shall be enquiry and discussion which without committing any one shall lead to accurate information and that a convention like the present composed of delegates from the counties and baltimore city be annually held at such time and place as said convention in their judgment may designate a motion was made to accept the report which led to debate john h walker speaking at length in opposition to the resolutions and hoped that they would be referred back to the committee contending that there should have been a recommendation to raise a fund to fee a lawyer or some influential citizen of this state to go to annapolis next winter to endeavor to obtain a change of legislation in reference to the colored race b jenifer of dorchester replied to walker urging that his views were in opposition to the spirit of the circular which called them together and a majority of the delegates present at one oclock the convention took a recess afternoon sessionthe convention reassembled at 4 oclock the resolutions being again debated by various delegatesjohn h walker b jenifer c perry and others rev darius stokes moved to lay the motion to adopt the platform on the table which was determined in the affirmative on motion of mr stokes the convention went into the committee of the whole charles williamson in the chair and took up the report of the committee in sections the two first resolutions were adopted the third referred back to the committee and pending the further action on the remainder of the resolutions the convention adjourned till wednesday morning third days proceedings the convention reassembled at 10 oclock on wednesday the 28th at plowman street hall ephraim lawson vice president in the chair who opened the proceedings with prayer a note was received from the president rev william tasker stating that indisposition would prevent him from presiding over the deliberations of the body the remainder of its sessions the attendance of the delegates was small in the morning and very few lookers on were present the platform being again taken up f harris of baltimore presented a protest against the adoption of the fourth resolution which pointed out liberia as the place of emigration for the colored people because it recommends emigration to that place contrary to the wishes of his constituents and a majority of the free colored people of the city and state he contended that if they were for liberia they should say so at once and tell the mob out doors that they were endeavoring to send them all therenot say one thing in the convention and another outside james a jones of kent said that harris was endeavoring to shape his course the way the wind blowed for himself he hoped the entire platform would be adopted and without further debate he moved that the fourth resolution be passed stephen w hill of baltimore contended that the resolutions did not look to an immediate emigration to africathat they only recommended liberia as a place where they could enjoy the blessings of liberty and as the most suitable country for the colored man whenever they should be disposed to seek another home william perkins of kent in answer to the protest of harris said the only platform they recommended for adoption left it to every man to go where he pleased or to remain here if it suited him better let mr harris go to his constituents and tell them that the convention only recommended what it thought best its action was binding on no man f harris in reply asked if the convention had examined liberia they recommended that place for them to emigrate to and yet they had not made any examination of liberia to know whether it would suit did they know anything of the climate or agriculture of liberia to lay before the people let them examine canada jamaica and other places and then if they found liberia the best place why say so to the people chas williamson said he had had it in his power to examine most countries he had been in canada twice in the west indies three times and under the british government in trinidad five years during that time he had examined the countries with a view to see which was the best for the colored people he was sixtyseven years of age and could expect little for himself in the west indies capital ruled the peoplethe government recognized you but the planters who had been accustomed to drive on slaves knew you not if they went to canada they would not better their conditionhe had lived there seventeen months at one time it would cost money to get to canadamoney to get to the west indies the canadas are peopled with many persons from this country the leading men were principally yankees in the west indies he had to take his hat around to get the dead out of the way of the turkeybuzzardsthat showed their sympathy in canada you cannot be recognized in officein the west indies it is better and some colored persons get into office in the canadas he never heard of but one colored man being in office the canadas are a fine country but he asserted here that he felt there could be no permanent home for them except in africa where their children could enjoy all the blessings of liberty that was the best country for them in the united states they did not want the colored people any more they had got the use of them and now in this state the new constitution did not recognize them at all a voiceyes as chattels the minister of hayti to this country was not recognized by the president and had to go home again liberia on the west coast of africa had as fine or better climate as regards atmosphere than the west indies he wished to go where they would be free for their moral culture here he considered out of the question james a handy of baltimore remarked that they lived in an interesting age of the worldthat it was the glory of our day that assistance is offered to the immortal principles of man and it struggles to free itself from the trammels and superstitions of the past and of the oppressions and burthens of the present we live in an age of physical moral and intellectual wonders and that man is truly fortunate who lives at the present and has the privilege of aiding in carrying forward the great enterprise of redeeming disenthralling and restoring back in all their primitive glory three millions of down trodden people to the land of their forefathers on the western shore of africa there was the infant republic of liberia attracting the attention of all the enlightened nations of the earth for four years she had maintained her position as an independent state and today she was prosperous happy and free acknowledged by england france russia and prussiafour of the greatest powers of the earth and before this year is out the united states will be willing ready and anxious to cultivate friendly relations with that garden spotthat heritage which a kind and overruling providence has prepared for us and not only for us but for all the sable sons and daughters of ham one word in relation to the inducements held out by liberiaasia could not exceed the variety of the productions of africaeurope with her numerous manufactories and internal resources could not cope with her in physical greatnessamerica with her noble institutions elements of power facilities of improvement promises of greatness and high hopes of immortality was this day far very far behind her in natural resources nothing can excel the value of her productionssugarcane grows rapidly cotton is a native plant corn and hemp flourish in great perfection oranges coffee wild honey lemons limes mahogany camwood satinwood rosewood c abound there mules oxen horses sheep hogs fowls of all kinds are in the greatest abundance she holds out a rich temptation to commerce and a strong inducement to emigration to the latter the united states owed what she was making her one of the most effective nations of the world for years the glorious galaxy of stars which arose in the western hemisphere have been casting their generous grateful light over the social moral and political darkness of the east but today the commanding tide of commerce is changing from the pacific shores the genius of american enterprise and industry has opened a nearer highway to the celestial empire and is now by a closer interchange of fraternal relations unbolting the massive doors and securing the commerce of china and japan on the lap of american civilization and around the altars of this christian land have been born the moral elements of civil and christian power ordained by heaven for the redemption of africa for the last 2000 years that wretched land of mystery and crime has been abandoned to the cupidity of most cruel barbarism surpassing in degradation guilt and woe all other nations of the earth preeminently high on the page of prophetic scripture is chronicled in most unequivocal language the name and future redemption of africa for twelve centuries the problem how shall africa be redeemed has been unsolved although earnestly sought for by the civil and religious powers of europe but in every instance it has been in vain and the cloud of her wretchedness blackened on each failure mysterious and inscrutable are the ways of providence to accomplish her restoration lift her from the jaws of death bind her as a jewel to the throne of righteousness and give her a place among the civilized nations of mankind god in his pity wisdom and goodness has opened the way for a part of her crushed children predoomed by bloody superstitions to altars of death to be delivered from immolation and find an asylum under a form of ameliorated service in the bosom of this country and here their children have been born elevated and blessed under redeeming auspices in the lapse of time by the same benevolent providence many of this people have become free and to such the voice of heaven emphatically speaks thundering forth in invigorating terms arise and depart for this is not your rest this makes us bold in saying that emigration is the only medium by which the long closed doors of that continent are to be opened by her own childrens returning bearing social and moral elements of civil and religious power by which that continent is to be resuscitated renovated and redeemed thirtyone years ago the first emigrant ship that ever sailed eastward from these shores to africa conveying to that dark land a missionary family of some two hundred soulsher own returning children enriched with the more enduring treasures of the western world there by them on the borders of that continent overshadowed with the deepest gloom were raised the first rude temples of civilizationthe first halls of enlightened legislationthe first christian altars to the worship of almighty god that have ever proved successful or of any permanent practical utility then and there arose the long promised light the star of hope to the benighted millions of africa since that day the star has risen higher and higher the light extended along the coast and reaching far back towards the mountains of the moon radiating elevating and purifying and today we behold a nation born on the western coast of africa respected prosperous and happy here then is practically and beautifully solved on the true utilitarian principles of this wonderworking age the mysterious problem by whom is africa to be redeemed the answer comes rumbling back to us over the towering billows of the atlantic from the republic of liberia with a voice that starts our inmost souls falling with ponderous weight upon the ears of the free colored people of this unionthou art the man thou art the woman james a jackson of baltimore eulogized hayti as standing as high above the other west india islands as the united states does above the republic of mexico in the point of commercial importance this island had tried the experiment of republicanism and had changed it it was now a question with the colored people in their present condition whether they were more suited to a republican than monarchical government the productions of the soil of hayti and of her forests were referred to and the fact alleged that she would produce more than all the other west india islands put together the exports and imports of the united states to and from the island were cited as an illustration of her prosperity a comparison was made of the commerce of liberia and that of hayti the latter country being held up in a very favorable light nicholas penn of frederick spoke in favor of emigration to liberia they did not want an island the colored population increased so fast that they needed no island but a continent for them his constituents wished him to examine africa and he hoped it would be done liberia was the only place for them the white man fought for and claimed this country and he was now going to give it up to them in the language of patrick henry will we be ready tomorrow or next day to act more than now no now was the time and he hoped this enterprise would spread far and wide until the whole people should understand it and all unite in the glorious movement let us appoint men to go and examine liberia and report to us just what it is we want a home and we were sent here to examine and determine on what would be best to recommend b jenifer of dorchester said all these statements about africa were theoreticalgained through geography and went on to state that he had spent nearly eleven months in africa had traveled it over and examined its productions and resources he had been sent for that purpose by a colored colonization society of his county but did not wish to discuss liberia at this time mr handy had so ably discussed the subject and in all of which he fully coincided with him the true question for this convention to decide was whether they should remain here or to seek a home in liberia or elsewhere john h walker after some difficulty got the floor and offered a substitute for the report of the committee on the platform which was unanimously adopted the following is the substitute whereas the present age is one eminently distinguished for inquiry investigation enterprise and improvement in physical political intellectual and moral sciences and whereas among our white neighbors every exertion is continually being made to improve their social and moral condition and develop their intellectual faculties and whereas it is a duty which mankind colored as well as white owe to themselves and their creator to embrace every opportunity for the accomplishment of this mental culture and intellectual development and general social improvement and whereas we the free colored people of the state of maryland are conscious that we have made little or no progress in improvement during the past twenty years but are now sunken into a condition of social degradation which is truly deplorable and the continuing to live in which we cannot but view as a crime and transgression against our god ourselves and our posterity and whereas we believe that a crisis in our history has arrived when we may choose for ourselves degradation misery and wretchedness on the one hand or happiness honor and enlightenment on the other by pursuing one of two paths which are now laid before us for our consideration and choice may we not therefore hope that our people will awaken from their lethargic slumbers and seek for themselves that future course of conduct which will elevate them from their present position and place them on an equality with the other more advanced races of mankindmay we not hope that they will consider seriously the selfevident proposition that all men are created equal and endowed by the creator with the same privileges of exerting themselves for their own and each others benefit and whereas in view of these considerations and in order to commence the great and glorious work of our moral elevation and our social and intellectual improvement we are of the opinion that an organization of the friends of this just and holy cause is absolutely necessary for effecting the object so much to be desired and we are therefore resolved that we will each and every one here pledge ourselves to each other and to our god to use on every and all occasions our utmost efforts to accomplish the objects set forth in the foregoing preamble and that we will now and forever hereafter engraft this truth in our prayers our hopes our instructions to our brethren and our childrennamely that degradation is a sin and a source of misery and it is a high and honorable and a blessed privilege we enjoy the right to improve ourselves and transmit to posterity happiness instead of our miseryknowledge instead of our ignorance resolved that while we appreciate and acknowledge the sincerity of the motives and the activity of the zeal of those who during an agitation of twenty years have honestly struggled to place us on a footing of social and political equality with the white population of the country yet we cannot conceal from ourselves the fact that no advancement has been made towards a result to us so desirable but that on the contrary our condition as a class is less desirable now than it was twenty years ago resolved that in the face of an emigration from europe which is greater each year than it was the year preceding and during the prevalence of a feeling in regard to us which the very agitation intended for good has only served apparently to embitter we cannot promise ourselves that the future will do that which the past has failed to accomplish resolved that we recognize in ourselves the capacity of conducting our own public affairs in a manner at once creditable and well calculated to further among us the cause of religion virtue morality truth and enlightenmentand to acquire for ourselves the possession and enjoyment of that elevated refinement which so much adorns and beautifies social intercourse among mankind and leads them to a proper appreciation of the relations existing between man and deityman and his fellow men and man and that companion whom god has bestowed upon him to console him in the hours of trouble and darkness or enjoy with him the blessings that heaven vouchsafed occasionally to shower upon our pathway through life resolved that in a retrospective survey of the past we see between the white and colored races a disparity of thought feeling and intellectual advancement which convinces us that it cannot be that the two races will ever overcome their natural prejudices towards each other sufficiently to dwell together in harmony and in the enjoyment of like social and political privileges and we therefore hold that a separation of ourselves from our white neighbors many of whom we cannot but love and admire for the generosity they have displayed towards us from time to time is an object devoutly to be desired and the consummation of which would tend to the natural advantage of both races resolved that comparing the relative advantages afforded us in canada the west indies and liberiathese being the places beyond the limits of the united states which circumstances have directed our attentionwe are led to examine the claims of liberia particularly for there alone we have been told that we can exercise all the functions of a free republican government and hold an honorable position among the nations of the earth resolved that this convention recommend to the colored people of maryland the formation of societies in the counties of the state and the city of baltimore who shall meet monthly for the purpose of raising means to establish and support free schools for the education of our poor and destitute children and for the appointment each month of a person whose duty it shall be to collect such information in relation to the condition of the colored emigrants in canada west indies guiana and liberia as can be obtained by him from all available sources which information shall be brought to these monthly meetings above alluded to and read before them for the instruction of all in order that when they are resolved if they should so resolve to remove from this country to any other they may know what will be their wants opportunities prospects c in order to provide beforehand for any emergencies that may meet them on their arrival in their new homes resolved that as this subject is one of the greatest importance to us and the consideration of which whatever may be the result cannot be put aside we recommend to our people in this state to establish and maintain an organization in regard to it the great object of which shall be enquiry and discussion which without committing any may lead to accurate information and that a convention like the present composed of delegates from the respective counties of the state and from baltimore city be held annually at such times and places as may be hereafter designated resolved that in thus expressing our opinions it is not our purpose to counsel emigration as either necessary or proper in every case the transfer of an entire people from one country to another must necessarily be the work of generations each individual now and hereafter must be governed by the circumstances of his own condition of which he alone can be the judge as well in regard to the time of removal as to the place to which he shall remove but deeply impressed ourselves with the conviction that sooner or later removal must take place we would counsel our people to accustom themselves to that idea resolved that this convention recommend to the ministers of the gospel among the free colored population of maryland to endeavor by contributions from their congregations and by other means to raise funds for the purpose of forwarding the benevolent object of educating the children of the destitute colored persons in this state and that they also impress upon the minds of their hearers the benefits which would necessarily result from development of their intellects and the bringing into fullest use those mental powers and reasoning faculties which distinguish mankind from the brute creation and that this be requested of them as a part of their duty as ministers of the religion of our lord and saviour jesus christ e harris entered his protest against the adoption of the fourth resolution a motion made to adjourn sine die at 2 oclock pm was lost and a resolution restricting each speaker to five minute speeches was adopted william perkins spoke of the law enforced in kent by which the children of free colored persons whom the officers decided the parents were unable to support were bound out and also of the law which prohibited a colored person returning to the state if he should happen to leave it they were oppressed and borne down james a jones of kent thought his native county equal to any other in the state and that colored persons were not more oppressed there than elsewhere in the state charles o fisher moved that a committee of five be appointed to draw up a memorial to the legislature of maryland praying more indulgence to the colored people of the state in order that they may have time to prepare themselves for a change in their condition and for removal to some other land daniel koburn of baltimore in referring to the oppressive laws of the state said the hog law of baltimore was better moderated than that in reference to the colored people the hog law said at certain seasons they should run about and at certain seasons be taken up but the law referring to colored people allowed them to be taken up at any time chas dobson of talbot said that the time had come when free colored men in this country had been taken up and sold for one year and when that year was out taken up and sold for another year who knew what the next legislature would do and if any arrangements could be made to better their condition he was in favor of them he was for the appointing the committee on the memorial b jenifer of dorchester opposed the resolution he was not in favor of memorializing the legislatureit had determined to carry out certain things and it was a progressive work chas wyman of caroline jos bantem of talbot john h walker chas o fisher and others discussed the resolution which was finally adopted the following is the committee appointed jno h walker and jas a handy of baltimore william perkins of kent thomas fuller of dorchester and daniel j ross of hartford county a resolution of thanks to the officers of the convention the reporters of the morning papers and authorities for their protection was adopted the proceedings were also ordered to be printed in pamphlet form the convention at 3 oclock adjourned to meet on the second monday in november 1853 at frederick md from the baltimore sun july 27 28 and 29 1852 reviews of books the slaveholding indians volume i as slaveholder and secessionist by annie heloise abel phd the arthur h clark company cleveland 1915 pp 394 this is the first of three volumes on the slaveholding indians planned by the author volume ii is to treat of the indians as participants in the civil war and volume iii on the indian under reconstruction the present volume deals with a phase as the author says of american civil war history which has heretofore been almost neglected or where dealt with either misunderstood or misinterpreted it comes as a surprise to most of us that the indian played a part of sufficient importance within the union to have the right to have something to say about secession yet inconsistently enough he was considered so much a foreigner that both the south and the north particularly the former found it expedient to employ diplomacy in approaching him the south we are assured found the attitude of the indians toward secession of the greatest importance yet it was not the indian owner so much as the indian country that the confederacy wanted to be sure of possessing for indian territory occupied a position of strategic importance from both the economic and the military point of view the possession of it was absolutely necessary for the political and institutional consolidation of the south texas might well think of going her own way and of forming an independent republic once again when between her and arkansas lay the immense reservations of the great tribes they were slaveholding tribes too yet were supposed by the united states government to have no interest whatsoever in a sectional conflict that involved the very existence of the peculiar institution the above quotation is practically the intent of the book and the author has succeeded in carrying this out in four divisions entitled i the general situation in the indian country 18301860 ii indian territory in its relations with texas and arkansas iii the confederacy in negotiation with the indian tribes iv the indian nations in alliance with the confederacy the book is essentially a work by a scholar for scholars it is certainly not for the laity the facts are striking but well substantiated there can be no doubt but that much time has been spent in its compilation the style however is unusually dry it has appendices an invaluable bibliography a carefully tabulated index four maps and three portraits of indian leaders it is interesting to note that the author is of british birth and ancestry and so presumably is free from sectional prejudice her book marks a distinct step forward for those who are interested in indian affairs jessie fauset the political history of slavery in the united states by james z george formerly chief justice of the supreme court of mississippi and later united states senator from that state the neale publishing company new york 1915 pp xix 342 this is a discussion as well as the history of slavery and reconstruction from the time of the introduction of the slaves in 1619 to the breakup of the carpetbagger governments considering the jealousies and even animosities that are becoming more and more intensified between the north and south as well as the disposition that is ever increasing in the stronger section to dominate the weaker the author believes that it is becoming necessary to think over calmly and seriously the causes that have produced these evils and to ascertain if we can the remedy if remedy there be the work begins with a sketch of ancient slavery showing that the introduction of the institution into the southern states was not exceptional he then gives an account of slavery in the colonies and the efforts to suppress the slave trade the connection of slavery with the war of 1812 and with the hartford convention is noted he then takes up the missouri compromise with some detail giving almost verbatim the proceedings of congress relative thereto in the same way he treats the repudiation of the missouri compromise the annexation of texas the wilmot proviso the kansasnebraska affair the lincoln and douglas debates john browns invasion secession the civil war and reconstruction throughout this treatise he carefully notes the jealousy of sectional interest and power and the determination to maintain this power even at a cost of a dissolution of the union in other words the whole sectional struggle grew out of what he calls the effort to maintain the balance of power between two sections of the union with the slavery question contributing thereto facts set forth bring out very clearly that the south is not to be censured as being especially hostile to the negro when on the statute books of the north there are found numerous laws to show that persons of color were not considered desirables in those states he raises the question as to whether the south violated the missouri compromise and considers it a revolution that public functionaries disregarded the rights of the owners of slave property when the highest tribunal the supreme court had sanctioned these rights the act of secession is palliated too on the ground that the south had developed under the influence of that peculiar political philosophy which produced there a race that could never sanction passive obedience in seceding the south was not attempting to overturn the government of the united states it was not contemplated to interfere with the states adhering to the union they sought merely to withdraw themselves from subjection to a government which they were convinced intended to overthrow their institutions the civil war came in spite of the fact that the convention that framed the constitution negatived the proposition to confer on the federal government the authority to exert the force of the union against a delinquent state it was therefore a mere act of coercing a section preparing for selfdefense reconstruction is treated very much in the same way the laws under which it was effected were unjust the men who executed them were harsh and the weaker section had to pay the price the book cannot be classed as scientific work the topics discussed are not proportionately treated the style is rendered dull by the incorporation of undigested material and the emphasis is placed on the political and legal phases of history at the expense of the social and economic in it we find very little that is new it merely presents the wellknown political theory of the old south the chief value of the work consists in its being an expression of the opinion of a distinguished man who participated in many of the events narrated j o burke the constitutional doctrines of justice harlan by floyd barzilia clark phd assistant professor of political science in pennsylvania state college series xxxiii no 4 johns hopkins university studies in historical and political science under the direction of the department of history political economy and political science the johns hopkins press baltimore 1915 this work is a legal treatise consisting of a scholarly discussion of the doctrines advanced by justice harlan during his service as a member of the supreme court of the united states the book opens with a brief biography of the jurist emphasizing the important events of his career to furnish a basis for the study of his theories the author then takes up such topics as the suability of states the impairment of the obligation contracts due process of law interstate and foreign commerce equal protection of the laws the jurisdiction of courts miscellaneous topics and judicial legislation the author finds that in the treatment of these important legal questions harlan measures up to the standard of an able jurist replying to those who have charged him with emphasizing too greatly the letter of the law the writer says that such a contention is based on ignorance or prejudice no one who so interpreted the eleventh amendment says the author as to maintain that a suit against the officer of a state in his official capacity was not a suit against a state could have held to the strict letter of the law the author further contends that this criticism of the jurist arises from the fact that he did not believe in equivocation the interpretation of the laws relating to the negro the point on which he dissented from the majority of the members of the court should have been given more prominence in this discussion the discriminations against the negroes are treated in connection with the chapters on interstate and foreign commerce and equal protection of the laws the fourteenth amendment is treated along with such miscellaneous topics as direct taxation copyrights insular cases interstate comity and labor legislation stating justice harlans theory as to the position the negro should occupy in this country however the author writes very frankly harlan he thought believed that they should occupy the position that historically they were intended to occupy by the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments he believed that the law should be interpreted as it was meant and not as the court thought expedient and wise though it may be true that his relation to the negro in political matters may have made him more violent in his dissents any one who will look fairly at the question must conclude that his doctrine was legally correct and as time passes and as both classes become better educated and broader in their views it may be said that the tendency of the court is likely to be to interpret the laws largely as he thought they should have been interpreted that is as historically they were meant c b walter reconstruction in georgia economic social political 18651872 by c mildred thompson phd longmans green and company new york 1915 pp 418 the appearance of c m thompsons reconstruction in georgia arouses further interest in the study of that period which has been attracting the attention of various investigators in the leading universities of the united states these writers fall into different groups coming to the defense of a section shamed with crime some have endeavored to justify the deeds of those who resorted to all sorts of schemes to rid the country of the extravagant and corrupt reconstruction governments lately however the tendency has been to get away from this position yet among these writers we still find varying types many of whom have for several reasons failed to write real history some have not forsaken the controversial group not a few have tried to explain away the truth and others going to the past with their minds preoccupied have selected only those facts which support their contentions what has this author in question done in this readable and interesting work the writer has shown considerable improvement upon historical writing in this field she has endeavored to deal not only with the political but also with the economic and social phases of the history of this period one gets a glance at the state before the war the transition from slavery to freedom the problems of labor and tenancy the commercial revival the social readjustment political reorganization military rule state economy reorganized reconstruction agriculture education the administration of justice the ku klux disorder and the restoration of home rule this research leads the author to conclude that the seven years of the history of the state from 1865 to 1872 marked only the beginning of the social and economic transformation that has taken place since the war this upheaval broke up the large plantation system removed from power the slave oligarchy and exalted the yeomanry of moderate means the uplanders now in control in the south when the democratic rule replaced republicanism one set of abnormal influences were put at rest economic and social problems becoming the allengrossing topics and politics a diversion rather than a matter of selfpreservation the race problem then aroused began in another age and not being settled has been bequeathed to a later generation emancipation itself would have aroused racial antagonism but republican reconstruction increased it a hundred fold this was the most enduring contribution of congressional interference politically reconstruction in georgia was a failure the greatest political achievement of the period was the enfranchisement of the negro but this was soon undone the southern white man having no freedom of choicehe had to be a democrat whether or no although establishing the negro in freedom the government failed to establish him in political and social equality with the whites but still says the author the race problem and the cry of negro negro the slogan of political demagogues who magnify and distort a very real difficulty in playing upon the passions of the less educated whitesrise to curtail freedom of thought and act out of this mass of material examined one would expect a more unbiased treatment the work suffers from some of the defects of most reconstruction writers although the author has endeavored to write with restraint and care one man is made almost a hero while another is found wanting the white southerner could not but be a democrat but no excuse is made for the negro who had no alternative but to ally himself with those who claimed to represent his emancipator the state was at one time bordering on economic ruin because the negroes became migratory and would not comply with their labor contracts little is said however about the evils arising from the attitude of southern white men who have never liked to work and that of those who during this period according to the author formed roving bands for plundering and stealing but we are too close to the history of reconstruction to expect better treatment we are just now reaching the period when we can tell the truth about the american revolution we must yet wait a century before we shall find ourselves far enough removed from the misfortunes and crimes of reconstruction to set forth in an unbiased way the actual deeds of those who figured conspicuously in that awful drama notes that the idea of a secretary of peace for the united states is no new thing was brought out in the course of a paper by p lee phillips read by president allen c clark before the columbia historical society which met at the shoreham hotel last night in the course of the paper entitled the negro benjamin banneker astronomer and mathematician it was brought out that banneker who was a free negro friend of washington and jefferson published a series of almanacs unique in that they were his own work throughout in the almanac for 1793 one of the articles from bannekers pen was a plan of peace office for the united states for promoting and preserving perpetual peace this article was concise and well written and contains most of the ideas set forth today by advocates of peace banneker took a crack at european military ideas and advocated the abolishment in the united states of military dress and titles and all militia laws he laid down laws for the construction of a great temple of peace

pickens of morgan college professor sherwood of la crosse wisconsin has for some time been making researches into paul cuffee an interesting comment dear sir it was very good of you to mail me a copy of the journal of negro history i had seen a copy of this publication i believe at the library of the institute of jamaica the second number is certainly an impressive issue indicative of the changed point of view the socalled literature on slavery and the negro is in the main rather a hindrance than a help the expression of mere personal opinion is of exceedingly slight value in the furtherance of any good cause what the world needs is not mere knowledge but a better understanding of the facts and experience already available when a race has reached a point where it realizes its own place in history and the value of a critical analysis of its historical experience a measurable advance has been made towards the attainment of a genuine progress all values are relative true history concerns itself with any and all achievements and not merely with political changes or military events most of the socalled historical disquisitions delivered annually before the american historical association fall seriously short in this respect ever since green wrote his first real history of the english people the oldtime historian has lost caste among men who are seriously concerned with the urgent solution of presentday problems unquestionably a true political history is of real value but the social history of mankind is infinitely more important the journal of negro history seems to meet the foregoing requirements for a social history of the negro race rather than a mere increase in the already voluminous socalled history of the political aspects of slavery reconstruction or reorganization during recent times the article on the negro soldier in the american revolution is excellent the prerequisite for a genuine race progress is race pride for this reason the past achievements of the negro in this or any other country individually or collectively are of the utmost teaching value it is a far cry apparently from the very recent high and well deserved promotion of a negro to a commanding position in the army back to the days of the service rendered by negro soldiers in the revolution but in its final analysis it is all a chain of connected events where so much has been done and is being achieved the outlook for the future must needs be encouraging progress is only made by struggling and the best results are those achieved against apparently insuperable difficulties race progress and race pride are practically equivalent terms individuals and races fail in proportion as they permit discouraging circumstances or conditions to control their destinies a true philosophy of history never fails to bring home the conviction that lasting success is attained only through the ages by persistent effort in the right direction the negro race has reason to be proud of its achievements but i am sure that the future progress will rest largely upon a better understanding of the negros place in history just as in the case of individuals so in the case of races it is first and last a question of finding our place in the world variation in type is absolutely essential to the highest development of the human species it is not therefore the duty of any one race to follow blindly in the footsteps of another it is for each race to seek for the best traits peculiarly its own and to leave absolutely nothing undone in season and out to develop those particular traits to the highest possible degree in other words it is not for the negro to try to be as near as he can to a white man even in his innermost thoughts and aspirations but to interpret the lessons of his own life through the philosophy of negro history and to be true to the moral and spiritual ideals of his race and his ancestors be they what they may very truly yours f l hoffman statistician

society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts among the negroes in the colonies the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts was organized in london in the year 1701 during the eighteenth century the british colonies of the new world constituted the principal field of missionary endeavor for this organization there were then in north america 250000 settlers whole colonies of whom were living in heathenism while others were adhering to almost every variety of strange faiths the work of proselyting these people was too important to be intrusted to individual enterprise and too extensive to be successfully prosecuted by the heads of the church only the ministrations of the established church were then limited to a few places in virginia new york maryland and the cities of boston and philadelphia to supply this deficiency the society endeavored to use missionaries as a direct means to convert the heathen of all races whether europeans indians or negroes there were cruel masters who objected to the conversion of their slaves1 but that any race should be denied the message of salvation because of its color was ever repudiated by the society from the very beginning of this work the conversion of the negroes was as important to the society as that of bringing the whites or the indians into the church such dignitaries of the church as rev thomas bacon and bishops fleetwood lowth sanderson and wilson ever urged this duty upon their brethren at home and abroad2 the first really effective work of the society was done in south carolina reverend mr thomas of goose creek parish in that state early instructed the indian and negro slaves of his vicinity he directed his attention to the negroes in 1695 and ten years later counted among his communicants twenty blacks who with several others well understanding the english tongue could read and write he further said in 1705 i have here presumed to give an account of one thousand slaves so far as they know of it and are desirous of christian knowledge and seem willing to prepare themselves for it in learning to read for which they redeem the time from their labor many of them can read the bible distinctly and great numbers of them were learning when i left the province3 this work however had not proceeded without much opposition the sentiment as to the enlightenment of the blacks was largely that of the youth who resolved never to go to the holy table while slaves were received there others felt like the lady who inquired is it possible that any of my slaves should go to heaven and must i see them there4 the earnest workers sent out by the society however did not cease to labor in behalf of the negroes and the number of masters willing to have their slaves instructed gradually increased among these liberal owners were john morris of st bartholomews lady moore captain david davis mrs sarah baker at goose creek landgrave joseph morton and his wife of st pauls the governor and a member of the assembly mr and mrs skeen5 mrs haigue and mrs edwards so successful were the efforts of mrs haigue and mrs edwards that they were formally thanked by the society for their care and good example in instructing the negroes of whom no less than twentyseven prepared by them including those of another planter were baptized by the reverend e taylor of st andrews within two years6 other less liberal masters refused to allow their slaves to attend mr taylor for instruction but some of them were induced to teach the blacks the lords prayer the result even from this was so successful that there came to the church more negroes than could be accommodated so great was their desire for instruction that had it not been for the opposition of their owners almost all of them would have been converted so far as the missionaries were permitted says one they did all that was possible for their evangelization and while so many professed christians among the planters were lukewarm it pleased god to raise to himself devout servants among the heathen whose faithfulness was commended by the masters themselves in some of the congregations the negroes or blacks constituted one half of the communicants7 this interest of the clergy in the negroes of south carolina continued in spite of opposition rev mr guy of st andrews parish said that he baptized a negro man and a negro woman in 1723 and rev mr hunt minister of st johns parish reported in that same year that a slave a sensible negro who can read and write and comes to church is a catechumen under probation for baptism which he desires8 a new impetus too was given the movement about 1740 influenced by such urgent addresses as those of dr brearcroft and bishops gibson wilson and seeker the workers of the society were aroused to proselyting more extensively among the negroes in 1741 the bishop of canterbury expressed his gratification at the large number of negroes who were then being brought into the church9 a decided step forward was noted in 1743 that year a school for negroes was opened by commissary garden and placed in charge of harry and andrew two colored youths who had been trained as teachers at the cost of the society this establishment was a sort of training school for bright young blacks who felt called to instruct their fellow countrymen for adults who labored during the day it was an evening school it was successfully conducted for more than twenty years in 1763 the institution was for some unknown reason closed after being conducted in the face of many difficulties and obstructions although this was the only educational institution in that colony for its 50000 blacks10 some good results were obtained by the missionaries of the society of north carolina but difficulties were also encountered there the chief trouble seems to have been that missionaries of that colony were frustrated by the slave owners who would by no means permit their negroes to be baptized having a false notion that a christened slave is by law free11 by much importunity says an investigator mr ransford of chowan in 1712 prevailed on mr martin to let him baptize three of his negroes two women and a boy all the arguments i could make use of said he would scarce effect it till bishop fleetwoods sermon in 1711 turned ye scale12 mr rumford succeeded however in baptizing upwards of forty negroes in one year in the course of time when the workers overcame the prejudice of the masters a missionary would sometimes baptize fifteen to twentyfour in a month forty to fifty in six months and sixty to seventy in a year13 reverend mr newman a minister in north carolina reported in 1723 that he had baptized two negroes who could say the creed the lords prayer the ten commandments and gave good sureties for their further information14 according to the report of rev c hall the number of conversions there among negroes for eight years was 355 including 112 adults and at edenton the blacks generally were induced to attend service at all these stations where they behaved with great decorum15 in the middle and southern colonies these missionaries had the cooperation of dr thomas bray in 1696 he was sent to maryland by the bishop of london to do what he could toward the conversion of adult negroes and the education of their children16 brays most influential supporter was m dalone the private secretary of king william dalone gave for the maintenance of the cause a fund the proceeds of which were first used to employ catechists and later to support the thomas bray mission after the catechists had failed to give satisfaction at the death of this missionary the task was taken up by certain of his followers known as the associates of dr bray17 they extended their work beyond the bounds of maryland these benefactors maintained two schools for the benefit of negroes in philadelphia about the close of the french and indian war rev mr stewart a missionary in north carolina found there a school for the education of indians and negroes conducted by dr brays associates18 georgia too was not neglected the extension of the work of dr brays associates into the colony made an opening there for taking up the instruction of negroes the society joined with these workers for supporting a schoolmaster for negroes in 1751 and an improvement in the slaves was soon admitted by their owners19 in 1766 rev s frink a missionary toiling in augusta found that he could neither convert the indians nor the whites who seemed to be as destitute of religion as the former but succeeded in converting some negroes20 in pennsylvania the missionary movement found less obstacles to the conversion of negroes than to that of the indians in fact the proselyting of negroes in the colony was less difficult than in some other parts of america the reports of the missionaries show that slaves were being baptized there as early as 171221 about this time a mr yeates of chester was commended by the rev g ross for his endeavors to train up the negroes in the knowledge of religion22 moved by the appeal of the bishop of london other masters permitted the indoctrination of their slaves in the principles of christianity at philadelphia the rev g ross baptized on one occasion 12 adult negroes who were examined before the congregation and answered to the admiration of all who heard them the like sight had never been seen before in that church23 rev mr beckett minister in sussex county pennsylvania said in 1723 that he had admitted two negro slaves and that many negroes constantly attended his services24 the same year rev mr bartow baptized a negro at west chester25 rev mr pugh a missionary at appoquinimmick pennsylvania said in a letter written to the society in 1737 that he had received a few blacks and that the masters of the negroes were prejudiced against their being christians26 rev richard locke christened eight negroes in one family at lancaster in 1747 and another negro there the following year26a in 1774 the rev mr jenney reported that there was a great and daily increase of negroes in this city who would with joy attend upon a catechist for instruction that he had baptized several but was unable to add to his other duties and the society ever ready to lend a helping hand to such pious undertakings appointed the rev w sturgeon as catechist for the negroes at philadelphia27 the next to show diligence in the branch of the work of the society was mr neill of dover he baptized as many as 162 within 18 months28 the operations of the society did not seem to cover a large part of new jersey the rev mr lindsay wrote of the baptizing of a negro at allerton in 173629 the reports from the missions of new brunswick show that a large number of negroes had attached themselves to the church this condition however did not obtain in all parts of that colony yet subsequent reports show that the missionary spirit was not wanting in that section the baptism of black children and the accession of negro adults to the church were from time to time reported from that field30 the most effective work of the society among negroes of the northern colonies was accomplished in new york in that colony the instruction of the negro and indian slaves to prepare them for conversion baptism and communion was a primary charge oft repeated to every missionary and schoolmaster of the society in addition to the general efforts put forth in the colonies there was in new york a special provision for the employment of sixteen clergymen and thirteen lay teachers mainly for the evangelization of the slaves and the free indians for the negro slaves a catechizing school was opened in new york city in 1704 under the charge of elias neau this benevolent man after several years imprisonment because of his protestant faith had come to new york to try his fortunes as a trader as early as 1703 he called the attention of the society to the great number of slaves in new york who were without god in the world and of whose souls there was no manner of care taken31 and proposed the appointment of a catechist to undertake their instruction he himself finally being prevailed upon to accept this position obtained a license from the governor resigned his position as elder in the french church and conformed to the established church of england not upon any worldly account but through a principle of conscience and hearty approbation of the english liturgy32 he was later licensed by the bishop of london neaus task was not an easy one at first he went from house to house but afterwards arranged for some of the slaves to attend him he succeeded however in obtaining gratifying results he was commended to the society by rev mr vesey in 1706 as a constant communicant of our church and a most zealous and prudent servant of christ in proselyting the miserable negroes and indians among them to the christian religion whereby he does great service to god and his church33 further confidence in him was attested by an act of the society in preparing at his request a bill to be offered to parliament for the more effectual conversion of the negro and other servants in the plantations to compell owners of slaves to cause children to be baptized within 3 months after their birth and to permit them when come to years of discretion to be instructed in the christian religion on our lords day by the missionaries under whose ministry they live34 neaus school suffered greatly in 1712 because of the prejudice engendered by the declaration that instruction was the main cause of the negro riot in that city for some days neau dared not show himself so bitter was the feeling of the masters upon being assured however that only one negro connected with the school had participated in the affair and that the most criminal belonged to the masters who were openly opposed to educating them the institution was permitted to continue its endeavors and the governor extended to it his protection and recommended that masters have their slaves instructed35 yet neau had still to complain thereafter of the struggle and opposition of the generality of the inhabitants who were strongly prejudiced with a horrid motive thinking that christian knowledge would be a means to make the slave more cunning and apter to wickedness36 not so long thereafter however the support of the best people and officials of the community made his task easier neau could say in 1714 that if the slaves and domestics in new york were not instructed it was not his fault37 the governor the council mayor the recorder and the chief justice informed the society that neau had performed his work to the great advancement of religion in general and the particular benefit of the free indians negro slaves and other heathens in those parts with indefatigable zeal and application38 neau died in 1722 his work was carried on by mr huddlestone rev mr whitmore rev mr colgan rev r charlton and rev s auchmutty from 1732 to 1740 mr charlton baptized 219 slaves and frequently thereafter the number admitted yearly was from 40 to 6039 the great care exercised in preparing slaves for the church was rewarded by the spiritual knowledge which in some cases was such as might have put to shame many persons who had had greater advantages rev mr auchmutty who served from 1747 to 1764 reported that there was among the negroes an everincreasing desire for instruction and not one single black that had been admitted by him to the holy communion had turned out bad or been in any shape a disgrace to our holy profession40 the interest in the enlightenment of negroes too extended also to other parts of the colony in 1737 rev mr stoupe wrote of baptizing four black children at new rochelle41 mr charlton had taken upon himself at new windsor the task of instructing these unfortunates before he entered upon the work in new york city at staten island too he found it both practical and convenient to throw into one the classes of his white and black catechumens42 rev charles taylor a schoolmaster at that place kept a night school for the instruction of negroes and of such as could not be spared from their work in the day time43 rev j sayre of newburgh followed the same plan of coeducation of the races in each of the four churches under his charge44 rev t barclay an earnest worker among the slaves in albany reported in 1714 a great forwardness among them to embrace christianity and a readiness to receive instruction45 he found much opposition among certain masters chief among whom were major m schuyler and his brotherinlaw petrus vandroffen sixty years later came the report from schenectady that there were still to be found several negro slaves of whom 11 were sober serious communicants46 these missionaries met with more opposition than encouragement in new england the puritan had no serious objection to seeing the negroes saved but when the conversion meant the incorporation of the undesirable class into the state then so closely connected with the church many new englanders became silent this opposition however was not effective everywhere from bristol rev j usher wrote in 1730 that several negroes desired baptism and were able to render a very good account of the hope that was in them but he was forbidden by their masters to comply with the request yet he reported the same year that among others he had in his congregation about 30 negroes and indians most of whom joined in the public service very decently47 at newtown where greater opposition was encountered rev j beach seemed to have baptized by 1733 many indians and a few negroes48 the rev dr cutler a missionary at boston wrote to the society in 1737 that among those he had admitted to his church were four negro slaves49 endeavoring to do more than to effect nominal conversions doctor johnson while at stratford had catechetical lectures during the summer months of 1751 attended by many negroes and some indians as well as whites about 70 or 80 in all and said he as far as i can find where the dissenters have baptized 2 if not 3 or 4 negroes or indians i have four or five communicants50 dr macsparran conducted at narragansett a class of 70 indians and negroes whom he frequently catechized and instructed before the regular service51 rev j honyman of newport had in his congregation more than 100 negroes who constantly attended the publick worship52 it appears then that the negroes were instructed by the missionaries in all of the colonies except some remote parts of new england virginia and maryland the established church had workers among the white persons in those colonies but they did not always direct their attention to the slaves this does not mean however that the slaves in those parts were entirely neglected there were at work other agencies to bring them to the light and so on it continued until the

the poor heathens here and more especially of the negro and indian slaves in my own parish which i hope i can truly say i have been sincerely and earnestly endeavoring ever since i was a minister here where there are many negro and indian slaves in a most pitifull deplorable and perishing condition tho little pitied by many of their masters and their conversion and salvation little desired and endeavored by them if the masters were but good christians themselves and would but concurre with the ministers we should then have good hopes of the conversion and salvation at least of some of their

cannot but honour madame haigue in my parish a very considerable number of negroes were very loose and wicked and little inclined to christianity before her coming among them i cant but honor her so much as to acquaint the society with the extraordinary pains this gentle woman and one madm edwards that came with her have taken to instruct those negroes in the principles of the christian religion and to instruct and reform them and the wonderful successe they have met with in about a half a years time in this great and good work upon these gentle womens desiring me to come and examine these

and i desired them to rehearse the apostles creed and the ten commandments and the lords prayer which they did very distinctly and perfectly 14 of them gave me so great satisfaction and were so very

people of color in louisiana part i the title of a possible discussion of the negro in louisiana presents difficulties for there is no such word as negro permissible in speaking of this state the history of the state is filled with attempts to define sometimes at the point of the sword oftenest in civil or criminal courts the meaning of the word negro by common consent it came to mean in louisiana prior to 1865 slave and after the war those whose complexions were noticeably dark as grace king so delightfully puts it the pureblooded african was never called colored but always negro the gens de couleur colored people were always a class apart separated from and superior to the negroes ennobled were it only by one drop of white blood in their veins the caste seems to have existed from the first introduction of slaves to the whites all africans who were not of pure blood were gens de couleur among themselves however there were jealous and fiercelyguarded distinctions griffes briqus mulattoes quadroons octoroons each term meaning one degrees further transfiguration toward the caucasian standard of physical perfection1 negro slavery in louisiana seems to have been early influenced by the policy of the spanish colonies de las casas an apostle to the indians exclaimed against the slavery of the indians and finding his efforts of no avail proposed to charles v in 1517 the slavery of the africans as a substitute2 the spaniards refused at first to import slaves from africa but later agreed to the proposition and employed other nations to traffic in them3 louisiana learned from the spanish colonies her lessons of this traffic took over certain parts of the slave regulations and imported bondmen from the spanish west indies others brought thither were congo banbara yaloff and mandingo slaves4 people of color were introduced into louisiana early in the eighteenth century in 1708 according to the historian gayarr the little colony of louisiana at the point on the gulf of mexico now known as biloxi in the present state of mississippi had been in existence nine years in 1708 the population of the colony did not exceed 279 persons the land about this region is particularly sterile and the colonists were little disposed to undertake the laborious task of tilling the soil indian slavery was attempted but found unprofitable and exceedingly precarious so bienville lacking the sympathy of de las casas for the indians wrote his government to obtain the authorization of exchanging negroes for indians with the french west indian islands we shall give he said three indians for two negroes the indians when in the islands will not be able to run away the country being unknown to them and the negroes will not dare to become fugitives in louisiana because the indians would kill them5 bienvilles suggestion seems not to have met with a very favorable reception yet in 1712 the king of france granted to anthony crozat the exclusive privilege for fifteen years of trading in all that immense territory which with its undefined limits france claimed as louisiana among other privileges granted crozat were those of sending once a year a ship to africa for negroes6 when the first came is not known but in 1713 twenty of these negro slaves from africa are recorded in the census of the little colony on the mississippi7 in 1717 john law flashed meteorwise across the world with his huge scheme to finance france out of difficulty with his mississippi bubble among other considerations mentioned in the charter for twentyfive years which he obtained from the gullible french government was the stipulation that before the expiration of the charter he must transport to louisiana six thousand white persons and three thousand negroes not to be brought from another french colony these slaves so said the charter were to be sold to those inhabitants who had been two years in the colony for one half cash and the balance on one years credit the new inhabitants had one or two years credit granted them8 in the first year the law company transported from africa one thousand slaves in 1720 five hundred the same number the next march and by 1721 the pages of legal enactments in the west indies were being ransacked for precedents in dealing with this strange population but of all these slaves who came to the colony by june 1721 but six hundred remained many had died some had been exported in 1722 therefore the mississippi company was under constraint to pass an edict prohibiting the inhabitants of louisiana from selling their slaves for transportation out of the colony to the spaniards or to any other foreign nation under the penalty of the fine of a thousand livres and the confiscation of the negroes9 but already the curse of slavery had begun to show its effects the new colony was not immoral it may best be described as unmoral indolence on the part of the masters was physical mental and moral the slave population began to lighten in color and increase out of all proportion to the importation and natural breeding among themselves la harpe comments in 1724 upon the astonishing diminution of the white population and the astounding increase of the colored population10 something was undoubtedly wrong according to the caucasian standard and it has remained wrong to our own day11 the person of color was now in louisiana a part of its social system a creature to be legislated for and against a person lending his dark shade to temper the inartistic complexion of his white master now he began to make history and just as the trail of his color persisted in the complexion of louisiana so the trail of his personal influence continued in the history of the colony the territory and the state bienville the man of farreaching vision saw the danger menacing the colony and before his recall and disgrace before the french court he published in 1724 the famous black code12 this code followed the order of that of the west indies but contains some provisions to meet local needs the legal status of the slave was that of movable property of his master children born of negro parents followed the condition of their mother slaves were forbidden to carry weapons slaves of different masters could not assemble in crowds by day or night they were not permitted to sell commodities provisions or produce without permission from their masters and had no property which did not belong to their masters neither freeborn blacks nor slaves were allowed to receive gifts from whites they could not exercise such public functions as arbitrator or expert could not be partners to civil or criminal suits could not give testimony except in default of white people and could never testify against their masters if a slave struck his master or one of the family so as to produce a bruise or shedding blood in the face he had to be put to death any runaway slave who continued to be so from the day his master denounced him suffered the penalty of having his ears cut off and being branded on his shoulder with a fleurdelis for a second offence the penalty was to hamstring the fugitive and brand him on the other shoulder for the third such offence he suffered death freed or freeborn negroes who gave refuge to fugitive slaves had to pay 30 livres for each day of retention and other free persons 10 livres a day if the freed or freeborn negroes were not able to pay the fine they could be reduced to the condition of slaves and sold as such the slaves were socially ostracized marriage of whites with slaves was forbidden as was also the concubinage of whites and manumitted or freeborn blacks with slaves the consent of the parents of a slave to his marriage was not required that of the master was sufficient but a slave could not be forced to marry against his will there were however somewhat favorable provisions which made this code seem a little less rigorous the slaves had to be well fed and the masters could not force them to provide for themselves by working for their own account certain days of the week and slaves could give information against their owners if not properly fed or clothed disabled slaves had to be sent to the hospital husbands wives and their children under the age of puberty could not be seized and sold separately when belonging to the same master the code forbade the application of the rack to slaves under any pretext on private authority or mutilation of a limb under penalty of confiscation of the slave and criminal prosecution of the master the master was allowed however to have his slave put in irons and whipped with rods or ropes the code commanded officers or justices to prosecute masters and overseers who should kill or mutilate slaves and to punish the murder according to the atrocity of the circumstance other provisions were still more favorable the slaves had to be instructed in the catholic religion slaves appointed by their masters as tutors to their children were held set free moreover manumitted slaves enjoyed the same rights privileges and immunities that were enjoyed by those born free it is our pleasure reads the document that their merit in having acquired their freedom shall produce in their favor not only with regard to their persons but also to their property the same effects that our other subjects derive from the happy circumstance of their having been born free13 from the first appearance of the gens de couleur in the colony of louisiana dates the class the gens de couleur libres the record of the legal tangles which resulted from the attempts to define this race in louisiana is most interesting up to 1671 all creoles mulattoes free negroes etc paid a capitation tax in february 12 of that year m de baas governorgeneral of martinique issued an order exempting the creoles those mulattoes who were also designated as creoles claimed the same exemption and resisted paying the tax m patoulet intendent rendered a decision in 1683 and said the mulattoes and free negroes claimed to be exempt from the capitation tax i have made them pay without difficulty i decide that those mulattoes born in vice should not receive the exemption and that for the free negro the master could give him freedom but could not give him the exemption that attaches to the whites originally from france14 the next year the mulattoes refused to pay and the successor of minister patoulet m michel begou asked for a law to compel them15 in 1696 an agreement was reached exempting the mulattoes and creoles leaving only the free black subject to the tax16 but in 1712 a m robert in a decision on a subject again included the mulattoes without however mentioning the creoles so that only the free negroes and mulattoes paid17 thus they were held as a class apart a free negro woman magdelaine debern further contested the matter and in 1724 in the colony of louisiana won a decision exempting free negroes and mulattoes and again placing them on the same footing with the creole the creoles had a decided advantage however because through the favor of those in authority there was always a disposition to exalt them18 it is in the definition of the word creole that another great difficulty arises the native white louisianian will tell you that a creole is a white man whose ancestors contain some french or spanish blood in their veins but he will be disputed by others who will gravely tell you that creoles are to be found only in the lower delta lands of the state that there are no creoles north of new orleans and will raise their hands in horror at the idea of being confused with the cajans the descendants of those nova scotians whom longfellow immortalized in evangeline sifting down the mass of conflicting definitions it appears that to a caucasian a creole is a native of the lower parishes of louisiana in whose veins some traces of spanish west indian or french blood runs19 the caucasian will shudder with horror at the idea of including a person of color in the definition and the person of color will retort with his definition that a creole is a native of louisiana in whose blood runs mixed strains of everything unamerican with the african strain slightly apparent the true creole is like the famous gumbo of the state a little bit of everything making a whole delightfully flavored quite distinctive and wholly unique from 1724 to the present time frequent discussions as to the proper name by which to designate this very important portion of the population of louisiana waged more or less acrimoniously20 it was this creole element who in 1763 obtained a decision from louis xv that all mixed bloods who could claim descent from an indian ancestor in addition to a white outranked those mixed bloods who had only white and african ancestors21 in jamaica in 1733 there was passed a law that every person who could show that he was three degrees removed from a negro ancestor should be regarded as belonging to the white race and could sit as a member of the jamaica assembly22 in barbadoes any person who had a white ancestor could vote these laws were quoted in louisiana and influenced legislation there23 gov perier succeeded bienville as governor of louisiana his task was not a light one the colony staggered under terror of attack from the indians sudden alarms false hopes anxious suspense militia levies colonial paper instead of good money industrial stagnation the care of homeless refugees and worst of all the restiveness of the slaves the bad effects of slaveholding began to show themselves many of the slaves had been taken in war and were fierce and implacable some were of that fiercest of african tribes the banbaras a friendliness born of common hatred and despair began to show itself between the colored people and the fierce choctaw indians surrounding the colony when gov perier planned a masterstroke of diplomacy just above new orleans lived a small tribe of indians the chouchas who not particularly harmful in themselves had succeeded in inspiring the nervous inhabitants of the city with abject fear perier armed a band of slaves in 1729 and sent them to the chouchas with instructions to exterminate the tribe they did their work with an ease and dispatch that should have been a warning to their white masters in reporting the success of his plan perier said the negroes executed their mission with as much promptitude as secrecy this lesson taught them by our negroes kept in check all the nations higher up the river24 thus by one stroke the wily governor had intimidated the tribes of indians allayed the nervous fears of new orleans and effected a state of hostility between the indians and the africans who were beginning to be entirely too friendly with each other then perier used the slaves to make the entrenchments about the city thus we have the first instance of the arming of the negro in louisiana for the defense of the colony on the 15th of january 1730 gov perier sent a boat containing twenty white men and six africans to carry ammunition to the illinois settlement up the mississippi river whence tales of massacre and cruelty by the indians filtered down25 the arming of the slaves in defense of the whites gave impetus to the struggle for their own freedom in the massacre of the french by the natchez at the village of that name over three hundred women and slaves were kept as prisoners and in january of the same year which witnessed the massacre of the chouchas the french surprised the natchez indians with the intention of recovering their women and slaves and avenging the death of their comrades some of the africans who had been promised their freedom if they allied themselves with the natchez indians fought against their erstwhile masters others were loyal and helped the french the battle became an issue as it were between the slaves over one hundred of them were recovered from the indians26 the first tribute we have paid to the black man as a soldier in louisiana was paid by gov perier in this war in his dispatch to the french government fifteen negroes he wrote in whose hands we had put weapons performed prodigies of valor if the blacks did not cost so much and if their labors were not so necessary to the colony it would be better to turn them into soldiers and to dismiss those we have who are so bad and so cowardly that they seem to have been manufactured purposely for this colony27 but the tiger had tasted blood periers cruel logic was reactionary since he had used blacks to murder indians in order to make bad blood between the races the indians retaliated by using blacks to murder white men in august of that same fateful year the chickasaws who had given asylum to the despoiled natchez in order to curb the encroachments of the white men stirred the black slaves to revolt we have noted before the prevalence of the banbara negroes in the colony it was they who planned the rebellion their plan was after having butchered the whites to establish a banbara colony keeping as slaves for themselves all blacks not of their nation the conspiracy was discovered by the hints of a woman in the revolt before it had time to ripen and the head of the revolt a powerful black named samba with eight of his confederates was broken on the wheel and the woman hanged28 gov periers administration did not lack interest the next year in 1731 we find him still struggling with his old enemies the natchez his dispatches mention that a crew under one de coulanges with indians and free blacks had been massacred by the indians one dispatch has the greatest interest for us because of the expression free blacks29 used here is one of the great mysteries of the person of color in louisiana whence the free black we are told explicitly that up to this time all negroes imported into louisiana were slaves from africa for the west indian migration did not occur until a half century later this dispatch from gov perier recalls articles in the black code of 1724 where explicit directions are given for the disposition of the children of free blacks in the regulations of police under the governorship of the marquis of vandreuil 1750 there is an article regulating the attitude of free negroes and negresses toward slaves here is the very beginning of that aristocracy of freedom so fiercely and jealously guarded until this day a free person of color being set as far above his slave fellows as the white man sets himself above the person of color three explanations for this aristocracy seem highly probable some slaves might have been freed by their masters because of valor on the battlefield others by buying their freedom in terms of money and not a few slave women by their owners because of their personal attractions it makes little difference in this story which of the three or whether all of the three were contributors to the rise of this new class it existed as early as 1724 twelve years after the first recorded slave importation it was in 1766 that some acadians complaining of their treatment to the governor ulloa represented that negroes were freemen while they were slaves bienville returned to the colony as its governor in 1733 after an absence of eight years and it is recorded that in 1735 when he reviewed his troops near mobile while making preparations for an indian war he found that his army from new orleans consisted of five hundred and fortyfour white men excluding the officers and fortyfive negroes commanded by free blacks30 here we note free black officers of negro troops in 1735 if not actually the first regular negro troops to appear in what is now the united states they were certainly the first to be commanded by negro officers the engagement with the choctaw indians was not altogether successful for the french disaster succeeded disaster and the day closed with the french army deeply humiliated and making a retreat as dignified as possible under the circumstances a number of the french officers as gayarr tells us stood under the shade of a gigantic oak discussing the defeat and with them simon a free black the commander of the troop of negroes he was deeply vexed because his troops had not stood fire and expressed himself with so much freedom and disgust that the french officers kept bantering him without mercy at the timidity of his soldiers soothing their own wounded pride by laughing at his mortification stung to the heart simon finally exclaimed wrathfully a negro is as brave as anybody and i will show it to you seizing a rope which was dangling from one of the tents he rushed headlong toward one of the horses which were quietly slaking their thirst under the protection of the indian muskets to reach a white mare to jump on her back with the agility of a tiger and to twist around her head and mouth the rope with which to control her was the affair of an instant but that instant was enough for the apparently sleeping indian village to show itself awake and to flash forth into a hail of bullets away dashed simon toward the indian village and back to the french camp where he arrived safe amid the cheering acclamations of the troops and without having received a wound from the shots of the enemy31 this feat silenced at once the jests of the french officers of which simon thought himself the victim32 the beginning of the revolutionary war in 1776 found louisiana a spanish province and the natives of the colony beginning to tolerate and even to like their erstwhile hated spanish masters don bernardo de galvez was governor of the colony his administration has a peculiar interest to us because it was during his rule that the court of madrid fully alive to the policy of extending the agriculture of louisiana issued a decree permitting the introduction of negroes into louisiana by french vessels from whatever ports they might come33 this was the beginning of the rapid migration from the west indian islands while andrew jackson was still a child louisiana had a deliverer from the british in the person of this brave gov galvez the strategical importance of the mississippi river and of new orleans was at once apparent to the british commanders and louisiana being neutral territory offered a most fascinating field of operation galvez in july 1777 had secured declaration of neutrality from the 25000 or more creeks choctaws and chickasaws but even this did not seem to satisfy the combatants new orleans was at the mercy of first the american troops and then the british the mediation of spain between france and england having been rejected in the courts of europe spain decided to join france in the struggle against great britain so on may 8 1779 spain formally declared war against great britain and on july 8 authorized all spanish subjects in america to take their share in the hostilities against the english no news could be more welcome to the dashing young galvez to whom a policy of neutrality was decidedly distasteful he decided to forestall the attack on new orleans which he had learned was to be made by the british by attacking first and on august 26 gathered his little army together from new orleans as gayarr tells were 170 veteran soldiers 330 recruits 20 carabiniers 60 militiamen and 80 free blacks and mulattoes on the way up the river they were reinforced by 600 men from the coast of every condition and color besides 160 indians34 on the march the colored men and indians were ordered to keep ahead of the main body of troops at a distance of about three quarters of a mile and closely to reconnoitre the woods in capturing the two forts of baton rouge and natchez which were held by the british galvez found a considerable number of negro slaves who had been armed by the british many of these he set free in his dispatch to his government at madrid galvez reports that the companies of free blacks and mulattoes who had been employed in all the false attacks and who as scouts and skirmishers had proved exceedingly useful behaved on all occasions with as much valor and generosity as the white soldiers35 but not alone were the exploits of galvezs little army celebrated in history poetry added her laurel wreath to its crown julien poydras de lalande known to all louisianians as poydras celebrated the victory in a poem the god of the mississippi wherein the brave deeds of the army white and colored are hailed in french verse lame and halting it may be in places but impartial in its tribute the close of the revolutionary war found the colony partially paralyzed as to industry during the spanish domination the indigo industry declined tobacco was difficult to raise and the production of cotton was not then profitable sugar raising was the only other industry to which they could turn in 1751 the jesuit fathers had received their first seed or rather layers from santo domingo and from that time sugarcane had been grown with more or less success but it was a strictly local industry the louisianians were poor sugarmakers the stuff was badly granulated and very moist and when in 1765 an effort was made to export some of the sugar to france it was so wet that half of the cargo leaked out of the ship before it could make port it was just at this psychological moment in 1791 to 1794 when the planters of the lower delta saw ruin staring them in the face that there came to the rescue of the colony a man of color one of the refugees from santo domingo where the blacks had risen in 1791 from the failure of this abortive attempt to emulate the spirit of the white man refugees flew in every direction and louisiana welcomed them if not exactly with open arms at least with more indifference than other colonies and these black refugees were her saviors for they had been prosperous sugarmakers and the efforts to make marketable sugar in louisiana which had ceased for nearly twentyfive years were revived two spaniards mendez and solis erected on the outskirts of new orleans the one a distillery the other a battery of sugarkettles and manufactured rum and syrup still the efforts were not entirely successful until etienne de bor appeared face to face with ruin because of the failure of the indigo crop he staked his all on the granulation of sugar he enlisted the services of these successful santo dominicans and went to work in all american history there can be fewer scenes more dramatic than the one described by careful historians of louisiana the day when the final test was made and there was passed around the electrical word it granulates36 that year de bor marketed 12000 worth of super or sugar the agriculture of the delta was revolutionized seven years afterwards new orleans marketed 2000000 gallons of rum 250000 gallons of molasses and 5000000 pounds of sugar it was the beginning of the commercial importance of one of the most progressive cities in the country imagination refuses to picture what would have been the case but for the refugees from san domingo but the same revolution which gave to louisiana its prestige to the commercial world almost starved the province to death in the year 1791 the trade which had flourished briskly between santo domingo and new orleans was closed because of the uprising and but for philadelphia famine would have decimated the city 1000 barrels of flour were sent in haste to the starving city by the good quakers of philadelphia the members of the cabildo the local council prohibited the introduction of people of color from santo domingo fearing the dangerous ideas of the brotherhood of man but it was too late the news of the success of the slaves in santo domingo and the success of the french revolution says gayarr had penetrated into the most remote cabins of louisiana and in april 1795 on the plantation of the same poydras who had sung the glory of the army of galvez a conspiracy was formed for a general uprising of the slaves throughout the parish of pointe coupe the leaders were three white men the conspiracy failed because one of the leaders was incensed at his advice not being heeded and through his wife the authorities were notified a struggle ensued and the conspiracy was strangled in its infancy by the trial and execution of the slaves most concerned in the insurrection the three white men were exiled from the colony37 this finally ended the importation of slaves from the west indies alice dunbarnelson footnotes 1 king new orleans the

litigation on the subject of the definition of the free person of color reached its climax in the year of our lord 1909 when judge frank d chretien defined the word negro as differentiated from person of color as used in louisiana the case as it was argued in court was briefly this it was charged that one treadway a white man was living in illegal relations with an octoroon josephine lightell the district attorney claimed that any one having a trace of african blood in his veins however slight should be classed as a negro counsel for the defence had taken the position that josephine lightell had so little negro blood in her veins that she could not be classed as one judge chretien held in his ruling that local opinion custom and sentiment had previously agreed in holding that the black and not the white blood settled the ethnological status of each person and that an octoroon no less than a quadroon and a mulatto had been considered a negro but he held that if the caucasian wished to be considered the superior race and that if his blood be considered the superior element in the infusion then the caucasian and not the negro blood must determine the status of a person the case went to the supreme court of louisiana on an appeal from the decision of judge chretien who held that a mulatto is not a negro in legal parlance the supreme court in a decision handed down april 25

saxony the objective point between prussia and austria in the seven years war directing special attention to kentucky requires some explanation the possession of this commonwealth was for several reasons more important than that of some other border states the transportation facilities afforded by the cumberland and tennessee rivers furnished the key to carrying out the plan to divide the south the possession of the state by the confederates was of strategic importance for the invasion of the north too for the reason that the ordinance of 1787 had been so interpreted as to fix the boundary of kentucky on the north side of the ohio river it was moreover the native state of abraham lincoln and it was important to have that commonwealth support this untrained backwoodsman whom most statesmen considered incapable of administering the affairs of the nation in the beginning the situation was not the least encouraging to the unionists the breckenridge democrats had carried the state in 1859 on a platform favoring southern rights their chief spokesman had become such a defender of their faith that in 1860 he was chosen to lead the radically proslavery party which had come to the point of so doubting the orthodoxy of their northern adherents as to deem it advisable to separate from them unalterably in favor of the rights of the slave states the leaders of this persuasion had expressed themselves in terms that could not be misunderstood1 one of their spokesmen humphrey marshall contended that slavery is not a creature of municipal law he believed that the institution followed the flag he wanted union but only with that equality which involved the recognition of the right of property in slaves everywhere2 speaking in the house of representatives on january 30 1861 john w stephenson another of this faction said on the same topic equality underlaid the whole federal structure and protection to persons and property within the federal jurisdiction was the price of allegiance of the states to such general government as delegated and prescribed in the constitution wherever the american banner floated upon the seas or land all beneath it was entitled to the protection of the flag3 on this question their leader john c breckenridge a believer in the old democratic creed and a supporter of the south and her institutions4 took the same if not higher ground referring to the dred scott decision in a speech delivered in ashland kentucky in 1859 breckenridge said after this decision we had arrived at a point where we might reasonably expect tranquillity and peace the equality of rights and property of all the states in the common territory having been stamped by the seal of judicial authority all good citizens might well acquiesce5 when the southern states seceded because of the threatened infringement of these rights the president of the united states according to breckenridge had no right to enlist men and no right to blockade the southern ports in short no right to wage war on these commonwealths lincoln had thus overthrown constitutional government if he was trying to preserve the union he must do it in a constitutional way breckenridge wanted the union but contended that it would be no good without the constitution6 to sum up as southern democrats they had helped to disrupt the charleston convention and developing into a strict southern rights party they had through bolting made possible the election of abraham lincoln they then finally joined the states rights party which boldly declaring the election of lincoln a just cause for the dissolution of the union undertook to secede7 with such radical leaders in control it might seem strange that in a state formed from an aristocratic commonwealth like virginia and extending into the fertile region of the mississippi these protagonists of states rights did not turn kentucky over to the confederacy exactly what part did the rich slaveholders play during this crisis when the state was called upon to decide the question between the north and south what was the position of such influential men as james b clay george b hodge cerro gordo williams t p porter roger w hansom and s b buckner8 other representative citizens however had been equally outspoken in favor of the union voicing the sentiment of the union party which on the eighth of january met in louisville to take steps to support the federal government bell said let us offer everything we can to avert the torrent of evil but let us always stand ready to support our rights in the union the state is deeply and devotedly attached to the union9 garrett davis inquired will you preserve the union or rush into the vortex of revolution under the name of secession10 j t boyle said in the same convention that there could be no benefit or advantage no civil or political rights no interest of any kind whatever secured by government in the southern confederacy which the people did not then enjoy in the blessed union formed by our fathers in his opinion it was the duty of kentuckians to stand by the star spangled banner and cling to the union11 some of the most influential newspapers were fearlessly advocating the union cause among others were the frankfort daily commonwealth the louisville courier and the democrat exactly what support these leaders of the differing factions would obtain was determined by forces for centuries at work in that state southerners who thought that because kentucky was a slave state it should go with the south had failed to take these causes into consideration in the first place not every slaveholder was an ardent proslavery agitator there were masters who like henry clay considered slavery an evil and hoped to see it abolished but while the majority of their fellow countrymen held on to it they did so too many kentuckians moreover were like that restless class of westerners who dissatisfied with the society based on slavery had taken up land beyond the mountains where the poor man could toil up from poverty12 kentucky was the first section west of the allegheny mountains settled by these daring adventurers because they were there cut off from the north by the french and from the south by the spanish and in kentucky a section hemmed in by these foreign possessions the settlers were less liable to be disturbed and even when the barrier of foreign claims had been removed the movement of population from the east to the west took place along lines leading to the states later organized in the west rather than into kentucky the people of kentucky therefore were not radically changed in a day by the influx of population on the contrary many of them especially the mountaineers have not changed since the days of boone and henderson some of them having left the uplands of the colonies because they were handicapped by slavery were naturally opposed to the bold claims of that institution in 1861 they like the westerners learned to look to the general government for the establishment of commonwealths the building of forts and the maintenance of troops13 and therefore adhered to it when it was threatened with destruction another cause moreover was equally as potential in kentucky as in some other southern states there had grown up a considerable number of prosperous country towns where resided lawyers merchants bankers teachers and mechanics who had little property interest in slavery who felt their own intellectual superiority to the country squires and their foxhunting horseracing quarrelsome sons and who consequently asserted social independence of them and social equality with them14 they were hostile to the aristocratic masters whom they generally denounced as oligarchs slavocrats lords of the lash and terror engenders15 this mercantile and professional class inspired by such men as hinton rowan helper contemplated the removal of the negroes and the bringing of white laborers into the south16 in view of this cleavage it was difficult in the beginning of the struggle to characterize the situation there were unconditional secessionists and unconditional union men judging from the condition then obtaining no one could tell exactly which way the state would go sympathy blood and the community of social feeling growing out of slavery says one inclined her to the south her political faith which clay more than any other man had inspired her with and which crittenden now loyally represented held her fast to the union17 many of the people though believing in states rights did not think that the grievances of the south were such as to justify secession at the same time they opposed coercion and since a reconstructed union was impossible they would have solved the difficulty by peaceful separation writing to gen mcclellan june 8 1861 garrett davis said the sympathy for the south and the inclination to secession among our people is much stronger in the southwestern corner of the state than it is in any other part and as you proceed toward the upper section of the ohio and our virginia line it gradually becomes weaker until it is almost wholly lost i doubt not that two thirds of our people are unconditionally for the union the timid are for it and they shrink from convulsion and civil war while all the bold the reckless and the bankrupt are for secession18 this categorical distinction however is hardly right there were kentuckians of representative families on both sides in all parts of the state except in the extreme west19 a careful study of the facts however leads one to the conclusion that even in the beginning there were more unionists than secessionists the unionists unhappily were not organized while the secessionists were led by the state officials chief among whom was governor magoffin when the southern states began to secede governor magoffin called a special session of the state legislature thinking that he could have a secession convention called he said in part i therefore submit to your consideration the propriety of providing for the election of delegates to a convention to be assembled at an early day to which shall be referred for full and final determination the future of the federal and interstate relations of kentucky he further said kentucky will not be an indifferent observer of the force policy the seceding states have not in their haste and inconsiderate action our approval but their cause is our right and they have our sympathies the people of kentucky will never stand by with folded arms while those states are struggling for their constitutional rights and resisting oppression and being subjugated to an antislavery government20 he believed that the idea of coercion when applied to great political communities is revolting to a free people contrary to the spirit of our institutions and if successful would endanger the liberties of the people21 but the legislature did not provide for such a convention on the eleventh of february this body adjourned it reassembled on the twentieth of march and remained in session until the fourth of april but still these important matters were not decided pursuant to another call of the governor it reassembled on the 6th of may and sat until the twentyfourth of may when it adjourned on the second of september the legislature elected in august came in but still the important question as to what should be done hung in the balance at first there came up the resolutions introduced by george w ewing on the twentyfirst of january expressing regret that certain states had furnished men and money for the coercion of the seceded states and requesting the governor of kentucky to notify such states that should attempts be made to coerce these commonwealths kentucky would join the south22 this resolution passed the house but did not pass the whole legislature as so many have said a resolution for calling a convention to amend the constitution of the united states was passed23 several distinguished men of kentucky sat in this convention which was in session from the fourth to the twentysecond of february without accomplishing anything the majority of kentuckians were then neutral there were two classes of neutrals however this was easily possible since neutrality meant one thing to one man and a different thing to another each faction looked forward to the adoption of this policy as a victory over the other the unionists accepted it as the best policy not knowing that taking such a position they would aid the confederacy even john j crittenden had this idea he said if kentucky and the other border states should assume this attitude war between the two sections of the country would be averted and the confederate states after a few years trial of their experiment would return voluntarily to the union 24 neutrality was considered a necessity for another reason namely the expected short duration of the war no one believed at first that the war would last long even lincoln thought that it would be over in ninety days some therefore felt that kentucky would be foolish to cause blood to be shed on her soil when the war could easily be kept out of the state three months this sentiment however must not be misunderstood as evincing a lack of interest in the union for in the address declaring for neutrality these same leaders said that the dismemberment of the union was no remedy for existing evils but an aggravation of them all25 to many unionists neutrality meant going slowly in the right direction it was in keeping with lincolns plan not to go so rapidly toward coercion in kentucky as he had in the other border states how then did the neutrality policy work out on the twentyninth of january r t jacob introduced in the lower house of the legislature a resolution declaring that the proper position of kentucky was that of a mediator between the sections and that as an umpire she would remain firm and impartial in that day of trial to their beloved country that by counsel and mediation she might aid in restoring peace and harmony and brotherly love giving the reasons for adopting such a policy jacob said this leading sentiment of mediation was indorsed by the union men of both houses of the legislature some may say why did not the kentucky legislature go for coercion for two reasons first some states it is true had seceded from the union but war had not actually commenced second the men at that time who would have undertaken to force coercion upon the legislature would have been in the hopeless minority and would have immediately given a majority to the secessionists it would have ended in total destruction to the cause of the union in the state those resolutions were for two purposes in good faith they were intended to compromise all difference between the states and if possible to restore peace between sections if that failed they were intended to hold if possible our meagre majority until the people could act and we had no doubt that when they did speak it would be in unmistakable tones for the preservation of the union26 no action was taken on these resolutions but on the eleventh of february there was passed a joint measure entitled resolutions declaring action by the legislature on political affairs unnecessary and inexpedient at this time27 these resolutions mentioned the great danger which environed the union asked the confederates to stay the work of secession and protested against coercion the last resolution favored the calling of a convention to amend the constitution of the united states significant too for the unionists were the last words it is unnecessary and inexpedient for the legislature to take any further action on the subject at the present time and as an evidence of the sincerity and good faith of our propositions for an adjustment and our expression of devotion to the union and the desire for its preservation kentucky awaits with great solicitude the responses from her sister states28 neutrality however became the accepted policy of so many that it proved to be dangerous the union state committee in drawing up on the eighteenth of april a resolution to please all seemingly pledged the state to join the south these resolutions were severely criticised by the unionists especially that part which says what the future destiny of kentucky may be we cannot with certainty foresee but if the enterprise announced in the proclamation of the president should at any time hereafter assume the aspect of a war for overrunning and subjugation of the seceding states then kentucky ought to take her stand for the south 29 many thought that this obligated kentucky to go with the south unionists of other states considered it a victory for the confederacy this committee however stipulated this proposition to satisfy those sympathizers with the south who believed all the bad reports concerning the functionaries of the federal government circulated by the leaders of the confederacy hence they said in this proposition not that kentucky would go with the south but if at any time thereafter the presidents proclamation should assume the aspect of war it would do so they evidently did not believe that it had or would assume such an aspect they were also trying to pacify those who misunderstood the issues of subjugation and coercion30 the relation of the states to the union was yet a problem to many a statesman many thought that the colonists when in a state of nature came together and agreed to a compact giving up some of their sovereignty and retaining the other and therefore had the right to withdraw at pleasure carrying a part of the national property with them such thinkers contended too that the union had no right to coerce a seceded state calhoun had said that because the union was a compact it could be broken on the other hand jackson had said that because it was a compact it could not be broken now it was difficult for kentuckians to decide who was right that the committee had no intention of going with the confederacy may be seen from the following declaration seditious leaders in the midst of us now appeal to her kentucky to furnish troops to uphold those combinations against the government of the union will she comply with this appeal ought she to comply with it we answer no31 while these things were going on the great question of fort sumter was before the people when the fort was finally bombarded and lincoln called for seventyfive thousand troops gov magoffin politely refused to comply his reply was i say emphatically kentucky will furnish no troops for the wicked purpose of subduing her sister southern states32 he had already been much moved by the large vote given the delegates to the border states convention indicating such a growth of union sentiment that he called the legislature together hoping to win the day for secession by changing the policy of the state from mediatorial to armed neutrality resisting all forces whether confederate or federal which might bring war into the state the body met on the sixteenth of may passed a resolution of mediatorial neutrality and approved the governors refusal to furnish troops under the existing circumstances33 this however did not mean that the legislature was in sympathy with the efforts of the governor to support the southern cause writing to gen scott john j crittenden explained it thus the position of kentucky and the relation she occupies toward the government of the union is not i fear understood at washington it ought to be well understood very important consequences may depend upon it and upon her proper treatment unfortunately for us our governor does not sympathize with kentucky in respect to secession his opinions and feelings incline him strongly to the side of the south his answer to the requisition for troops was in terms hasty and unbecoming and does not correspond with the usual and gentlemanly courtesy but while she regretted the language of his answer kentucky acquiesced in his declining to furnish the troops called for and she did so not because she loved the union less but she feared that if she had parted with those troops and sent them to serve in your ranks she would have been overwhelmed by secessionists at home and severed from the union and it was to preserve substantially and ultimately our connection with the union that induced us to acquiesce in the partial infraction of it by our governors refusal of the troops required this was the most prevailing and general motive to this may be added the strong indisposition of our people to a civil war with the south and the apprehended consequences of a civil war within our state and among our people i think kentuckys excuse a good one and that under all the circumstances of a complicated case she is rendering better service in her present position than she could by becoming an active party in the contest34 the fact is that secession had little chance in kentucky after public opinion found expression neutrality early became the order of the day the elections of 1861 were significant in that they gave the people a chance to express their will it should be borne in mind that the legislature of 1859 was elected when the question of union or disunion was not before the people now in 1861 they had to elect members to the border state convention a new legislature and congressmen to represent kentucky at the special session called by president lincoln in all these elections unionists won some historians like smith and shaler35 seem to think that the state had pledged itself to remain unconditionally neutral that these elections had no particular bearing on the situation and that if a sovereignty convention had been called secession would have won these writers do not seem to see that the people of kentucky although nominally neutral desired to remain with the union doubtless a better statement is that although the election of 1861 showed that a large majority of the people were in favor of the union the union leaders did not show so in the early part of the year and neutrality was adopted not as an end but as a means that triumph over the enemies of the union might finally be assured36 we easily see now that there was not much danger of secession but the unionists could not see it so well at that time smith and shaler doubtless exaggerate the situation for what danger of secession could there have been when the people had elected the union candidates for the border state convention to be convened at frankfort on may 27 when they sent nine unionists out of the ten congressmen to represent them in the special session of congress and when on the 5th of the following august after the battle of bull run they elected to the state legislature 103 unionists out of 141 members37 the calling of a convention then would have made little difference if the people had chosen a majority of unionists to represent them in other bodies how can one conclude then that they would have elected seceders to represent them in a sovereignty convention hodge states that the sympathizers with the confederacy did not contest to any considerable extent the elections of august 1861 and consequently the supporters of the federal government were in the ascendency in the next legislature he seems to indicate that the unionists used fraud but the records show that the secessionists regarding it as a lost cause in many cases withdrew their candidates evidently these elections showed not only that secession was impossible but that neutrality could not last38 after this sentiment began to change men boldly took decisive positions the unwieldy neutrality party then divided into three parts those who went to the confederate lines to aid the southern cause those who openly declared themselves in favor of the union and those sympathizers with the south who although in favor of the seceding states seeing that their cause was hopeless advocated peaceful separation and finally when that failed a compromise peace between the two sections39 the union party though unalterably opposed to the abolitionists and not primarily attached to the union because of antagonism to slavery gradually acquiesced in the policy of the federal government with respect to that institution this party first reached the position that negroes taken from the confederates could with propriety be disposed of as contraband of war and many of its adherents grew more favorable to the policy of general emancipation it was soon evident that war could not long be kept out of the state as early as april 1861 troops for service in the confederacy were organized in kentucky this movement was somewhat accelerated by an act of the legislature providing that the arms supplied to the troops should not be used against either section and that the state companies as well as the home guards should take the same oath as the officers requiring fidelity to the constitution40 at this point many kentuckians of proslavery tendencies were forced out of their natural position and driven into the confederate ranks among these was s b buckner who went south to command about ten thousand secessionists recruited under the leadership of colonels roger w hanson lloyd tilghman and w d lannon at camp boone41 the governor refused to furnish lincoln troops but he was in touch with the confederacy doing all he could to equip soldiers for its service42 though not exactly openly as that would have been sufficient excuse for the unionists who desired to help the union the unionists who saw all of this going on desired to arm and organize their forces but they were handicapped in that the commander of the state guard was a secessionist and care had been taken to hold the military forces for the south in consequence of this difficulty lincoln was secretly appealed to for arms which were shipped to cities on the ohio river for secret distribution among the unionists of kentucky as the opportunity would permit43 the secessionists had referred to these guns as the first socalled violation of neutrality the unionists defended themselves on the ground that since the governor and his whole machine were about in the ranks of the confederates they were justified in doing almost anything to defend the state shaler says that the action on both sides was almost simultaneous and that the actual infringement of the neutrality proclamation issued by the governor was due to the action of polk and zollicoffer and the simultaneous invasion of the state some hundreds of miles apart shows that the rupture of the neutrality of kentucky was deliberately planned by the confederate authorities44 the invasion by polk in september produced great excitement the legislature was then in session and passed a resolution that the invaders be expelled and that the governor call out the military force of the state and place the same under the command of gen thomas l crittenden the resolutions were vetoed by the governor but passed by a vote of two thirds45 the desired proclamation was issued and soon sufficient men to form forty regiments answered the call46 making further response to the invasion of the state by the confederates the legislature ordered that the united states flag be raised over the capitol at frankfort and by a resolution which affirmed distinctly though not directly the doctrine of states rights placed kentucky in political and military association with the north47 william t mckinney footnotes 1 see debates in congress 2 marshall speech in washington on the nomination of breckenridge and lane

kentucky from secession if what had been unhappily named a sovereignty convention had been called in 1861 if the state had been compelled by the decision of a body of men who were acting under the control of no constitutional enunciation the sense of sympathy and kinship with the southern states such as would easily grow up under popular oratory in a mob would probably have precipitated action

with the year of the conquest of that country by the spaniards in 1524 when there came several negro slaves with the conquistadores from mexico it seems that they soon increased in numbers for among the decrees of the conquistador pedro de alvarado there is one which prohibits the selling of gunpowder to indians and negroes the number of african slaves brought to guatemala had however always remained relatively a very limited one for as the spaniards had plenty of cheap hands by means of a system of indentured labor forced upon the numerous indian population the importation of slaves evidently did not pay them well it seems safe to say that their total number never amounted to ten thousand the most copious though still very sparse notices of them i have run across are those given by thomas gage an english catholic educated in spain who in the twenties and thirties of the seventeenth century lived as a priest in the then city of guatemala nowadays called antigua and in some indian villages not far from there1 one of the places where thomas gage observed a somewhat considerable population of negroes was the socalled costa del sur or southern coast the hot land between the andes and the pacific to the south of the capital they were worked there on the indigo plantations and large cattle haciendas the negroes impressed thomas gage as the only courageous people in guatemala while the spanish mestizos and indians seemed to him to be very cowardly this writer said that if guatemala was powerful with respect to its people for she was not in arms nor resources then she was so merely by virtue of a class of desperate negroes who were slaves living on the indigo plantations though they had no arms but a machete which was their small lance used for chasing the wild cattle nowadays that name is given to a long and broad swordlike knife they were so desperate that they often caused fear to the very city of guatemala and had made their masters tremble there are among them said he those who have no fear to brave a wild bull furious though he be and to attach themselves to the crocodiles in the rivers until they have killed them and brought them to the bank2 in reading these lines one cannot help from remembering the classical description alexander von humboldt gives of the negro boatmen of the river dagua in the actual republic of colombia the inimitable skill and unsurpassable bravery humboldt saw them display in the midst of the ferocious currents and loudpouring rapids of that river caused him to exclaim every movement of the paddle is a wonder and every negro a god a nice monument to the fame of indomitable bravery the negroes manifested in past times in guatemala exists still in a saying often heard by travelers esos son negros or those are negroes an exclamation which means those are desperate men who do not care for anything one could also hear the saying esto es obra de negros or that is a work of negroes the meaning being that it was work for bold men with iron nerves another expression brings out the fact that the negroes were considered or forced to be very hard workers trabaja como un negro or he works like a negro signified doing the most arduous labor that the lot of the slaves was often a bitter one though because of the less greedy spanish character without doubt generally a less hard one than in north america is shown by the fact that guatemala had her cimarrones just as jamaica and guiana had their maroons the spanish word cimarron signifies indiscriminately a runaway head of cattle or horses that had become wild or a runaway slave the fugitive negroes of guatemala had their chief stronghold in the inaccessible mountain woods of the sierra de las minas which lies near the atlantic coast between the golfo dulce and the valley of the river motagua the golfo dulce which is now abandoned because of lack of sufficient depth for the big vessels of today was at that time the port of entry for the whole of guatemala from it a bridlepath ran over the sierra de las minas to the valley of the motagua and further on to the capital in speaking of this path over the mountain gage remarks what the spaniards fear most until they get out of these mountains are two or three hundred negroes cimarrones who for the bad treatment they received have fled from guatemala and from other places running away from their masters in order to resort to these woods there they live with their wives and children and increase in numbers every year so that the entire force of guatemala city and its environments is not capable to subdue them they very often came out of the woods to attack those who drove teams of mules and took from them wine salt clothes and arms to the quantity they needed they never did any harm to the mule drivers nor to their slaves on the contrary the slaves amused themselves with the cimarrones because they were of the same color and in the same condition of servitude and not seldom availed themselves of the opportunity to follow their example and united with them to obtain liberty though obliged to live in the woods and mountains their arms were arrows and bows which they carried only for the purpose of defending themselves against attacks of the spaniards for they did not harm those who passed by peacefully and who let them have a part of the provisions they carried they often declared that their principal reason for resorting to these mountains was to be ready to join the english or dutch if these some day appeared in the gulf for they well knew that these unlike the spaniards would let them live in peace among the most remarkable facts learned by thomas gage in guatemala is the story of a negro freedman who had accumulated great wealth this negro lived in agua caliente an indian village on the road to guatemala city or antigua where the natives had obtained considerable quantities of gold from some spot in the mountains only known to them the spaniards not content with an annual tribute paid them by the indians endeavored in vain to force the natives to show them the mine and because they refused killed them thus gaining no knowledge of the mine for which they were still searching in vain in the times of thomas gage in that place of agua caliente continues gage there is a negro who lives and receives very well the travelers who call upon him his wealth consists in cattle sheep and goats and he furnishes the city of guatemala and the environments with the best cheese to be found in the country but it is believed that his wealth does not come so much from the produce of his farm and his cattle and cheese but from that hidden treasure which is believed known to him he therefore has been summoned to the royal audience in guatemala but he has always denied to have any knowledge of it he had been suspected because he had formerly been a slave and had secured his liberty by means of a considerable sum after that he had bought his farm and much of the surrounding land and had considerably increased his original holdings to his inquisitors he replied that when young and still a slave he had a kind master who suffered him to do what he pleased and that by economy he had accumulated wherewith to buy his liberty and afterwards a little house to live in and god had given his blessing to that and let him have the means for increasing his funds another one of gages accounts discloses the abuses common among the slaveholders under spanish rule and the silliness of the belief that the masters for their own benefit would treat their human property well this account refers to one juan palomeque a rich landowner and promoter of muletransports who lived in gages parish of mexico near the actual capital of guatemala he was believed to be worth six hundred thousand ducats about 1400000 dollars he owned about a hundred negroes men women and children but was so stingy that to avoid the expense of decent housekeeping he never lived in the city though he had several houses there instead he lived in a strawhut and feasted on hard black bread and on tasajo or thin strips of salt beef dried in the sun he was so cruel to his negroes that when one of them behaved badly he would whip him almost to death he had among others a slave named macaco on behalf of whom said gage i often pleaded but in vain at times he hung him by the hands and beat him until he had his back entirely covered with blood and in that state the skin being entirely torn to pieces in order to heal up the slaves sores the master poured hot fat over them moreover he had marked him with a hot iron face hands arms back belly and legs so that this poor slave got tired to live and intended several times to suicide himself but i prevented him from doing so every time by remonstrances i made him juan palomeque was so sensual and voluptuous that he constantly abused the wives of his slaves as he liked and even when he saw in the city some girl or woman of that class whom he wanted and she was not attracted to him he would call upon her master or mistress and buy her giving much more than she had cost afterwards he boasted that he would break down her pride in one year of slavery in my times said gage he killed two indians on the road to the gulf but by means of his money he got so easily out of that affair as if he had killed but a dog as gage does not tell anything of a prosecution for the crimes against the negro no actual law seems to have been violated3 the descendants of the ancient slaves have so completely become mixed up with spanishindian blood that making exception of the valley of the motagua river they have practically disappeared as a race in 1796 their number was considerably increased by the socalled caribs whom the english deported from the island of st vincent and set ashore in guatemala they live now on the atlantic coast also on that of honduras and nicaragua and are estimated to total about 20000 they are zambos but the african blood seems to prevail4 a mulatto corsair of the sixteenth century when on his return voyage to england sailing down the atlantic coast of costa rica thomas gages ship was intercepted by two corsairs under the dutch flag one of them being a manofwar the struggle of the netherlands for freedom against spain had not then come to a close the dutch commander was a character of whose strange experiences gage gives an interesting account much to the surprise of the traveler the captain who had caught them was a mulatto named diaguillo who was born and brought up at habana cuba where his mother was still living having been maltreated by the governor of campeche in whose service he had been this mulatto in a fit of utter desperation threw himself into a boat and ventured into the sea where he met with some dutch ships on watch for a prize he swam to and went aboard one of these vessels hoping to find better treatment than among his countrymen he offered himself to the dutch and promised to serve them loyally against those of his nation who had maltreated him afterwards he proved himself so loyal and reliable to the dutch that he won much fame among them he was married to a girl of their nation and later made captain of a vessel under that brave and noble dutchman whom the spaniards dreaded much and whom they named pie de palo or woodenleg that famous mulatto said gage was he who boarded our frigate with his soldiers i lost four thousand pesos wealth in pearls and jewelry and about three thousand in ready money i had still other things with me viz a bed some books pictures painted on copper and clothes and i asked that mulatto captain to let me keep them he donated me them liberally out of consideration for my vocation and said i must take patience for he was not allowed to dispose in other way of my pearls and my money moreover he used the proverb if fortune today is on my side tomorrow it will be on yours and what i have won today that i may lose tomorrow he also ordered to give me back some single and double pistoles out of generosity and respect to my garb after having searched their prize continued the traveler captain and soldiers thought of refreshing themselves on the provisions we had on board the generous captain had a luxurious dinner and invited me to be his guest and knowing that i was going to habana he drank the health of his mother and asked me to go to see her and give her his kindest regards saying that for her sake he had treated me as kindly as was in his power he told us moreover when still at table that for my sake he would give us back our ship so that we could get back to land and that i might find some other and safer way to continue my voyage to spain everything taken away from the ship save my belongings which captain diaguillo ordered to let me out of a generosity not often to be found with a corsair he bade us farewell thanking us for the good luck we had procured him thomas gage reached habana in safety and called upon the mother of the corsair but does not say how he found her j kunst footnotes 1 gage published in 1648 in london an account of his residence and voyages i have only a french version of his work at hand printed in amsterdam in 1721 the passages cited are retranslated from that language and therefore will not agree word for word with the original text 2 gages voyages part 3 chapter ii 3 it seems proper to add here that three years after guatemala had declared her independence of spain she abrogated slavery by decree of april 17 1824 thereby she got by the way into difficulties with great britain which as late as in 1840 demanded the extradition of slaves run away from the adjacent british territory of balize guatemala was by menofwar sent to her coast forced to do so though that was contrary to her constitution 4 within the last decades some negroes have been brought over from the united states to the banana plantations of united fruit co near the atlantic coast and occasionally though very seldom one meets with a black newcomer from jamaica barbadoes or other west indian islands documents travelers impressions of slavery in america from 1750 to 1800 from these writers almost all of whom were foreigners one would naturally expect such a portraiture of slavery as persons unaccustomed to the institution would give most americans of course considered the institution as belonging to the natural order of things and therefore hardly ever referred to it except when they mentioned it unconsciously foreigners however as soon as they came into this new world began to compare the slaves with the lowest order of society in europe finding the lot of the bondmen so much inferior to that of those of low estate in european countries these travelers frequently made some interesting comparisons we are indebted to them for valuable information which we can never hope to obtain from the literature of an essentially slaveholding people here we see how the american revolution caused a change for the better in the condition of the negroes in certain states and how the rigorousness of slavery continued in the others we learn too what enlightened negroes thought about their state and what the white man believed should be done to prevent their reaching the point of selfassertion that a large number of antislavery americans were advocating and effecting the emancipation of slaves appears throughout these documents burnabys view of the situation in virginia speaking of virginia he said their authority over their slaves renders them vain and imperious and entire strangers to that elegance of sentiment which is so peculiarly characteristic of refined and polished nations their ignorance of mankind and of learning exposes them to many errors and prejudices especially in regard to indians and negroes whom they scarcely consider as of human species so that it is almost impossible in cases of violence or even murder committed upon those unhappy people by any of the planters to have delinquents brought to justice for either the grand jury refuse to find the bill or the petit jury bring in the verdict of not guiltyandrew burnaby travels 1759 p 54 general treatment of slaves among the albaniansconsequent attachment of domesticsreflections on servitude by an american lady in the society i am describing even the dark aspect of slavery was softened into a smile and i must in justice to the best possible masters say that a great deal of that tranquility and comfort to call it by no higher name which distinguished this society from all others was owing to the relation between master and servant being better understood here than in any other place let me not be detested as an advocate for slavery when i say that i think i have never seen people so happy in servitude as the domestics of the albanians one reason was for i do not now speak of the virtues of their masters that each family had a few of them and that there were no field negroes they would remind one of abrahams servants who were all born in the house which was exactly their case they were baptized too and shared the same religious instruction with the children of the family and for the first years there was little or no difference with regard to food or clothing between their children and those of their masters when a negrowomans child attained the age of three years the first new years day after it was solemnly presented to a son or daughter or other young relative of the family who was of the same sex with the child so presented the child to whom the young negro was given immediately presented it with some piece of money and a pair of shoes and from that day the strongest attachment subsisted between the domestic and the destined owner i have no where met with instances of friendship more tender and generous than that which here subsisted between the slaves and their masters and mistresses extraordinary proofs of them have been often given in the course of hunting or indian trading when a young man and his slave have gone to the trackless woods together in the case of fits of the ague loss of a canoe and other casualties happening near hostile indians the slave has been known at the imminent risque of his life to carry his disabled master through trackless woods with labour and fidelity scarce credible and the master has been equally tender on similar occasions of the humble friend who stuck closer than a brother who was baptized with the same baptism nurtured under the same roof and often rocked in the same cradle with himself these gifts of domestics to the younger members of the family were not irrevokable yet they were very rarely withdrawn if the kitchen family did not increase in proportion to that of the master young children were purchased from some family where they abounded to furnish those attached servants to the rising progeny they were never sold without consulting their mothers who if expert and sagacious had a great deal to say in the family and would not allow her child to go into any family with whose domestics she was not acquainted these negrowomen piqued themselves on teaching their children to be excellent servants well knowing servitude to be their lot or life and that it could only be sweetened by making themselves particularly useful and excellent in their departments if they did their work well it is astonishing when i recollect it what liberty of speech was allowed to those active and prudent mothers they would chide reprove and expostulate in a manner that we would not endure from our hired servants and sometimes exert fully as much authority over the children of the family as the parents conscious that they were entirely in their power they did not crush freedom of speech and opinion in those by whom they knew they were beloved and who watched with incessant care over their interest and comfort affectionate and faithful as these homebred servants were in general there were some instances but very few of those who through levity of mind or a love of liquor or finery betrayed their trust or habitually neglected their duty in these cases after every means had been used to reform them no severe punishments were inflicted at home but the terrible sentence which they dreaded worse than death was pastthey were sold to jamaica the necessity of doing this was bewailed by the whole family as a most dreadful calamity and the culprit was carefully watched on his way to newyork lest he should evade the sentence by selfdestruction one must have lived among those placid and humane people to be sensible that servitude hopeless endless servitude could exist with so little servility and fear on the one side and so little harshness or even sternness of authority on the other in europe the footing on which service is placed in consequence of the corruptions of society hardens the heart destroys confidence and embitters life the deceit and venality of servants not absolutely dishonest puts it out of ones power to love or trust them and if in hopes of having people attached to us who will neither betray our confidence nor corrupt our children we are at pains to rear them from childhood and give them a religious and moral education after all our labour others of their own class seduce them away to those who can afford to pay higher for their services this is not the case in a few remote districts where surrounding mountains seem to exclude the contagion of the world some traces of fidelity and affection among domestics still remain but it must be remarked that in those very districts it is usual to treat inferiors with courtesy and kindness and to consider those domestics who marry out of the family as holding a kind of relation to it and still claiming protection in short the corruption of that class of people is doubtless to be attributed to the example of their superiors but how severely are those superiors punished why this general indifference about home why are the household gods why is the sacred hearth so wantonly abandoned alas the charm of home is destroyed since our children educated in distant seminaries are strangers in the paternal mansion and our servants like mere machines move on their mercenary track without feeling or exciting one kind or generous sentiment home thus despoiled of all its charms is no longer the scene of any enjoyments but such as wealth can purchase at the same time we feel there a nameless cold privation and conscious that money can coin the same enjoyments with more variety elsewhere we substitute these futile and evanescent pleasures for that perennial spring of calm satisfaction without oerflowing full which is fed by the exercise of the kindly affections and soon indeed must those stagnate where there are not proper objects to excite them i have been forced into this painful digression by unavoidable comparisons to return amidst all this mild and really tender indulgence to their negroes these colonists had not the smallest scruple of conscience with regard to the right by which they held them in subjection had that been the case their singular humanity would have been incompatible with continued injustice but the truth is that of law the generality of those people knew little and of philosophy nothing at all they sought their code of morality in the bible and there imagined they found this hapless race condemned to perpetual slavery and thought nothing remained for them but to lighten the chains of their fellow christians after having made them such this i neither extenuate nor set down in malice but merely record the fact at the same time it is but justice to record also a singular instance of moral delicacy distinguishing this settlement from every other in the like circumstances though from their simple and kindly modes of life they were from infancy in habits of familiarity with these humble friends yet being early taught that nature had placed between them a barrier which it was in a high degree criminal and disgraceful to pass they considered a mixture of such distinct races with abhorrence as a violation of her laws this greatly conduced to the preservation of family happiness and concord an ambiguous race which the law does not acknowledge and who if they have any moral sense must be as much ashamed of their parents as these last are of them are certainly a dangerous because degraded part of the community how much more so must be those unfortunate beings who stand in the predicament of the bat in the fable whom both birds and beasts disowned i am sorry to say that the progress of the british army when it arrived might be traced by a spurious and ambiguous race of this kind but of a mulatto born before their arrival i only remember a single instance and from the regret and wonder it occasioned considered it as singular colonel schuyler of whom i am to speak had a relation so weak and defective in capacity that he never was intrusted with any thing of his own and lived an idle bachelor about the family in process of time a favourite negrowoman to the great offense and scandal of the family bore a child to him whose colour gave testimony to the relation the boy was carefully educated and when he grew up a farm was allotted to him well stocked and fertile but in depth of woods embraced about two miles back from the family seat a destitute white woman who had somehow wandered from the older colonies was induced to marry him and all the branches of the family thought it incumbent on them now and then to pay a quiet visit to chalk for so for some unknown reason they always called him i have been in chalks house myself and a most comfortable abode it was but considered him as a mysterious and anomalous being i have dwelt the longer on this singular instance of slavery existing devoid of its attendant horrors because the fidelity and affection resulting from a bond of union so early formed between master and servant contributed so very much to the safety of individuals as well as the general comfort of society as will hereafter appearmemoirs of an american lady with sketches of manners and customs in america as they existed previous to the revolution chapter vii pp 2632 by mrs anne grant impressions of an english traveler as i observed before at least two thirds of the inhabitants are negroes it is fortunate for humanity that these poor creatures possess such a fund of contentment and resignation in their minds for they

tour in the united states of america containing an account of the present situation of that country london 1784 p 39 abb robin on conditions in virginia the population of virginia is computed at one hundred fifty thousand whites and five hundred thousand negroes there is a still greater disproportion between the whites and blacks in maryland where there are not more than twenty thousand whites and at least two hundred thousand negroes the english imported into these two provinces between seven and eight thousand yearly perhaps the lot of these slaves is not quite so hard as that of the negroes in the islands their liberty it is true is irreparably lost in both places but here they are treated with more mildness and are supported upon the same kind of food with their masters and if the earth which they cultivate is moistened with their sweat it has never been known to blush with their blood the american not at all industrious by nature is considerate enough not to expect too much from his slave who in such circumstances has fewer motives to be laborious for himselfabb robin new travels through north america in a series of letters boston 1784 p 48 observations of st john de crvecoeur there arranged like horses at a fair they are branded like cattle and then driven to toil to starve and to languish for a few years on the different plantations of those citizens if negroes are permitted to become fathers this fatal indulgence only tends to increase their misery how many have i seen cursing the irresistible propensity and regretting that by having tasted of those joys they had become the authors of double misery to their wives their paternal fondness is embittered by considering that if their children live they must live to be slaves like themselves no time is allowed them to exercise their pious offices the mothers must fasten them on their backs and with the double load follow their husbands in the fields where they too often hear no other sound than that of the voice or whip of the taskmaster and the cries of their infants broiling in the sun it is said i know that they are much happier here than in the west indies because land being cheaper upon this continent than in those islands the field allowed them to raise their subsistence from are in general more extensive we have slaves likewise in our northern provinces i hope the time draws near when they will be all emancipated but how different their lot how different their situation in every possible respect they enjoy as much liberty as their masters they are as well clad and as well fed in health and sickness they are tenderly taken care of they live under the same roof and are truly speaking a part of our families many of them are taught to read and write and are well instructed in the principles of religion they are the companions of our labours and treated as such they enjoy many perquisites many established holidays and are not obliged to work more than white people they marry when their inclination leads them visit their wives every week are as decently clad as the common people they are indulged in education cherishing and chastising their children who are taught subordination to them as to their lawful parents in short they participate in many of the benefits of our society without being obliged to bear any of its burdens they are fat healthy and hearty and far from repining at their fate they think themselves happier than many of the lower class whites they share with their master the wheat and meat provision they help to raise many of those whom the good quakers have emancipated have received that great benefit with tears of regret and have never quitted though free their former masters and benefactorsst john de crvecoeur letters from an american farmer 1782 pp 226 et seq impressions of johann d schoepf the condition of the carolina negro slaves is in general harder and more troublous than that of their northern brethren on the rice plantations with wretched food they are allotted more work and more tedious work and the treatment which they experience at the hands of the overseers and owners is capricious and often tyrannical in carolina and in no other of the north american states their severe handling has already caused several uprisings among them there is less concern here as to their moral betterment education and instruction and south carolina appears little inclined to initiate the praiseworthy and benevolent ordinances of its sister states in regard to the negro it is sufficient proof of the bad situation in which these creatures find themselves here that they do not multiply in the same proportions as the white inhabitants although the climate is more natural to them and agrees with them better their numbers must be continually kept up by fresh importations to be sure the constant taking up of new land requires more and more working hands and the pretended necessity of bringing in additional slaves is thus warranted in part but close investigation makes it certain that the increase of the blacks in the northern states where they are handled more gently is vastly more considerable the gentlemen in the country have among their negroes as the russian nobility among the serfs the most necessary handicraftsmen cobblers tailors carpenters smiths and the like whose work they command at the smallest possible price or for nothing almost there is hardly any trade or craft which has not been learned and is not carried on by negroes partly free partly slave the latter are hired out by their owners for days wages charleston swarms with blacks mulattoes and mestizos their number greatly exceeds that of the whites but they are kept under strict order and discipline and the police has a watchful eye upon them these may nowhere assemble more than 7 male negro slaves their dances and other assemblies must stop at 10 oclock in the evening without permission of their owners none of them may sell beer or wine or brandy there are here many free negroes and mulattoes they get their freedom if by their own industry they earn enough to buy themselves off or their freedom is given them at the death of their masters or in other ways not all of them know how to use their freedom to their own advantage many give themselves up to idleness and dissipation which bring them finally to crafty deceptions and thievery they are besides extraordinarily given to vanity and love to adorn themselves as much as they can and to conduct themselves importantly johann d schoepf travels in the confederation 1784 p 220 extracts from anbureys travels through north america thus the whole management of the plantation is left to the overseer who as an encouragement to make the most of the crops has a certain portion as his wages but not having any interest in the negroes any further than their labour he drives and whips them about and works them beyond their strength and sometimes till they expire he feels no loss in their death he knows the plantation must be supplied and his humanity is estimated by his interest which rises always above freezing point it is the poor negroes who alone work hard and i am sorry to say fare hard incredible is the fatigue which the poor wretches undergo and that nature should be able to support it there certainly must be something in their constitutions as well as their color different from us that enables them to endure it they are called up at day break and seldom allowed to swallow a mouthful of homminy or hoe cake but are drawn out into the field immediately where they continue at hard labour without intermission till noon when they go to their dinners and are seldom allowed an hour for that purpose their meals consist of hominy and salt and if their master is a man of humanity touched by the finer feelings of love and sensibility he allows them twice a week a little skimmed milk fat rusty bacon or salt herring to relish this miserable and scanty fare the man at this plantation in lieu of these grants his negroes an acre of ground and all saturday afternoon to raise grain and poultry for themselves after they have dined they return to labor in the field until dusk in the evening here one naturally imagines the daily labor of these poor creatures was over not so they repair to the tobacco houses where each has a task of stripping allotted which takes them up some hours or else they have such a quantity of indian corn to husk and if they neglect it are tied up in the morning and receive a number of lashes from those unfeeling monsters the overseers whose masters suffer them to exercise their brutal authority without constraint thus by their night task it is late in the evening before these poor creatures return to their second scanty meal and the time taken up at it encroaches upon their hours of sleep which for refreshment of food and sleep together can never be reckoned to exceed eight when they lay themselves down to rest their comforts are equally miserable and limited for they sleep on a bench or on the ground with an old scanty blanket which serves them at once for bed and covering their cloathing is not less wretched consisting of a shirt and trowsers of coarse thin hard hempen stuff in the summer with an addition of a very coarse woolen jacket breeches and shoes in winter but since the war their masters for they cannot get the cloathing as usual suffer them to go in rags and many in a state of nudity the female slaves share labor and repose just in the same manner except a few who are termd house negroes and are employed in household drugery these poor creatures are all submission to injuries and insults and are obliged to be passive nor dare they resist or defend themselves if attacked without the smallest provocation by a white person as the law directs the negroes arm to be cut off who raises it against a white person should it be only in defence against wanton barbarity and outrage notwithstanding this humiliating state and rigid treatment to which this wretched race are subject they are devoid of care and appear jovial contented and happy it is a fortunate circumstance that they possess and are blessed with such an easy satisfied disposition otherwise they must inevitably sink under such a complication of misery and wretchedness what is singularly remarkable they always carry out a piece of fire and kindle one near their work let the weather be so hot and sultry as i have several times mentioned homminy and hoecake it may not be amiss to explain them the former is made of indian corn which is coarsely broke and boiled with a few french beans till it is almost a pulp hoecake is indian corn ground into meal kneaded into a dough and baked before a fire but as the negroes bake theirs on the hoes that they work with they have the appellation of hoecakes these are in common use among the inhabitants i cannot say they are palateable for as to flavor one made of sawdust would be equally good and not unlike it in appearance but they are certainly a very strong and hearty food anburey travels through america during the war vol 2 pp 3305 vindication of the negroes a controversy first let me repeat your longest section relative to that people below this class of inhabitants the whites of no property in virginia we must rank the negroes who would be still more to be pitied if their natural insensibility did not in some measure alleviate the wretchedness inseparable from slavery seeing them ill lodged ill clothed and often overcome with labour i concluded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is elsewhere notwithstanding i have been assured that it is very mild compared to what they suffer in the sugar colonies and indeed one does not hear habitually as at jamaica and st domingo the sound of whips and the outcries of the wretched beings whose bodies are torn piece meal by their strokes it is because the people of virginia are commonly milder than those of the sugar colonies which consist chiefly of rapacious men eager to amass fortunes as soon as possible and return to europe the produce of their labours being also less valuable their tasks are not so rigorously exacted and in justice to both it must be allowed that the negroes themselves are less treacherous and thievish than they are in the islands for the propagation of the black species being very considerable here most of them are born in the country and it is remarked that these are in general less depraved than those imported from africa besides we must do the virginians the justice to remark that many of them treat their negroes with a great deal of humanity and what is still more to their honor they appear sorry there are any among them and are forever talking of abolishing slavery and falling upon some other mode of improving their land c however this may be it is fortunate that different motives concur to deter mankind from exercising such tyranny at least upon their own species if we cannot say strictly speaking their equals for the more we observe the negroes the more we are convinced that the difference between us does not lie in the colour alone c enough upon this subject which has not escaped the attention of the politicians and philosophers of the present age i have only to apologize for treating it without declamation but i have always thought that eloquence can only influence the resolutions of the moment and that every thing which requires time must be the work of reason and besides it will be an easy matter to add ten or twelve pages to these few reflections which may be considered as a concert composed only of principal parts con corni ad libertum upon reading this passage attentively i was surprised to find it contain a singular mixture of contradictory principles and in the same breath the sentiments of a philosopher and of a colonist of an advocate for the negroes and of their enemy it is evident that as a philosopher and a friend to humanity you are inclined to alleviate the lot of the negroes and commend those who do so but this tenderness itself conceals a subtile venom that ought to be exposed for you only bestow your pity upon the negroes while you owe them if you are a philosopher vindication and defense you wish their masters to be humane they ought to be just instead of praising such humanity you ought to have blamed them for stopping there in short such a contempt for the negroes pervades this whole article as will necessarily encourage their tormentors to rivet their chains is not this contempt observable for instance in the very first period below this class of inhabitants the meanest whites of virginia we must rank the negroes who would be still more to be pitied if their natural insensibility did not in some measure alleviate the wretchedness inseparable from slavery and who told you sir that nature had created the negroes with less feeling than other men do you judge so because they have vegetated for three centuries in european fetters and at this day have not altogether shaken off the horrid yoke but do not their frequent risings and the cruelties they from time to time retaliate upon their masters give the lie to this natural insensibility for an insensible being has no resentment if he does not feel how should he remember do you think the wretched indians who since the discovery of the new world are burried in the mines of peru are also naturally insensible because they suffer patiently you calumniate nature in making her grant favours to particulars in giving her a system of inequality among her offspring all men are cast in the same mouldthe varieties which distinguish individuals are the sports of chance or the result of different circumstances but the black comes into the world with as much sensibility as the white the peruvian as the european what then degrades this natural and moral sensibility the greater or less privation of liberty in proportion as man loses it he loses the powers of sensation he loses the man he sickens or becomes a brute it is slavery alone which can reduce a man to a level with the brute creation and sometimes deprives him of all sensibility but you blame nature that kind parent who would have us all equal free and happy for the crime of social barbarity and you pass by this crime to extenuate another to extenuate the horrid torments of slavery not satisfied with violating nature by abusing her offspring even in her name you encourage slaveholders to torment them do you not arm their tyrants when you tell them the insensibility of the negroes alleviates their torments what because greatness of soul raised sidney above the terrors of death the infernal jefferies1 who caused his execution was less guilty because the quakers appeared insensible to insults blows or punishments they are less to be pitied and it was right to martyr them a dangerous notion whose consequences i am sure you would disapprove if this insensibility with which you reproach the negroes mitigated the cruelty of their masters it were well but their tormentors do not wish them not to feel they would have them all feeling for the pleasure of torturing them and their punishments are increased in proportion to their insensibility seeing the negroes say you ill lodged ill cloathed and often overcome with labour i concluded that their treatment had been as rigorous as it is elsewhere notwithstanding i have been assured that it is very mild compared to what they suffer in the sugar colonies why this comparison which seems to insinuate a justification of the virginians does a misfortune cease to be such because there is a greater elsewhere was cartouche less detestable because brinvilliers had existed before him let us not weaken by comparisons the idea of criminality nor lessen the attention due to the miserable this were to countenance the crime the negroes are ill lodged ill cloathed oppressed with labour in virginia this is the fact this is the offence it matters not whether they are worse treated elsewhere in whatever degree they are so in virginia it is still outrage and injustice and again why are the negroes of virginia less cruelly treated humanity is not the motive it is because covetousness cannot obtain so much from their labours as in the sugar islands was it otherwise they would be sacrificed to it here as well as there how can we praise such forced humanity how on the contrary not give vent to all the indignation which must naturally arise in every feeling mind and to do justice to both you add if the virginians are not so severe it is because the negroes themselves are less treacherous and thievish than in the islands because the propagation of the black species being very considerable here most of the negroes are born in the country and it is remarked that these are in general less depraved than those imported from africa here is a strange confusion of causes and effects and a strange abuse of words first let us clear up the facts here are some valuable ones for the cause of the negroes you say they are not so thievish in virginia propagate faster and are less depraved why because they are less cruelly treatedhere is the cause and the effect you have mistaken one for the other we must conclude from this fact that if the virginians were no longer severe and should treat the blacks like fellowcreatures they would not be more vicious than their white servants the degree of oppression is the measure of what is improperly called the viciousness of the slavesthe more cruel their tyrants the more treacherous villainous and cruel are the slaves in returncan we wonder that macronius should assassinate his master tiberius this viciousness is a punishment that heaven inflicts upon tyranny can the efforts of a slave for the recovery of his liberty be denominated vicious or criminal from the moment you violate the laws of nature in regard to them why should not they shake them off in their relative duties to you you rob them of liberty and you would not have them steal your gold you whip and cruelly torment them and expect them not to struggle for deliverance you assassinate them every day and expect them not to assassinate you once you call your outrages rights and the courage which repulses them a crime what a confusion of ideas what horrid logic and you sir a humane philosopher are accessory to this injustice by describing the blacks in the style of a dealer in human flesh you call what are no more than natural consequences of the compression of the spring of libertytreachery theft and depravation2 but can a natural consequence be criminal remove the cause or is it not the only crime for my part sir i firmly believe that the barbarities committed by the negroes not merely against their masters but even against others will be attributed at the bar of eternal justice to the slaveholders and those infamous persons employed in the guinea trade i firmly believe that no human justice has the right of putting a negro slave to death for any crime whatever because not being free he is not sui juris and should be regarded as a child or an idiot being almost always under the lash i believe that the real criminal the cause of the crime is the man who first seized him sold him or enslaved himand if ever i should fall under the knife of an unhappy runaway i would not resent it upon him but upon those white men who keep blacks in slavery i would tell them your cruelty towards your negroes has endangered my lifethey execrate you they take me for a tyrant because i am white like you and the vengeance due to your crimes has fallen upon me god forbid however that i should undertake to encourage the blacks to take up arms against their masters god forbid however that i should undertake to justify the excesses to which their resentments have sometimes hurried them and which have often fallen on persons who were not accessary to their wretchedness the slavery under which they groan must be abolished by peaceable means and thanks to the active spirit of benevolence which animates the quakers the pious undertaking is already begun in most of the united states of america the yoke has been taken from their necks in others the guineatrade has been prohibited societies have been formed both at paris and london to collect and circulate information upon this interesting subject to induce the european governments to put a stop to the negro trade and provide for their gradual emancipation in the westindia islands no doubt success will crown their views and the friends of liberty will enjoy the satisfaction of communicating its blessings to the blacks but the blacks must wait for the happy moment that shall restore them to civil life in silence and in peace they must rely upon the unwearied diligence and zeal of the numerous writers who advocate their cause and the efforts of the humane to second their endeavors they must strive to justify and support the arguments that are adduced in their favour by displaying virtue in the very bosom of slavery they must endeavour in a word to render themselves worthy of liberty that they may know how to use it when it shall be restored to them for liberty itself is sometimes a burden when slavery has stupefied the soul such blacks therefore as are so inconsiderate as to be concerned in insurrections are guilty of retarding the execution of the general plan for their emancipation for the question is not at the present day whether a million of slaves ought to be set at liberty but whether they can when free be put into a capacity of providing for the subsistence of themselves and their families insurrections far from effecting this purpose would destroy the means regard therefore to their own interests if there were no other motive should therefore engage the blacks to patient submission and no doubt but they will yield it if their masters and the ministers of the gospel in particular to whom the task of comforting and instructing them is committed endeavour to prepare them for approaching freedom you sir have adopted the vulgar notion that the negroes born in virginia are less depraved than those imported from africa you call the firmness which is common in the early stages of their slavery greater degeneracy they are depraved that is in your languagethey are wicked and treacherous to those who have purchased them or brought them from their own countrybut in my mind they are not depraved because the acts of violence their genius inspires them to revenge themselves upon their tyrants are justified by the rights of nature and why are those imported more wicked in your opinion in mine more quick more ardent in their resentments because not having forgotten their former situation they feel their loss the more sensibly and having strong ideas their resolutions are more firm and their actions more violent they not having yet contracted the habits of slavery they soon fall into that degree of apathy and insensibility which you unjustly believe to be natural to them that is in your language they become less depraved but i would say that their depravity begins with this apathy and weaknessfor depravity is the loss of nature and the want of those virtues inherent in man courage and the love of liberty our readers may judge from this article how strangely writers have wrested words to condemn these unhappy negroes and the unfortunate in general i do not however pretend to say that the negroes of africa are all good or even that many of them are not depraved but is this fact to be imputed to them as a personal crime ought you not rather to have ascribed it to the foreign source by which they are corrupted alike in them and in the whites the depravity of man is a consequence of his wretchedness and the usurpation of his rights wherever he is free and at ease he is good wherever the contrary he is wicked neither his nature nor the climate corrupt him but the government of his country now that of the negroes is almost universally despotic such as must necessarily debase and corrupt the negro how much is the depravity occasioned by the government of his country increased by his second slavery far worse than the firstfor he is no longer among friends in his native landsurrounded by the pleasing scenes of his childhood he is among monsters who are going to live by and trade in his blood and has nothing before his eyes but death or oppression equivalent to an endless punishment how is it possible such horrid prospects should not fire his soul how if chance should present him with arms and liberty should he resist using them to put an end to his own existence or that of his tormentors what white man would be less cruel in his situation truly i think myself of a humane disposition that i love my fellowcreatures and detest the effusion of blood but if ever a villain white or black should snatch me from my freedom my family and my friends should overwhelm me with outrages and blows to gratify his caprice should extend his barbarities to my wife and childrenmy blood boils at the thoughtperhaps in a transport of revenge if such vengeance would be lawful in me what makes the negro more guilty why should that be called wickedness and depravity in him which would be stiled virtue in me in you in every white man are not my rights the same as his is not nature our common parent god his father as well as mine his conscience an infallible guide as well as mine let us then no longer make other laws for the blacks than those we are bound by ourselves since heaven has placed them on a level with us has made them like us since they are our brethren and our fellowcreatures here you stop me you say that the negro is not our fellowcreature that he is below the white how could so shocking an opinion escape the pen of a member of the royal academy a writer who would be thought a friend of mankind do not you see the tormentors of st domingo avail themselves of it already redoubling their strokes and regarding their slaves as mere machines like the cartesians do the brutes they are not our fellowcreatures will they say a philosopher of paris has proved it what the blacks our equals have not they eyes ears a shape and organs like ours does nature follow another order other laws for themhave not they speech that peculiar characteristic of humanity but then the colour what of that are the pale white albinos the olive or copper coloured indians also of different species who does not know that colour is accidental they are not our equals have not they the same facultiesreason memory imagination yes you reply but they have written no books who told you so who told you there were no learned blacks and supposing it were so if none but authors are men the whole human race is different from us shall i tell you why there are no authors or men of learning among the negroes what has made you what you are education and circumstancesnow where are the negroes favoured by either consider them wherever they are to be foundin africa wretchedly enslaved by domestic tyrants in our islands perpetual martyrs in the southern united states the meanest of slaves in the northern domestics in europe universally contemned every where proscribed like the jews in a word every where in a state of debasement i have been told that there are blacks of property in the northern parts of america but these like the other settlers are no more than sensible farmers or tradersthere are no authors3 among them because there are few rich and idle people in america what spring of action could raise a negro from his debased condition the road to glory and honor is impassible to him what then should he write for besides the blacks have reason to detest the sciences for their oppressors cultivate them but they do not make them better shall we say that the indians or arabs are not our equals because they despise both our arts and our sciences or the quakers because they neither respect academies nor wits in short if you will deny the negroes souls energy sensibility gratitude or beneficence i oppose you to yourself i might quote your own anecdote of mr langdons negro and abundance of other well known facts in favour of the blacks you may find some striking ones in the abb raynals philosophical history one of them would have been sufficient the negro who killed himself when his master who had injured him was in his power was superior to epictetus and the existence of a single negro of so sublime a character ennobles all his kind but how could you judge whether the blacks were different from the whites who saw them only in a state of slavery and wretchedness do we estimate beauty by the figure of a laplander magnanimity by the soul of a courtier or intelligence by the stupidity of an esquimaux if the traces of humanity were so much weakened and effaced in the negroes that you did not recognize them i conclude not that they do not belong to our species but that they must have been cruelly tormented to reduce them to this state of degeneracy i do not conclude that they are not men but that the europeans who kidnap the blacks are not worthy of the name you consider what precautions it may be necessary to take to avoid the danger which might attend a general emancipation of the negroes i shall not now enter into a discussion of this nice question but reserve it for another work yet i must say in a word that the negroes will never be our friends will never be men until they are possessed of all our rights until we are upon an equality civil liberty is the boundary between good and evil order and disorder happiness and misery ignorance and knowledge if we would make the negroes worthy of us we must raise them to our level by giving them this liberty thus the chief inconvenience you expect will follow the emancipation of the negroes may be avoided that although free they will remain a distinct species a distinct and dangerous body this objection will vanish when we intermix with them and boldly efface every distinction unless this is the case i foresee torrents of blood spilt and the earth disputed between the whites and blacks as america was between the europeans and savages perhaps and it is no extravagant ideaperhaps it might be more prudent more humane to send the blacks back again to their native country settle them there encourage their industry and assist them to form connections with europe and america the celebrated doctor fothergill conceived this plan and the society for the abolition of slavery at london have carried it into execution at sierra leone time and perseverance will discover the policy and utility of this settlement if it should succeed the blacks will quit america insensibly and sierra leone become the centre from whence general civilization will spread over all africa perhaps sir you will place these thoughts upon the negroes with those declamations you are pleased to ridicule but what is the epithet of declaimer to me if i am right if i make an impression upon my readers if i cause remorse into the breast of a single slaveholder in a word if i contribute to accelerate the general impulse toward liberty you disapprove the application of eloquence to this subject you think nothing can affect it but exertions of cool reason what is eloquence but the language of reason and sensibility when man is oppressed he struggles he complains he moves our passions and bears down all opposition such eloquence can perform wonders and should be employed by those who undertake to plead the cause of the unfortunate who spend their days in continual agony or he will make no impressioni do not conceive how any man can display wit instead of feeling upon this distracting subject amuse with an antithesis instead of forcible reasoning and only dazzle where he ought to warm i have no conception how a sensible and thinking being can see a fellowcreature tortured and torn to pieces perhaps his poor wife bathed in tears with a wretched infant sucking her shriveled breast at his side i say i have no conception how he can behold such a sight with indifference how unagonized and convulsed with rage and indignation he can have the barbarity to descend to jesting notwithstanding your observations upon the negroes conclude with a jest it will be an easy matter say you to add ten or twelve pages to these few reflections which may be considered as a concert composed only of principal parts con corni ad libertum i hope there is nothing cruel because there is nothing studied in this connection this inconsiderate manner but how could such a comparison come into the head of a man of feeling it is the sad effect of wit as i said before it contracts the soul ever glancing over agreeable objects it is unfeeling when intruded upon by wretchednessuneasy to obliterate the shocking idea and elude the groans of nature it rids itself of both by a jest the humane benezet would never have connected this idea of harmony with the sound of a negro drivers whip having proved that you have wronged the quakers and the negroes i shall proceed to shew that you have equally injured mankind and the peoplecritical examination of the marquis de chastelluxs travels in northamerica 1782 translated from the french of jean p verre brissot de warville 1788 pp 5163 footnotes 1 this jefferies was the most infamous chief justice that ever existed in england charles ii and james ii well acquainted with his talents for chicane his debauchery and bloodthirstiness his baseness and his crimes made use of him to exterminate with the sword of law all those worthy men who defended the constitution from their tyranny i often quote the history of england unhappily for us it is too little known in france 2 most authors who have not studied the rights of men fall into this error i have remarked elsewhere vol ii of the journ du licee no 4 page 222 that a writer who notwithstanding deserves our esteem for having written against the despotism of the turkish government has suffered himself to be drawn into it m le baron de tott says that the moldavians are thievish mean and faithless to translate these words into the language of truth we must say the turks the masters of the moldavians are unjust robbers villains and tyrants and that the moldavians revenge themselves by opposing deceit to oppression etc thus the people are almost everywhere wrongfully accused 3 there was however a negro author at london whose productions are not

traite des ngres et sur les funestes effets de lesclavage slavery as seen by henry wansey in this state he was then at worcester the negroes are free and happy are electors but not elected to offices of state their education however is the same as the whites no negro child is suffered to be endentured beyond twentyfour years of age we observe a school by the roadside in almost every parish and out of it run negro boys and girls as well as white children without any distinction a road branched off here to our right hand leading to albany about 60 miles distant i now observe six or eight negroes working together in a field well dressed as other people notwithstanding they are here free and admitted to equal privileges with the white people yet they love to associate with each other it is observed that they are naturally lazier and will not work so hard as a white servantperhaps the remembrance of former compulsive service may make them place a luxury in idleness nor do they yet seem to feel their importance in society this is a portion of inheritance reserved to the next generation of them came on to hartford here i staid two days that i might have time to inspect the woolen manufactory of this place and attend the debates of the house of representatives of this state two very interesting subjects were in debatea bill brought in to repeal a law passed in october last to order that the money arising from the sale of their lands between the ohio and lake erie should be appropriated to increase the salaries of the ministers of the gospel and the masters of schools and another bill for its second reading to provide for those poor and sick negroes who having been freed from slavery might be unprovided for and that till the master was exculpated by receiving a certificate from the state that negro was discharged in perfect health it should be incumbent on the master to continue to take care of him during sickness or at least pay the expenses of his cure i was much pleased to see a legislature extend its humanity and care so far after our breakfast which was not a very good one we set off for elizabeth town near which on the right is governor livingstones handsome house this is six miles from newark i observed several negro houses low buildings of one story detached from the family house for the slaves from their pilfering disposition are not allowed to sleep in the same houses with their masters slavery although many regulations have been made to moderate its severity is not yet abolished in the new jerseys most of the families of new york have black servants i should suppose that nearly one fifth of the inhabitants are negroes most of whom are free and many in good circumstanceshenry wansey fas the journal of an excursion to the

ides mont paru le moins liberales il est donc naturel que les loix qui dans tous les pays suivent plus ou moins lopinion gnrale manquent aussi de libralit cet gard on peut concevoir comment dans les tats du sud le grand nombre des esclaves rend leur mancipation difficile et comment cette difficult dmancipation donne pretexte lopinion de la necessit de loix extrmement svres contre eux mais dans ltat de newyorck o sur une population de plus de quatre cent mille mes on ne compte pas vingt mille ngres il est impossible de comprendre quels si grands obstacles lemancipation peut rencontrer et sur quoi lon peut fonder lopinion quiil faut pour ce petit nombre de ngres des loix plus svres que pour les hommes dune autre couleur quoiquil en soit une loi qui nest pas plus ancienne que 1788 confirme ltat desclavage pour tout ngre multre our mtif esclave lpoque o elle a t rendue dclare esclave tout enfant n ou natre dune femme esclave autorise la vente des esclaves et les soumet pour les petits crimes un jugement que lon peut appeler prvotal des juges de paix qui peuvent les condamner lemprisonnement ou aux coups de fouet un article de cette loi les assuejtit ce genre de jugement et cette espce de sentence pour avoir frapp un blanc sans faire exception du cas o le blanc serait laggresseur la faveur du jury est cependant accorde lesclave si le crime dont il est accus peut emporter peine de mort il est aussi admis en tmoignage dans les affaires criminelles o dautres ngres sont impliqus la nouvelle jurisprudence criminelle fonde sur les principes dhumanit et de justice ne dtruit aucune des dispositions rellement injustes et barbares contenues dans cette loi cependant les esclaves sont gnralement traits avec plus de douceur par leurs matres dans ltat de new yorck et moins surchargs de travail que dans les tats du midi les moeurs prvalent cet gard sur la rigidit des loix mais les moeurs y sont aussi comme dans beaucoup dautres tats de lamerique imprgnes davidit et davarice cette disposition seule y empche labolition de lesclavage elle est frquemment propose dans la lgislature et jusquici tout moyen mme prparatoire y a t rejett quoique la proportion des hommes libres aux esclaves soit telle que le plus grand nombre des habitans de ltat de newyorck ne possde pas desclaves le petit nombre de ceux qui en possdent sont les plus riches les plus grands propritaires et dans ltat de newyorck comme ailleurs ils ont la principale influence le respect d la proprit est larme avec laquelle on combat toute proposition que tient laffranchissement jai entendu un des hommes de loi les plus clairs et dont tout autre gard les opinions sont librales soutenir que ce serait attenter la proprit que de dclarer libres mme les enfans natre des femmes esclaves parce que disaitil les matres qui out achet ou hrit des esclaves les possdent dans la confiance que leur issue sera leur proprit utile et disponible ainsi quand on dit en virginie quon ne peut y changer le sort de lesclavage quen exportant alafois tous les ngres de ltat on dit newyorck quon ne peut y penser abolir lesclage ni rien faire de prparatoire cette intention sans payer chaque possesseur desclaves le prix actuel de la valeur de ses ngres jeunes et vieux et le prix estim de leur descendance suppose cest sans doute opposer labolition de lesclavage tous les obstacles imaginables cest se montrer bien ennemi de cette abolition cependant lobstacle prsent par les citoyens de newyorck est moins difficile vaincre en admenttant le principe de la ncessit dun ddommagement donn aux matres pour les ngres affranchir et en valuant chaque ngre cent trente dollars la somme totale ne serait que de trois millions de dollars ce prix serait encore susceptible de reduction par le puissant motif dintrt et dhonneur public auquel chaque membre de la socit doit faire des sacrifices la question de la proprit des enfans natre ne tiendrait pas un quartdheure de discussion si elle tait agite devant la legislature enfin cet affranchissement qui ne devrait tre fait que par degrs coterait ltat des sacrifices moins grands encore et dont la succession les rendrait presquimperceptibles aux finances de ltat qui ne pourraient dailleurs avoir un plus saint emploi a newyorck comme ailleurs laffranchissement des ngres doit avoir pour but le bonheur de ltat son bon ordre le bonheur mme des ngres quon veut affranchir un affranchissement trop prompt trop subitement gnral manquerait ces differens buts de premiere ncessit je ne rpterai pas ici ce que jai dit ailleurs cet gard et ce que tant dautres ont dit avant moi la dpense pour ltat serait donc rduite de bien petites sommes en les comparant avec lutilit et le devoir de cette opration mais tant que ltat de newyorck entour des exemples du connecticut du massachusetts et de pensylvanie ne fait rien qui conduise cette libration tant quil semble approuver par le silence ou les refus de sa legislature la permanence de lesclavage il laisse sa constitution et ses loix fltries dune tche que lon peut sans exageration dire deshonorante puisquelle ne peut tre excuse ni pallie par aucune des circonstances o se trouve cet tat limportation dans ltat de newyorck desclaves trangers est prohibe par la mme loi qui confirme lesclavage de ceux qui y existaient lpoque o elle a t rendue ainsi cette disposition de la loi et la manire douce dont sont

rochefoucauldliancourt il est natural de supposer quun ngre esclave fatigu de travail depuis le commencement de lanne jusqu la fin oblig sous peine du fouet daller aux champs quil soit o non en tat de sant ne voye dans la libert que la facult de ne plus travailler tant quil tait esclave il tait plus ou moins mal nourri mais il ltait sans aucun soin de sa part et sans quun travail plus assidu plus actif lui valut une meilleure nourriture ou un meilleur nourriture ou un meilleur vtement le travail ntait donc pour lui quune peine sans tre jamais un moyen de bien tre il est donc il doit donc tre paresseux et imprvoyant il jouit des premiers momens de sa libert en ne travaillant point car le fouet ne claque plus ses oreilles les besoins se font sentir aucune ducation ne lui a t donne que celle de lesclavage qui enseigne tromper voler comme mentir il cherche satisfaire ses besoins auxquels son travail na pas pourvu en drobant quelques bleds quelques provisions ses voisins il devient recleur des ngres esclaves tout cela peut et doit tre mais ne doit dgouter de laffranchissement progressif des ngres que ceux ne veulent pas penser quavec des soins prparatoires et surtout des soins gnreux qui auraient pour objet une mancipation gnrale successive approprie au nombre des ngres dans le pays et plusieurs autres circonstances la plus grande quantit de ces inconvniens serait evite et le serait totalement pour la gnration future si elle ne pouvait ltre pour la prsente mais comment esprer une philanthropie si prvoyante de ceux qui ne voyent que leur intrt du moment et qui le croyent bless dans ltat de maryland les esclaves sont jugs par les mmes tribunaux que les blancs et comme eux par larbitrage des juris les punitions pour les noirs sont plus svres mais les moeurs sont douces au moins dans la partie du maryland o je suis a prsent et elles prvalent sur la rigueur des loix jai t tmoin dun fait qui prouve que lhumanit des juges et le dsir de rendre une exacte justice les occupent pour les accuss esclaves comme pour les blancs une ngresse est en prison accuse davoir voulu empoisonner sa matresse et davoir empoisonn un enfant sa matresse est son accusatrice cest une femme dune bonne reputation dans le pays appartenant une famille trsetendue dans le comt et y ayant dailleurs beaucoup dinfluence les juges craignant leffet de cette influence sur les juris ont profit de la facult quils out de renvoyer le jugement la cour gnrale du district qui se tient soixante milles de chester pour donner laccuse toute la chance possible dun jugement sain et impartial il ny a encore aucune mesure prise en maryland pour laffranchissement progressif des esclaves quelques hommes bien intentionnes esprent amener la legislature dans peu de temps une dmarche cet gard mais

every thing they can want on their estates amongst the slaves are found tailors shoemakers carpenters smiths turners wheelwrights weavers tanners etc i have seen patterns of excellent coarse woolen cloth made in the country by slaves and a variety of cotton manufacturers amongst the rest good nankeen cotton grows here extremely well the plants are often killed by frost in winter but they always produce abundantly the first year in which they are sown the cotton from which nankeen is made is of a particular kind naturally of a yellowish color the large estates are managed by stewards and overseers the proprietors just amusing themselves with seeing what is going forward the work is done wholly by slaves whose numbers are in this part of the country more than double that of white persons the slaves on the large plantations are in general very well provided for and treated with mildness during three months nearly that i was in virginia but two or three instances of ill treatment towards them came under my observation their quarters the name whereby their habitations are called are usually situated one or two hundred yards from the dwelling house which gives appearance of a village to the residence of every plantation in virginia when the estate however is so large as to be divided into several farms then separate quarters are attached to the house of the overseer on each farm adjoining their little habitations the slaves commonly have small gardens and yards of poultry which are all of their property they have ample time to attend to their own concerns and their gardens are generally found well stocked and their flocks of poultry numerous besides the food they raise for themselves they are allowed liberal rations of salted pork and indian corn many of their little huts are comfortably furnished and they are themselves in general extremely well clothed in short their condition is by no means so wretched as might be imagined they are forced to work certain hours in the day but in return they are clothed dieted and lodged comfortably and saved all anxiety about provision for their offspring still however let the condition of the slave be made ever so comfortable as long as he is conscious of being the property of another man who has it in his power to dispose of him according to the dictates of caprice as long as he hears people around him talking about the blessings of liberty and considers that he is in a state of bondage it is not to be supposed that he can feel equally happy with the freeman it is immaterial under what form slavery presents itself whenever it appears there is ample cause for humanity to weep at the sight and to lament that men can be found so forgetful of their own situations as to live regardless of the blessings of their fellow creatures with respect to the policy of holding slaves in any country on account of the depravity of morals which it necessarily occasions besides the many other evil consequences attendant upon it so much has already been said by others that it is needless here to make comments on the subject the number of the slaves increases most rapidly so that there is scarcely any state but what is overstocked this is a circumstance complained of by every planter as the maintenance of more than are requisite for the culture of the estate is attended with great expense motives of humanity deter them from selling the poor creatures or turning them adrift from the spot where they have been born and brought up in the midst of friends and relations what i have here said respecting the condition and treatment of slaves appertains it must be remembered to those only who are upon the larger plantations in virginia the lot of such as are unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of the lower class of white people and of hard taskmasters in towns is very different in the carolinas and georgia again slavery presents itself in very different colors from what it does even in its worst form in virginia i am told that it is no uncommon thing there to see gangs of negroes staked at a horse race and to see these unfortunate beings bandied about from one set of drunken gamblers to another for days together how much to be deprecated are the laws which suffer such abuses to exist yet these are the laws enacted by the people who boast of their love of liberty and independence and who presume to say that it is in the breasts of americans alone that the blessings of freedom are held in just estimationisaac weld jr travels through the states of north america and the provinces of upper and lower canada 1795 1796 and 1797 london 1799 john daviss thoughts on slavery the negroes on the plantation including houseservants and children amounted to a hundred of whom the average price being respectively seventy pounds made them aggregately worth seven thousand to their possessor two families lived in one hut and such was their unconquerable propensity to steal that they pilfered from each other i have heard masters lament this defect in their negroes but what else can be expected from man in so degraded a condition that among the ancients the same word implied both a slave and a thief since the introduction of the culture of cotton in the state of south carolina the race of negroes has increased both men and women work in the field and the labour of the rice plantation formerly prevented the pregnant negroes from bringing forth a longlived offspring it may be established as a maxim that on a plantation where there are many children the work has been moderate of genius in negroes many instances may be recorded it is true that mr jefferson has pronounced the poems of phillis wheatley below the dignity of criticism and it is seldom safe to differ in judgment from the author of notes on virginia but her conceptions are often lofty and her versification often surpasses with unexpected refinement ladd the carolina poet in enumerating the bards of his country dwells with encomium on wheatleys polished verse nor is his praise undeserved for often it will be found to glide in the stream of melody her lines on imagination have been quoted with rapture by imley of kentucky and steadman the guinea traveler but i have ever thought her happiest production the goliath of gath of ignatius sancho mr jefferson also speaks neglectingly and remarks that he substitutes sentiment for argumentation but i know not that argumentation is required in a familiar epistle and sancho i believe has only published his correspondence john davis travels of four years and a half in the united states of america during 1798 1799 1800 1801 1802 p 86 observations of robert sutcliff i had the curiosity to look into some of their little habitations but all that i examined were wretched in the extreme and far inferior to many indian cottages i have seen i slept at c as and this morning set out for fredericksburg being accompanied by his young man our road lying through the woods the greater part of the way at the place where we dined we were waited on by two mulatto girls whose only clothing appeared to be loose garments of cotton and woollen cloth girt round the waist with a small cord i had observed that this was the common dress of the working female negroes in the fields but when engaged in business in the house it seemed hardly sufficient to cover them in the yard i observed a number of slaves engaged in the management of a still employed in making spirits from cider here again i had the curiosity to look into some of the negro huts which like those i had seen presented little else but dirt and rags we came to fredericksburg and lodged at fishers tavern the next morning i was waked early by the cries of a poor negro who was undergoing a severe correction previously to his going to work on taking a walk on the banks of the rappahannock the river on which the town is seated i stepped into one of the large tobacco warehouses which are built here for the reception and inspection of that plant before it is permitted to be exported on entering into conversation with an inspector as he was employed in looking over a parcel of tobacco he lamented the licentiousness which he remarked so generally prevailed in this town he said that in his remembrance the principal part of the inhabitants were emigrants from scotland and that it was considered so reproachful to the white inhabitants if they were found to have illicit connection with their female slaves that their neighbors would shun the company of such as of persons whom it was a reproach to be acquainted the case was now so much altered that he believed there were but few slave holders in the place who were free from guilt in this respect and that it was now thought but little of such was the brutality and hardness of heart which this evil produced that many amongst them paid no more regard to selling their own children by their females slaves or even their brothers and sisters in the same line than they would do to the disposal of a cow or a horse or any other property in the brute creation to so low a degree of degradation does the system of negro slavery sink the white inhabitants who are unhappily engaged in itrobert sutcliff travels in some parts of north america in years 1804 1805 1806 pp 3752 some letters of richard allen and absalom jones to dorothy ripley philadelphia 1st 5th month 1803naming my concern to some of my solid friends to have a meeting with the africans i influenced them to send for absalom jones the black bishop and richard allen the methodist episcopal preacher who also was a coloured man and the principal person of that congregation a jones complied with my request and appointed a meeting for me on first day evening which was a solid time where many were deeply affected with the softening power of the lord who unloosed my tongue to proclaim of his love and goodness to the children of men without respect to person or nation there was a respectable number of coloured people well dressed and very orderly who conducted themselves as if they were desirous of knowing the mind of the lord concerning them the first and greatest commandment of jesus christ the lawgiver came before me thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind which i endeavoured to enforce as their duty to their creator who alone could make them happy by his blessing through their obedience to his lawful command my own experience of thus loving him i thought would illustrate it therefore added it to shew the possibility of pleasing him and obtaining his divine favor which was our interest and duty as soon as we were able to distinguish right from wrong to see them have this good house for worship i told them rejoiced me much and encouraged such as were servants present to be faithful in their situation and seek the blessing of god that at the last they might be happy in the enjoyment of his love forever supplicating the throne of mercy in their behalf my spirit was deeply humbled and i felt power to plead with the father on the account of the africans every where who were captivated by the oppressive power of men when we had separated my mind was much relieved from the weight which pressed my spirit while i had contemplated the matter desiring to move by special direction of god a letter which i received from bethel church madam i have proposed to the board of trustees of bethel church your request respecting your speaking in our church they have candidly considered the same and after due investigation the board unanimously concludes that as it is diametrically opposite to the letter and spirit of the rules of society in particular and the discipline in general of the methodist episcopalian church they therefore are sorry to inform you that it is not in their power to comply with your request i am madam with much respect yours c richd allen may 11 1803 after r allen had sent me this letter by way of denial the lord commanded me to stand still for i should most assuredly have his place to testify his goodness there putting the letter into my pocket i silently waited for the answer of promise and while i was thus watching the fulfilment of gods word there came into my friends house j p p two men who enquired if i could not be satisfied without an appointment with r allens people i said no for that i believed it was required of me by god they enquired if i had not received a letter as a denial which i marvelled at having shewn it to no person living i answered their question by handing the letter to them which when they had read it they returned and signified they would go themselves to see after an opportunity and obtained permission after the minister had finished his sermon he being desired to be concise to accomodate a stranger who was then concerned for them i went to the meeting or their church and heard a short methodist sermon which i thought very instructive and added thereunto respecting the conversion of a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship this pleased them so much when it was opened that they were willing that i should have another meeting on the second day evening at seven which i attended and was brought into great difficulty through an intoxicated soldier pressing by the crowd which stood without a number of friends being there were unsettled fearing lest the house would come down upon us and for my part i was actually afraid of satans malice lest we should perish in this storm which he raised in a moment the disquietude of the people made me tremble and shake every limb not knowing what course to betake myself to for the preservation of us each i therefore gave up speaking but this only encouraged the accuser of the brethren who had come there in the hearts of many as well as in the poor drunkard who was taken away and confined pouring out my soul to god i vowed to serve him yet more faithfully if he would quell the rage of the adversary and cause us to depart in peace and i was instantly directed to prostrate myself before him in faith believing that no harm should befall any of us at that time which doing commanded the care of almighty god over us and the blessing of the most high to rest upon us continuing wrestling for some time knowing this was a powerful weapon against satan for thus interrupting us in our solemn engagement with god when i had prayed by the aid of his holy spirit which calmed the minds of the people i thought i would leave the subject until i came back again1 and so come suddenly upon the monster if it was the will of god but he pretended that he would do terrible things if i came thither again so i suppose king apollyon and i shall have a strong battle to combat before i enter the house of god for i mean to war with him on his own ground and gain the victory before i enter there again concluding the meeting sooner than was expected r allen stopped the congregation and told them it was no new thing which had happened to us then for in the days of old when the sons and daughters of god met together satan presented himself also to interrupt their peace i was much pleased to hear what was advanced as it shewed the preacher although a coloured man to have a knowledge of divine things and able to attack the enemy of our souls in a suitable degree feeling desirous to follow the shepherd of my soul and seeing no further work at this time for me i leave this city in peace requesting the lord to bless the seed sown in great weakness and to water it with the descending showers of his spiritual rain that the glory may arise to him alone who is worthy to be praised by every creature but especially by a worm whom he has preserved thus far from the destructive power of sin and satan i trust the lord will repay each here who have contributed to comfort my soul in the day of distress and heavy travail and i beseech him of his infinite mercy to forgive such as have blindly persecuted me by saying unjust things of me which they have reported merely to gratify the curiosity of others without considering the waste of their precious moments or that they will be accountable at the last for every idle word that they may speak while on earth if not repented of by a gracious visitation of gods humbling power which they will find painful when his judgment takes place in them to weigh all their words thoughts and actionsphiladelphia 5th month 1803 i have been five weeks and four days in new york and the neighbouring plains and have met with sympathizing friends to relieve my mind when full of anxious care concerning the vineyard of the lordseveral have told me that i was one of those strangers who should feed the flock of israel by the appointment of god which revives me when i consider how significant a creature i am in my own eyes the yearly meeting was large and attended by some precious ministers whose testimonies will cause them to be written on my heart as living epistles how do i feel myself united with spiritual worshippers who desire to ascribe all glory to the father through the sons reigning power in them by the sanctifying influence of the holy ghost which leads them into the depth of selfabasement and gathers all their powers to centre them in the god of all grace and glory i rejoice that ever i met with this people whom i often lament for because so many live not in the pure principle of truth which if they as a body did the whole earth would soon be filled with the knowledge of the lord o that my advantages which i have had up and down among this people may lead me to honor their god whom the pure in heart are concerned to worship continually i have had three large meetings with the africans in this city and have great reason to be thankful that the lord aided me with his spirit helping my infirmities in the hour of necessity when i stood in need of his assistance standing up to exalt the great redeemer who died for all nations that the lord would bless my little labour of love among this people whom i have secretly mourned for i cannot avoid commending the citizens of new york and philadelphia for their help to those that have been greatly oppressed driving slavery out of their states that they may have the peace of god and his blessing upon the heads of their children and childrens children i trust also to see the efforts of individuals crowned with a blessing in the southern states where barrenness of the land bespeaks the proverty and wretchedness of thousands of its inhabitants who might enjoy the smile of heaven if they would learn to fear god and love their neighbor when comparing those states one with the other what a vast difference there is between them in the outward appearance of things but i trust the minds of the people to the southward are not like the barren appearance of many parts i have already travelled or may yet have to do for i perceive the lord intends me to return back to discharge my duty to him and the people up and down i have received the following letters from philadelphia and think them worthy to make up a page or two in my life letter from absalom jones black bishop of the episcopal church in philadelphia addressed to dorothy ripley at new york dated philadelphia june 3 1803 dear friend it is with pleasure that i now sit down to inform you that your kind and very affectionate letter came safe to hand and am happy to hear that kind providence has conducted you so far on your journey in health of body as well as of mind and i trust that the lord will continue to be your guide and that your labours may prove as great a blessing to the inhabitants of newyork as they have been to numbers in this city your letter i read with care and attention as well as many others of my congregation and i heartily thank you for your friendly advice and godly admonitions believing them to have been given in that love which purifies the heart i am very sensible that the charge committed to my care is very great and am also fully convinced of my own inability for so great an undertaking and i do assure you that when i was called to the task i trembled at the idea and was ready to say who am i but when i consider that god can send by whom he will and as you very justly have observed he sometimes makes use of the feeblest instruments for the promotion of truth i say under these considerations i was led to believe that the lord would perfect strength in my weakness and glory be to his everadorable name for it i have cause to believe my labour has not been altogether in vain you wish to know the number i consider to be under my care our list of members contains about five hundred although we have a great many more who constantly attend worship in our church of whom i have a comfortable hope that they will be brought unto the knowledge of the truth my wife joins me in love i remain with sentiments of high esteem and respect your esteemed friend absalom jones letter from an african minister resident in philadelphia addressed to dorothy ripley philadelphia 24th of 6th mo 1803 friend ripley i received thy epistle dated newyork 26th of 5th month with much joy thanks and satisfaction and am thankful for thy kind spiritual advice and grateful for thy concern for me and my people with the assistance of the good spirit i will attend to thy serious admonitions in the lord and listen to the small still voice of christ within as thou dost observe in thy epistle for it is he that must enable me to observe his holy law written on the heart by his spirit i wish to take thy sisterly counsel but o my abounding weakness i wish to be more sensible of it so that i alone may feel it i would hide it from my friends but they are too eagleeyed not to discover it yet they have the charity to bear with mei often bow at the footstool of divine mercy that i may obtain strength to overcome corrupt naturenone knows but myself my strivings to walk in the narrow way in which the poor worm has no desire to rob god of his honor i see the beauty of nakedness to be far superior than to be clothed with rags of selfrighteousness thou enquirest how many communicants there are in our church the precise number of my communicants is 457 all our members are communicants there is a communion of saints which exceeds all formality and which even the apostles were ignorant of when they gave an account to their master on their return from their mission and told him we saw men casting out devils in thy name and we forbade them because they followed not us yet i still continue of the same mind that it would be best for thee to be a member of some religious societythe teachings of priscilla and aquila have been found profitable to the eloquent and wise the members of the african methodist episcopal church called bethel live in love and harmony with each other my fellow laborer absalom jones joins me in a salutation of love to thee with desires for thy growth and increase in the favor of god he says he would have written to thee had he known of thy continuance at new york praying god to bless and make thee instrumental in promoting his glory and the good of souls i remain thine c richard allen letter from an african resident in philadelphia to dorothy ripley may 17 1803 respected friend i am perhaps presumptuous in troubling you to read this but cannot let slip an opportunity of addressing you with what i wish you to know even when you have arrived at your native country and may contemplate on a subject which i hope will not displease you and i will thank heaven i have it in my power to let one amongst the people called quakers2 see written by the hand of an african the sentiments of his soul i mean only to trouble you with the obligations that race of people myself amongst that great multitude are to you indebted and may the unremitting pains which have been taken not fall to the ground we have been oppressed with cruelty and the heavy taskmasters in the west indies and the southern states of america for many centuries back with not only the horrible weight of bondage but have been subject to heavy iron chains too heavy to bear had not the creator of all things framed our constitutions to bear them and all the deep cuts and lashes the inhumanhearted drivers please to mangle us with had not the alldirecting hand of providence made us come under the notice of the friends who formed an abolition society for our relief many thousands of us would be dragging out our lives in wretchedness like those of our brethren who have never yet tasted the sweet cup of liberty yet while the nations of europe are contending to catch the draught the african is forbidden to lift up his head towards it every man has a right to his liberty and we must by the ties of nature come under the title of men but are dragged from our native land in our old age or in our infancy and sold as the brute to the planters the infant dragged from its parents and the husband from wife and children and hurried into the cane field to give independence to their owners and annex abundance to their riches and how is this that god created us amongst the rest of human beings and yet man would level us with the brute we were not all born christians but many have become so and i pray heaven many thousands of us may be received at the bar of god amongst the righteous at his right hand and with you glorify him in heaven for ever i pray that the africans may enjoy his holy privileges and let their light shine before men the cross3 you met with in your sermon at bethel african church grieved me much but it originated with white men had it been one of my complexion it would prey on my feelings to the very heart but i hope you will forget it if i was a converted soul in the lord i could address you on a more spiritual subject but alas i am an unfortunate being not born a second time yet weak as i am the prayers of an unconverted african shall be offered to heaven for your happiness on earth and in the world to come life everlasting and may the vessel in which you may embark for england be attended with a fair and pleasant passage and land you safe on its shores and when you shall lay your head on a dying pillow to leave this troublesome world may you be surrounded with a blessed convoy of angels to attend you to the throne of god i am yours of the african race the extraordinary conversion and religious experience of dorothy ripley with her first voyage in america 132144 footnotes 1 from england 2 he expected i was a member of that society which i never yet have been 3 the cross here mentioned has an allusion to an attempt made by an intoxicated soldier to disturb our peace who caused great confusion for a few moments but kneeling in the midst of this tempestuous storm god instantly caused a calm so that no one received harm book reviews the aftermath of the civil war in arkansas by powell clayton governor of arkansas 1868 to 1871 neale publishing company new york 1915 pp 378 looking at the title of this work the student of history would expect that same scientific treatment which is observed in so many of the reconstruction studies on the contrary he finds in this a mere volume of memoirs of a political leader completed in his eightysecond year the work gives an account of the authors own administration as governor of arkansas also of those events that commenced before and extended into it and those that occurred during that period and continued beyond it in view of the fact that he a man of wellknown partisan proclivities may be charged with criticising his defenceless and dead contemporaries the author says that he endeavored to substantiate every controvertible and important conclusion to do this he collected an immense amount of documentary evidence from which he selected the most appropriate for that purpose the writer made use of certain documents in the library of congress and had frequent recourse to the arkansas gazette the book as a whole is essentially political history it is chiefly concerned with the murphy government the organization and operations of the klu klux klan martial law and the peculiar situation in the counties of crittenden and conway the subjects of immigration education state aid to railroads and the funding of the state debt are all mentioned but they suffer because of the preference given to the discussion of political questions when one has read the book he is still uninformed as to what was the actual working of the economic and social forces in arkansas during this period this work however is valuable for several reasons in the first place whether the reader agrees with the author or not he gathers from page to page facts which throw light on other conditions moreover consisting mainly of a discussion of extracts from various records it is a good source book for students who have not access to the documents the author has used further it is important to get the viewpoint of the distinguished author who lived through what he writes of and is now sufficiently far removed from the struggle to study it somewhat sympathetically c r wilson black and white in the southern states by maurice s evans cmglongmans green and company london 1915 pp 209 this book cannot be considered an historical work yet when the author makes a survey of the slavery and reconstruction periods with a view to estimating what the negro has been what has been done for him and what he himself has accomplished it claims the attention of historians from this historic retrospect the author approaches such questions as the negroes grievances their political rights and wrongs blood admixture race hostility and grounds for hope and the like the author has had experiences in south africa and traveled in the united states with a view to studying the condition of the descendants of the african race in this country his effort seems to be to write such a work as some of those of sir h h johnson or w p livingstone he justifies the writing of this work on the grounds that the partisan spirit partial to one race or other permeates most of the writings on this subject feeling that the issues involved are too great he hoped to avoid this that no preconceived ideas or partiality should be allowed to cloud clarity of view or warp the judgment yet although the author speaks well of his good intentions it is apparent that he did not live up to this profession in the first place the work is not scientific facts are not observed and noted with scrupulous care and conclusions are drawn without warranted data to support them on the whole then one must say that this work fails to unravel some knots in this tangled skein of human endeavor and error when after a survey of the history of the negro during the last fifty years an investigator concludes that the negro has shown an incapacity for commerce and finance and that he must not struggle to equip himself in the same way that the white man has one must believe that the writer has not the situation thoroughly in hand the great difficulty of the author seems to be that he did not remain in the country long enough to know it did not give sufficient time to the study of conditions and based his conclusions largely on information obtained from persons who were either too prejudiced or had neither the scientific point of view nor adequate mental development to describe social conditions it is not surprising therefore that the author asserts that the record of the negro during the last fifty years shows that they are chiefly valuable as laborers in drudgery or weak in foresight and thrift and unfit for city life yet he believes that there is some hope for the blacks since they can get work and buy land and thereby become economically independent he calls attention to such injustices as miscegenation lynching unfairness of the courts and discrimination in traveling w r ward samuel coleridgetaylormusician his life and letters by w c berwick sayers cassell and company london 1915 pp 328 in this work we have the first extensive account of samuel coleridgetaylor the author of this volume has succeeded in producing a sympathetic and interesting narrative of the life of one of the greatest musicians of his time taking up his birth and childhood and then his college days ending in the romance which attached him to a young croydon girl the author does not delay in bringing the reader to a consideration of those fundamentals which made samuel coleridgetaylor famous much space is devoted to coleridgetaylors achievement of success with his ballade in a minor how sir edward elgar extended the promising composer a welcoming hand and arranged for him to write for a concert a short orchestral piece which turned out to be the artists first great success is well described the author emphasizes the barbaric strain and orchestral coloring the prominently marked features which made the composer great the next task of the author is to show how the essential beauty naive simplicity unaffected expression and unforced idealism of longfellows hiawatha stirred the artist and set him composing an unambitious cantata which resulted in hiawathas wedding feast and the song of hiawatha the expressions of enthusiasm and the euologies which crowned the musician as one of the greatest artists that great britain has produced justly constitute a large portion of the work his visit to america is an important chapter of the volume the manner in which the oppressed of his race received him in their troubled land is treated in detail and the names of the persons and organizations that arose to welcome him are given honorable mention the author brings out too that so impressed was coleridgetaylor with the frank recognition of pure music in america that he once contemplated the desirability of emigrating to this land the book abounds with letters and extracts from publications which enable the reader to learn for himself how the artists work was appreciated the volume is well illustrated in it appear the early portraits of coleridgetaylors mother of himself and family and home and of the coleridgetaylor society in washington dc not only persons who appreciate music but all who have an intelligent interest in the achievements of the negro should read this work j r davis race orthodoxy in the south and other aspects of the negro problem by thomas pearce bailey phd the neale publishing company new york 1914 the author of this volume has a long intellectual pedigree pedigrees are important in authors who write on the race problem this is particularly true when they attempt to tell us what the orthodox opinion of the south is regarding the negro much that passes for southern opinion on the negro is too violent to be taken at its face value other interpretations of the south have too frequently been the individual views of eminent men of southern origin who no longer hold orthodox views the author discusses some of these interpretations and criticises them there are four principal types there is the philosophical view represented by edgar gardiner murphys the basis of ascendancy mr murphy is one of the choicest specimens of noble character that the south has produced but he came under northern influences and his book represents a struggle between northern and southern points of view the first part of his book seems to be in the main prosouthern and defensive of the south while the latter part becomes largely northern and critical of the south he does not succeed in the opinion of the author in synthesizing these two divergent views the second type is sociological represented by the southerner a novel written in the form of an autobiography or perhaps rather an autobiography written in the form of a novel the author is supposed to be walter hines page at present american ambassador to great britain of this book mr bailey says the author is not a southerner of the spirit whatever he may be of the flesh there is something of north carolina and something of massachusetts in his attitude but none of the allinclusive americanism that alone is able to write about the south with sympathy of the heart yet with balanced discrimination to understand the south one must have lived in south carolina and understand the apparent violence of ben tilman or in mississippi the home of senator vardaman the south the orthodox south is today as it was before the war the far south but the sentiments which dominate it are not now as in slavery days the sentiments of the master class but rather those of the poor white man the third type of interpretation is represented here by uncle toms cabin the criticsm of this book is so subtle that it is difficult to indicate the outlines of it in a single paragraph the difficulty with mrs stowes interpretation of the south and the negro is that she just as certain southern humanitarians of the present day is inclined to treat the negroes as a class she does not regard them as a race a different breed whose blood is a contamination no one says the writer has come within shouting distance of the real negro problem who does not appreciate this distinction indeed almost everything critical that can be alleged against uncle toms cabin springs from the failure of its humanitarian author to sympathize with race consciousness as such finally there is the scientific interpretation of southern sentiment and the race instinct which is back of most southern opinion in regard to the negro this scientific interpretation is represented by boas the mind of primitive man ultimately according to professor boas this phenomenon race instinct is a repetition of the old instinct and fear of the connubium of the patricians and the plebeians of the european nobility and the common people or of the castes of india the emotions and reasoning are the same in every respect to this scientific exposition of the southern attitude mr bailey replies even if it could be scientifically proved that an infusion of negro blood would help the white race the prejudice against a really great branch of the white race like the jews is sufficient warning to us not to confine our discussion of race problems to the question of equality or inequality of physical and mental endowment what then is race orthodoxy where shall we look for a true statement of the attitude of the south on the subject of the negro since none of these attempts at interpretation have done justice to it the racial creed has been expressed at different times in a number of pithy expressions current in the southern states here they are in order as the author gives them blood will tell the white race must dominate the teutonic peoples stand for race purity the negro is inferior and will remain so this is a white mans country let there be no social equality no political equality in matters of civil rights and legal adjustments give the white man as opposed to the colored man the benefit of the doubt in educational policy let the negro have the crumbs that fall from the white mans table let there be such industrial education of the negro as will fit him to serve the white man only southerners understand the negro question let the south settle the negro question the status of peasantry is all the negro may hope for if the races are to live together in peace let the lowest white man count for more than the highest negro the above statements indicate the leadings of providence this statement of the southern creed is practically the common opinion of the south it is not the only opinion it is not perhaps the best opinion but is it right opinion mr bailey thinks it is in its underlying meaning at any rate but not in its present shape his book may be said on the whole to be an interpretation and a justification of this underlying meaning race orthodoxy in the south is take it all in all the most candid statement of the race problem the most searching suggestive and revealing interpretation of the attitude of the southern white man that has ever been written the book is however merely a statement of the problem and not a solution rather it is intended as the author suggests again and again to provoke and stimulatenot discussion heaven forbidbut inquiry investigation in spite of the fact that the author professes his personal loyalty to the dogma upon which race orthodoxy is founded still by stating it in the clear and candid way in which he has in pointing out with unflinching directness the moral culdesac into which it has forced the southern people he has at once enabled and compelled them to put their faith on rational grounds his is the higher criticism in race creeds and it is hard to tell where criticism once started will lead robert e park notes mr monroe n work has brought out the negro year book for 19161917 in keeping with the progress hitherto shown this edition surpasses that of last year here one finds an unusually large collection of statistical material as to the economic social and religious progress of the black race and a brief account of what exceptional negroes have done to distinguish themselves in various fields it contains also a brief history of the negro given in such succinct statements as will please the hurried reader and meet the requirements of those who have not access to reference libraries the striking new feature of the work however is a brief account of what leading thinkers and the press have said about such perplexing problems as the birth of a nation miscegenation and segregation the editor has endeavored to present in popular style a brief account of everything of importance with which the negro has been concerned during the year he has done his task well sold at such a reasonable price as thirtyfive cents a copy this valuable book should find its way to the home of every one who desires to keep himself informed on what the negro is actually achieving the united brethren publishing co huntington ind has published m b butlers my story of the civil war and the underground railroad a native of vermont where he had an opportunity to see many

oppressed people dr c g woodson delivered at the university of chicago in july a lecture on the varying attitude of the white man toward the negro in the united states a happy suggestion my dear dr woodson i am in receipt of the current number of the journal of negro history and am more and more delighted with it i think it furnishes the richest source for available information on the negro that i have yet found the leading article in this number is inspiring as well as illuminating and the idea has come to me that it would be an excellent thing to have history reading circles organized in all our schools for the purpose of systematically reading the journal a hundred or more such organizations with the journal as a text would accomplish two or three very valuable things viz promote the circulation of the journal and disseminate historical knowledge of the race so necessary to give it selfrespect and pride these historical clubs might meet monthly and include others than teachers by all means your work should not lack for funds for keeping it going i hope to interest the colored high school alumni here at its annual meeting next week i shall also call the attention of my teachers
