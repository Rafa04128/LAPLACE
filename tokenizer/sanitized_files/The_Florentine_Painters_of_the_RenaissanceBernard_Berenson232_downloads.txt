by g p putnams sons for revised edition made in the united states of america preface to third edition years have passed since the second edition of this book but as most of this time has been taken up with the writing of my drawings of the florentine painters it has in a sense been spent in preparing me to make this new edition indeed it is to that bigger work that i must refer the student who may wish to have the reasons for some of my attributions there for instance he will find the intricate carli question treated quite as fully as it deserves jacopo del sellajo is inserted here for the first time ample accounts of this frequently entertaining tenthrate painter may be found in articles by hans makowsky mary logan and herbert horne the most important event of the last ten years in the study of italian art has been the rediscovery of an all but forgotten great master pietro cavallini the study of his fresco at s cecilia in rome and of the other works that readily group themselves with it has illuminated with an unhopedfor light the problem of giottos origin and development i felt stimulated to a fresh consideration of the subject the results will be noted here in the inclusion for the first time of cimabue and in the lists of paintings ascribed to giotto and his immediate assistants b b boston november 1908 preface to the second edition the lists have been thoroughly revised and some of them considerably increased botticini pier francesco fiorentino and amico di sandro have been added partly for the intrinsic value of their work and partly because so many of their pictures are exposed to public admiration under greater names botticini sounds too much like botticelli not to have been confounded with him and pier francesco has similarly been confused with piero della francesca thus botticinis famous assumption painted for matteo palmieri and now in the national gallery already passed in vasaris time for a botticelli and the attribution at karlsruhe of the quaint and winning nativity to the sublime unyielding piero della francesca is surely nothing more than the echo of the real authors name most inadequate accounts yet more than can be given here of pier francesco as well as of botticini will be found in the italian edition of cavalcaselles storia della pittura in italia vol vii the latter painter will doubtless be dealt with fully and ably in mr herbert p hornes forthcoming book on botticelli and in this connection i am happy to acknowledge my indebtedness to mr horne for having persuaded me to study botticini of amico di sandro i have written at length in the gazette des beaux arts june and july 1899 fiesole november 1899 contents page the florentine painters of the renaissance 1 index to the works of the principal florentine painters 95 index of places 189 the florentine painters of the renaissance i florentine painting between giotto and michelangelo contains the names of such artists as orcagna masaccio fra filippo pollaiuolo verrocchio leonardo and botticelli put beside these the greatest names in venetian art the vivarini the bellini giorgione titian and tintoret the difference is striking the significance of the venetian names is exhausted with their significance as painters not so with the florentines forget that they were painters they remain great sculptors forget that they were sculptors and still they remain architects poets and even men of science they left no form of expression untried and to none could they say this will perfectly convey my meaning painting therefore offers but a partial and not always the most adequate manifestation of their personality and we feel the artist as greater than his work and the man as soaring above the artist page heading manysidedness of the painters the immense superiority of the artist even to his greatest achievement in any one art form means that his personality was but slightly determined by the particular art in question that he tended to mould it rather than let it shape him it would be absurd therefore to treat the florentine painter as a mere link between two points in a necessary evolution the history of the art of florence never can be as that of venice the study of a placid development each man of genius brought to bear upon his art a great intellect which never condescending merely to please was tirelessly striving to reincarnate what it comprehended of life in forms that would fitly convey it to others and in this endeavour each man of genius was necessarily compelled to create forms essentially his own but because florentine painting was preeminently an art formed by great personalities it grappled with problems of the highest interest and offered solutions that can never lose their value what they aimed at and what they attained is the subject of the following essay ii the first of the great personalities in florentine painting was giotto although he affords no exception to the rule that the great florentines exploited all the arts in the endeavour to express themselves he giotto renowned as architect and sculptor reputed as wit and versifier differed from most of his tuscan successors in having peculiar aptitude for the essential in painting as an art but before we can appreciate his real value we must come to an agreement as to what in the art of figurepaintingthe craft has its own altogether diverse lawsis the essential for figurepainting we may say at once was not only the one preoccupation of giotto but the dominant interest of the entire florentine school page heading imagination of touch psychology has ascertained that sight alone gives us no accurate sense of the third dimension in our infancy long before we are conscious of the process the sense of touch helped on by muscular sensations of movement teaches us to appreciate depth the third dimension both in objects and in space in the same unconscious years we learn to make of touch of the third dimension the test of reality the child is still dimly aware of the intimate connection between touch and the third dimension he cannot persuade himself of the unreality of lookingglass land until he has touched the back of the mirror later we entirely forget the connection although it remains true that every time our eyes recognise reality we are as a matter of fact giving tactile values to retinal impressions now painting is an art which aims at giving an abiding impression of artistic reality with only two dimensions the painter must therefore do consciously what we all do unconsciouslyconstruct his third dimension and he can accomplish his task only as we accomplish ours by giving tactile values to retinal impressions his first business therefore is to rouse the tactile sense for i must have the illusion of being able to touch a figure i must have the illusion of varying muscular sensations inside my palm and fingers corresponding to the various projections of this figure before i shall take it for granted as real and let it affect me lastingly it follows that the essential in the art of paintingas distinguished from the art of colouring i beg the reader to observeis somehow to stimulate our consciousness of tactile values so that the picture shall have at least as much power as the object represented to appeal to our tactile imagination page heading giotto well it was of the power to stimulate the tactile consciousnessof the essential as i have ventured to call it in the art of paintingthat giotto was supreme master this is his everlasting claim to greatness and it is this which will make him a source of highest sthetic delight for a period at least as long as decipherable traces of his handiwork remain on mouldering panel or crumbling wall for great though he was as a poet enthralling as a storyteller splendid and majestic as a composer he was in these qualities superior in degree only to many of the masters who painted in various parts of europe during the thousand years that intervened between the decline of antique and the birth in his own person of modern painting but none of these masters had the power to stimulate the tactile imagination and consequently they never painted a figure which has artistic existence their works have value if at all as highly elaborate very intelligible symbols capable indeed of communicating something but losing all higher value the moment the message is delivered giottos paintings on the contrary have not only as much power of appealing to the tactile imagination as is possessed by the objects representedhuman figures in particularbut actually more with the necessary result that to his contemporaries they conveyed a keener sense of reality of lifelikeness than the objects themselves we whose current knowledge of anatomy is greater who expect more articulation and suppleness in the human figure who in short see much less navely now than giottos contemporaries no longer find his paintings more than lifelike but we still feel them to be intensely real in the sense that they still powerfully appeal to our tactile imagination thereby compelling us as do all things that stimulate our sense of touch while they present themselves to our eyes to take their existence for granted and it is only when we can take for granted the existence of the object painted that it can begin to give us pleasure that is genuinely artistic as separated from the interest we feel in symbols page heading analysis of enjoyment of painting at the risk of seeming to wander off into the boundless domain of sthetics we must stop at this point for a moment to make sure that we are of one mind regarding the meaning of the phrase artistic pleasure in so far at least as it is used in connection with painting what is the point at which ordinary pleasures pass over into the specific pleasures derived from each one of the arts our judgment about the merits of any given work of art depends to a large extent upon our answer to this question those who have not yet differentiated the specific pleasures of the art of painting from the pleasures they derive from the art of literature will be likely to fall into the error of judging the picture by its dramatic presentation of a situation or its rendering of character will in short demand of the painting that it shall be in the first place a good illustration those others who seek in painting what is usually sought in music the communication of a pleasurable state of emotion will prefer pictures which suggest pleasant associations nice people refined amusements agreeable landscapes in many cases this lack of clearness is of comparatively slight importance the given picture containing all these pleasuregiving elements in addition to the qualities peculiar to the art of painting but in the case of the florentines the distinction is of vital consequence for they have been the artists in europe who have most resolutely set themselves to work upon the specific problems of the art of figurepainting and have neglected more than any other school to call to their aid the secondary pleasures of association with them the issue is clear if we wish to appreciate their merit we are forced to disregard the desire for pretty or agreeable types dramatically interpreted situations and in fact suggestiveness of any kind worse still we must even forego our pleasure in colour often a genuinely artistic pleasure for they never systematically exploited this element and in some of their best works the colour is actually harsh and unpleasant it was in fact upon form and form alone that the great florentine masters concentrated their efforts and we are consequently forced to the belief that in their pictures at least form is the principal source of our sthetic enjoyment now in what way we ask can form in painting give me a sensation of pleasure which differs from the ordinary sensations i receive from form how is it that an object whose recognition in nature may have given me no pleasure becomes when recognised in a picture a source of sthetic enjoyment or that recognition pleasurable in nature becomes an enhanced pleasure the moment it is transferred to art the answer i believe depends upon the fact that art stimulates to an unwonted activity psychical processes which are in themselves the source of most if not all of our pleasures and which here free from disturbing physical sensations never tend to pass over into pain for instance i am in the habit of realising a given object with an intensity that we shall value as 2 if i suddenly realise this familiar object with an intensity of 4 i receive the immediate pleasure which accompanies a doubling of my mental activity but the pleasure rarely stops here those who are capable of receiving direct pleasure from a work of art are generally led on to the further pleasures of selfconsciousness the fact that the psychical process of recognition goes forward with the unusual intensity of 4 to 2 overwhelms them with the sense of having twice the capacity they had credited themselves with their whole personality is enhanced and being aware that this enhancement is connected with the object in question they for some time after take not only an increased interest in it but continue to realise it with the new intensity precisely this is what form does in painting it lends a higher coefficient of reality to the object represented with the consequent enjoyment of accelerated psychical processes and the exhilarating sense of increased capacity in the observer hence by the way the greater pleasure we take in the object painted than in itself and it happens thus we remember that to realise form we must give tactile values to retinal sensations ordinarily we have considerable difficulty in skimming off these tactile values and by the time they have reached our consciousness they have lost much of their strength obviously the artist who gives us these values more rapidly than the object itself gives them gives us the pleasures consequent upon a more vivid realisation of the object and the further pleasures that come from the sense of greater psychical capacity furthermore the stimulation of our tactile imagination awakens our consciousness of the importance of the tactile sense in our physical and mental functioning and thus again by making us feel better provided for life than we were aware of being gives us a heightened sense of capacity and this brings us back once more to the statement that the chief business of the figure painter as an artist is to stimulate the tactile imagination the proportions of this small book forbid me to develop further a theme the adequate treatment of which would require more than the entire space at my command i must be satisfied with the crude and unillumined exposition given already allowing myself this further word only that i do not mean to imply that we get no pleasure from a picture except the tactile satisfaction on the contrary we get much pleasure from composition more from colour and perhaps more still from movement to say nothing of all the possible associative pleasures for which every work of art is the occasion what i do wish to say is that unless it satisfies our tactile imagination a picture will not exert the fascination of an everheightened reality first we shall exhaust its ideas and then its power of appealing to our emotions and its beauty will not seem more significant at the thousandth look than at the first my need of dwelling upon this subject at all i must repeat arises from the fact that although this principle is important indeed in other schools it is allimportant in the florentine school without its due appreciation it would be impossible to do justice to florentine painting we should lose ourselves in admiration of its teaching or perchance of its historical importanceas if historical importance were synonymous with artistic significancebut we should never realise what artistic idea haunted the minds of its great men and never understand why at a date so early it became academic page heading giotto and values of touch let us now turn back to giotto and see in what way he fulfils the first condition of painting as an art which condition as we agreed is somehow to stimulate our tactile imagination we shall understand this without difficulty if we cover with the same glance two pictures of nearly the same subject that hang side by side in the florence academy one by cimabue and the other by giotto the difference is striking but it does not consist so much in a difference of pattern and types as of realisation in the cimabue we patiently decipher the lines and colours and we conclude at last that they were intended to represent a woman seated men and angels standing by or kneeling to recognise these representations we have had to make many times the effort that the actual objects would have required and in consequence our feeling of capacity has not only not been confirmed but actually put in question with what sense of relief of rapidly rising vitality we turn to the giotto our eyes scarcely have had time to light on it before we realise it completelythe throne occupying a real space the virgin satisfactorily seated upon it the angels grouped in rows about it our tactile imagination is put to play immediately our palms and fingers accompany our eyes much more quickly than in presence of real objects the sensations varying constantly with the various projections represented as of face torso knees confirming in every way our feeling of capacity for coping with thingsfor life in short i care little that the picture endowed with the gift of evoking such feelings has faults that the types represented do not correspond to my ideal of beauty that the figures are too massive and almost unarticulated i forgive them all because i have much better to do than to dwell upon faults but how does giotto accomplish this miracle with the simplest means with almost rudimentary light and shade and functional line he contrives to render out of all the possible outlines out of all the possible variations of light and shade that a given figure may have only those that we must isolate for special attention when we are actually realising it this determines his types his schemes of colour even his compositions he aims at types which both in face and figure are simple largeboned and massivetypes that is to say which in actual life would furnish the most powerful stimulus to the tactile imagination obliged to get the utmost out of his rudimentary light and shade he makes his scheme of colour of the lightest that his contrasts may be of the strongest in his compositions he aims at clearness of grouping so that each important figure may have its desired tactile value note in the madonna we have been looking at how the shadows compel us to realise every concavity and the lights every convexity and how with the play of the two under the guidance of line we realise the significant parts of each figure whether draped or undraped nothing here but has its architectonic reason above all every line is functional that is to say charged with purpose its existence its direction is absolutely determined by the need of rendering the tactile values follow any line here say in the figure of the angel kneeling to the left and see how it outlines and models how it enables you to realise the head the torso the hips the legs the feet and how its direction its tension is always determined by the action there is not a genuine fragment of giotto in existence but has these qualities and to such a degree that the worst treatment has not been able to spoil them witness the resurrected frescoes in santa croce at florence page heading symbolism of giotto the rendering of tactile values once recognised as the most important specifically artistic quality of giottos work and as his personal contribution to the art of painting we are all the better fitted to appreciate his more obvious though less peculiar meritsmerits i must add which would seem far less extraordinary if it were not for the high plane of reality on which giotto keeps us now what is back of this power of raising us to a higher plane of reality but a genius for grasping and communicating real significance what is it to render the tactile values of an object but to communicate its material significance a painter who after generations of mere manufacturers of symbols illustrations and allegories had the power to render the material significance of the objects he painted must as a man have had a profound sense of the significant no matter then what his theme giotto feels its real significance and communicates as much of it as the general limitations of his art and of his own skill permit when the theme is sacred story it is scarcely necessary to point out with what processional gravity with what hieratic dignity with what sacramental intentness he endows it the eloquence of the greatest critics has here found a darling subject but let us look a moment at certain of his symbols in the arena at padua at the inconstancy the injustice the avarice for instance what are the significant traits he seems to have asked himself in the appearance and action of a person under the exclusive domination of one of these vices let me paint the person with these traits and i shall have a figure that perforce must call up the vice in question so he paints inconstancy as a woman with a blank face her arms held out aimlessly her torso falling backwards her feet on the side of a wheel it makes one giddy to look at her injustice is a powerfully built man in the vigour of his years dressed in the costume of a judge with his left hand clenching the hilt of his sword and his clawed right hand grasping a double hooked lance his cruel eye is sternly on the watch and his attitude is one of alert readiness to spring in all his giant force upon his prey he sits enthroned on a rock overtowering the tall waving trees and below him his underlings are stripping and murdering a wayfarer avarice is a horned hag with ears like trumpets a snake issuing from her mouth curls back and bites her forehead her left hand clutches her moneybag as she moves forward stealthily her right hand ready to shut down on whatever it can grasp no need to label them as long as these vices exist for so long has giotto extracted and presented their visible significance page heading giotto still another exemplification of his sense for the significant is furnished by his treatment of action and movement the grouping the gestures never fail to be just such as will most rapidly convey the meaning so with the significant line the significant light and shade the significant look up or down and the significant gesture with means technically of the simplest and be it remembered with no knowledge of anatomy giotto conveys a complete sense of motion such as we get in his paduan frescoes of the resurrection of the blessed of the ascension of our lord of the god the father in the baptism or the angel in zacharias dream this then is giottos claim to everlasting appreciation as an artist that his thoroughgoing sense for the significant in the visible world enabled him so to represent things that we realise his representations more quickly and more completely than we should realise the things themselves thus giving us that confirmation of our sense of capacity which is so great a source of pleasure iii page heading followers of giotto for a hundred years after giotto there appeared in florence no painter equally endowed with dominion over the significant his immediate followers so little understood the essence of his power that some thought it resided in his massive types others in the swiftness of his line and still others in his light colour and it never occurred to any of them that the massive form without its material significance its tactile values is a shapeless sack that the line which is not functional is mere calligraphy and that light colour by itself can at the best spot a surface prettily the better of them felt their inferiority but knew no remedy and all worked busily copying and distorting giotto until they and the public were heartily tired a change at all costs became necessary and it was very simple when it came why grope about for the significant when the obvious is at hand let me paint the obvious the obvious always pleases said some clever innovator so he painted the obviouspretty clothes pretty faces and trivial action with the results foreseen he pleased then and he pleases still crowds still flock to the spanish chapel in s maria novella to celebrate the triumph of the obvious and nonsignificant pretty faces pretty colour pretty clothes and trivial action is there a single figure in the fresco representing the triumph of st thomas which incarnates the idea it symbolises which without its labelling instrument would convey any meaning whatever one pretty woman holds a globe and sword and i am required to feel the majesty of empire another has painted over her pretty clothes a bow and arrow which are supposed to rouse me to a sense of the terrors of war a third has an organ on what was intended to be her knee and the sight of this instrument must suffice to put me into the ecstasies of heavenly music still another pretty lady has her arm akimbo and if you want to know what edification she can bring you must read her scroll below these pretty women sit a number of men looking as worthy as clothes and beards can make them one highly dignified old gentleman gazes with all his heart and all his soul atthe point of his quill the same lack of significance the same obviousness characterise the fresco representing the church militant and triumphant what more obvious symbol for the church than a church what more significant of st dominic than the refuted paynim philosopher who with a movement by the way as obvious as it is clever tears out a leaf from his own book and i have touched only on the value of these frescoes as allegories not to speak of the emptiness of the one and the confusion of the other as compositions there is not a figure in either which has tactile valuesthat is to say artistic existence while i do not mean to imply that painting between giotto and masaccio existed in vainon the contrary considerable progress was made in the direction of landscape perspective and facial expressionit is true that excepting the works of two men no masterpieces of art were produced these two one coming in the middle of the period we have been dwelling upon and the other just at its close were andrea orcagna and fra angelico page heading orcagna of orcagna it is difficult to speak as only a single fairly intact painting of his remains the altarpiece in s maria novella here he reveals himself as a man of considerable endowment as in giotto we have tactile values material significance the figures artistically exist but while this painting betrays no peculiar feeling for beauty of face and expression the frescoes in the same chapel the one in particular representing paradise have faces full of charm and grace i am tempted to believe that we have here a happy improvement made by the recent restorer but what these mural paintings must always have had is real artistic existence great dignity of slow but rhythmic movement and splendid grouping they still convince us of their high purpose on the other hand we are disappointed in orcagnas sculptured tabernacle at or sammichele where the feeling for both material and spiritual significance is much lower page heading fra angelico we are happily far better situated toward fra angelico enough of whose works have come down to us to reveal not only his quality as an artist but his character as a man perfect certainty of purpose utter devotion to his task a sacramental earnestness in performing it are what the quantity and quality of his work together proclaim it is true that giottos profound feeling for either the materially or the spiritually significant was denied himand there is no possible compensation for the difference but although his sense for the real was weaker it yet extended to fields which giotto had not touched like all the supreme artists giotto had no inclination to concern himself with his attitude toward the significant with his feelings about it the grasping and presentation of it sufficed him in the weaker personality the significant vaguely perceived is converted into emotion is merely felt and not realised over this realm of feeling fra angelico was the first great master gods in his heavenalls right with the world he felt with an intensity which prevented him from perceiving evil anywhere when he was obliged to portray it his imagination failed him and he became a mere child his hells are bogyland his martyrdoms are enacted by children solemnly playing at martyr and executioner and he nearly spoils one of the most impressive scenes ever paintedthe great crucifixion at san marcowith the childish violence of st jeromes tears but upon the picturing of blitheness of ecstatic confidence in gods loving care he lavished all the resources of his art nor were they small to a power of rendering tactile values to a sense for the significant in composition inferior it is true to giottos but superior to the qualifications of any intervening painter fra angelico added the charm of great facial beauty the interest of vivid expression the attraction of delicate colour what in the whole world of art more rejuvenating than angelicos coronation in the uffizithe happiness on all the faces the flowerlike grace of line and colour the childlike simplicity yet unqualifiable beauty of the composition and all this in tactile values which compel us to grant the reality of the scene although in a world where real people are standing sitting and kneeling we know not and care not on what it is true the significance of the event represented is scarcely touched upon but then how well angelico communicates the feeling with which it inspired him yet simple though he was as a person simple and onesided as was his message as a product he was singularly complex he was the typical painter of the transition from medival to renaissance the sources of his feeling are in the middle ages but he enjoys his feelings in a way which is almost modern and almost modern also are his means of expression we are too apt to forget this transitional character of his and ranking him with the moderns we count against him every awkwardness of action and every lack of articulation in his figures yet both in action and in articulation he made great progress upon his precursorsso great that but for masaccio who completely surpassed him we should value him as an innovator moreover he was not only the first italian to paint a landscape that can be identified a view of lake trasimene from cortona but the first to communicate a sense of the pleasantness of nature how readily we feel the freshness and springtime gaiety of his gardens in the frescoes of the annunciation and the noli me tangere at san marco iv page heading masaccio giotto born again starting where death had cut short his advance instantly making his own all that had been gained during his absence and profiting by the new conditions the new demandsimagine such an avatar and you will understand masaccio giotto we know already but what were the new conditions the new demands the medival skies had been torn asunder and a new heaven and a new earth had appeared which the abler spirits were already inhabiting and enjoying here new interests and new values prevailed the thing of sovereign price was the power to subdue and to create of sovereign interest all that helped man to know the world he was living in and his power over it to the artist the change offered a field of the freest activity it is always his business to reveal to an age its ideals but what room was there for sculpture and paintingarts whose first purpose it is to make us realise the material significance of thingsin a period like the middle ages when the human body was denied all intrinsic significance in such an age the figure artist can thrive as giotto did only in spite of it and as an isolated phenomenon in the renaissance on the contrary the figure artist had a demand made on him such as had not been made since the great greek days to reveal to a generation believing in mans power to subdue and to possess the world the physical types best fitted for the task and as this demand was imperative and constant not one but a hundred italian artists arose able each in his own way to meet itin their combined achievement rivalling the art of the greeks in sculpture donatello had already given body to the new ideals when masaccio began his brief career and in the education the awakening of the younger artist the example of the elder must have been of incalculable force but a type gains vastly in significance by being presented in some action along with other individuals of the same type and here donatello was apt rather than to draw his meed of profit to incur loss by descending to the obviouswitness his basreliefs at siena florence and padua masaccio was untouched by this taint types in themselves of the manliest he presents with a sense for the materially significant which makes us realise to the utmost their power and dignity and the spiritual significance thus gained he uses to give the highest import to the event he is portraying this import in turn gives a higher value to the types and thus whether we devote our attention to his types or to his action masaccio keeps us on a high plane of reality and significance in later painting we shall easily find greater science greater craft and greater perfection of detail but greater reality greater significance i venture to say never dustbitten and ruined though his brancacci chapel frescoes now are i never see them without the strongest stimulation of my tactile consciousness i feel that i could touch every figure that it would yield a definite resistance to my touch that i should have to expend thus much effort to displace it that i could walk around it in short i scarcely could realise it more and in real life i should scarcely realise it so well the attention of each of us being too apt to concentrate itself upon some dynamic quality before we have at all begun to realise the full material significance of the person before us then what strength to his young men and what gravity and power to his old how quickly a race like this would possess itself of the earth and brook no rivals but the forces of nature whatever they dosimply because it is theyis impressive and important and every movement every gesture is worldchanging compared with his figures those in the same chapel by his precursor masolino are childish and those by his follower filippino unconvincing and without significance because without tactile values even michelangelo where he comes in rivalry has for both reality and significance to take a second place compare his expulsion from paradise in the sixtine chapel with the one here by masaccio michelangelos figures are more correct but far less tangible and less powerful and while he represents nothing but a man warding off a blow dealt from a sword and a woman cringing with ignoble fear masaccios adam and eve stride away from eden heartbroken with shame and grief hearing perhaps but not seeing the angel hovering high overhead who directs their exiled footsteps masaccio then like giotto a century earlierhimself the giotto of an artistically more propitious worldwas as an artist a great master of the significant and as a painter endowed to the highest degree with a sense of tactile values and with a skill in rendering them in a career of but few years he gave to florentine painting the direction it pursued to the end in many ways he reminds us of the young bellini who knows had he but lived as long he might have laid the foundation for a painting not less delightful and far more profound than that of venice as it was his frescoes at once became and for as long as there were real artists among them remained the trainingschool of florentine painters v masaccios death left florentine painting in the hands of three men older and two somewhat younger than himself all men of great talent if not of genius each of whomthe former to the extent habits already formed would permit the latter overwhelmingly felt his influence the older who but for masaccio would themselves have been the sole determining personalities in their art were fra angelico paolo uccello and andrea del castagno the younger domenico veneziano and fra filippo as these were the men who for a whole generation after masaccios death remained at the head of their craft forming the taste of the public and communicating their habits and aspirations to their pupils we at this point can scarcely do better than try to get some notion of each of them and of the general art tendencies they represented page heading paolo uccello fra angelico we know already as the painter who devoted his life to picturing the departing medival vision of a heaven upon earth nothing could have been farther from the purpose of uccello and castagno different as these two were from each other they have this much in common that in their works which remain to us dating it is true from their years of maturity there is no touch of medival sentiment no note of transition as artists they belonged entirely to the new era and they stand at the beginning of the renaissance as types of two tendencies which were to prevail in florence throughout the whole of the fifteenth century partly supplementing and partly undoing the teaching of masaccio uccello had a sense of tactile values and a feeling for colour but in so far as he used these gifts at all it was to illustrate scientific problems his real passion was perspective and painting was to him a mere occasion for solving some problem in this science and displaying his mastery over its difficulties accordingly he composed pictures in which he contrived to get as many lines as possible leading the eye inward prostrate horses dead or dying cavaliers broken lances ploughed fields noahs arks are used by him with scarcely an attempt at disguise to serve his scheme of mathematically converging lines in his zeal he forgot local colourhe loved to paint his horses green or pinkforgot action forgot composition and it need scarcely be added significance thus in his battlepieces instead of adequate action of any sort we get the feeling of witnessing a show of stuffed figures whose mechanical movements have been suddenly arrested by some clog in their wires in his fresco of the deluge he has so covered his space with demonstrations of his cleverness in perspective and foreshortening that far from bringing home to us the terrors of a cataclysm he at the utmost suggests the bursting of a milldam and in the neighbouring fresco of the sacrifice of noah just as some capitally constructed figures are about to enable us to realise the scene all possibility of artistic pleasure is destroyed by our seeing an object in the air which after some difficulty we decipher as a human being plunging downward from the clouds instead of making this figure which by the way is meant to represent god the father plunge toward us uccello deliberately preferred to make it dash inward away from us thereby displaying his great skill in both perspective and foreshortening but at the same time writing himself down as the founder of two families of painters which have flourished ever since the artists for dexteritys sakemental or manual it scarcely mattersand the naturalists as these two clans increased rapidly in florence and for both good and evil greatly affected the whole subsequent course of florentine painting we must before going farther briefly define to ourselves dexterity and naturalism and their relation to art page heading art for dexteritys sake the essential in painting especially in figurepainting is we agreed the rendering of the tactile values of the forms represented because by this means and this alone can the art make us realise forms better than we do in life the great painter then is above all an artist with a great sense of tactile values and great skill in rendering them now this sense though it will increase as the man is revealed to himself is something which the great painter possesses at the start so that he is scarcely if at all aware of possessing it his conscious effort is given to the means of rendering it is of means of rendering therefore that he talks to others and because his triumphs here are hardearned and conscious it is on his skill in rendering that he prides himself the greater the painter the less likely he is to be aware of aught else in his art than problems of renderingbut all the while he is communicating what the force of his genius makes him feel without his striving for it almost without his being aware of it the material and spiritual significance of forms howeverhis intimates hear him talk of nothing but skill he seems to think of nothing but skill and naturally they and the entire public conclude that his skill is his genius and that skill is art this alas has at all times been the too prevalent notion of what art is divergence of opinion existing not on the principle but on the kind of dexterity to be prized each generation each critic having an individual standard based always on the several peculiar problems and difficulties that interest them at florence these inverted notions about art were especially prevalent because it was a school of art with a score of men of genius and a thousand mediocrities all egging each other on to exhibitions of dexterity and in their hot rivalry it was all the great geniuses could do to be faithful to their sense of significance even masaccio was driven to exhibit his mere skill the much admired and by itself wonderfully realised figure of a naked man trembling with cold being not only without real significance but positively distracting in the representation of a baptism a weaker man like paolo uccello almost entirely sacrificed what sense of artistic significance he may have started with in his eagerness to display his skill and knowledge as for the rabble their work has now the interest of prize exhibitions at local art schools and their number merely helped to accelerate the momentum with which florentine art rushed to its end but out of even mere dexterity a certain benefit to art may come men without feeling for the significant may yet perfect a thousand matters which make rendering easier and quicker for the man who comes with something to render and when botticelli and leonardo and michelangelo appeared they found their artistic patrimony increased in spite of the fact that since masaccio there had been no man at all approaching their genius this increase however was due not at all so much to the sons of dexterity as to the intellectually much nobler but artistically even inferior race of whom also uccello was the ancestorthe naturalists page heading naturalism in art what is a naturalist i venture upon the following definitiona man with a native gift for science who has taken to art his purpose is not to extract the material and spiritual significance of objects thus communicating them to us more rapidly and intensely than we should perceive them ourselves and thereby giving us a sense of heightened vitality his purpose is research and his communication consists of nothing but facts from this perhaps too abstract statement let us take refuge in an example already touched uponthe figure of the almighty in uccellos sacrifice of noah instead of presenting this figure as coming toward us in an attitude and with an expression that will appeal to our sense of solemnity as a man whose chief interest was artistic would have doneas giotto in fact did in his baptismuccello seems to have been possessed with nothing but the scientific intention to find out how a man swooping down headforemost would have looked if at a given instant of his fall he had been suddenly congealed and suspended in space a figure like this may have a mathematical but certainly has no psychological significance uccello it is true has studied every detail of this phenomenon and noted down his observations but because his notes happen to be in form and colour they do not therefore constitute a work of art wherein does his achievement differ in quality from a coloured map of a country we can easily conceive of a relief map of cadore or giverny on so large a scale and so elaborately coloured that it will be an exact reproduction of the physical aspects of those regions but never for a moment should we place it beside a landscape by titian or monet and think of it as a work of art yet its relation to the titian or monet painting is exactly that of uccellos achievement to giottos what the scientist who paintsthe naturalist that is to sayattempts to do is not to give us what art alone can give us the lifeenhancing qualities of objects but a reproduction of them as they are if he succeeded he would give us the exact visual impression of the objects themselves but art as we have already agreed must give us not the mere reproductions of things but a quickened sense of capacity for realising them artistically then the naturalists uccello and his numerous successors accomplished nothing yet their efforts to reproduce objects as they are their studies in anatomy and perspective made it inevitable that when another great genius did arise he should be a leonardo or a michelangelo and not a giotto page heading andrea del castagno uccello as i have said was the first representative of two strong tendencies in florentine paintingof art for dexteritys sake and art for scientific purposes andrea del castagno while also unable to resist the fascination of mere science and dexterity had too much artistic genius to succumb to either he was endowed with great sense for the significant although it is true not enough to save him completely from the pitfalls which beset all florentines and even less from one more peculiar to himselfthe tendency to communicate at any cost a feeling of power to make us feel power as masaccio and michelangelo do at their best is indeed an achievement but it requires the highest genius and the profoundest sense for the significant the moment this sense is at all lacking the artist will not succeed in conveying power but such obvious manifestations of it as mere strength or worse still the insolence not infrequently accompanying high spirits now castagno who succeeds well enough in one or two such single figures as his cuman sibyl or his farinata degli uberti which have great if not the greatest power dignity and even beauty elsewhere condescends to mere swaggeras in his pipo spano or niccolo di tolentinoor to mere strength as in his last supper or worse still to actual brutality as in his santa maria nuova crucifixion nevertheless his few remaining works lead us to suspect in him the greatest artist and the most influential personality among the painters of the first generation after masaccio vi page heading domenico veneziano to distinguish clearly after the lapse of nearly five centuries between uccello and castagno and to determine the precise share each had in the formation of the florentine school is already a task fraught with difficulties the scantiness of his remaining works makes it more than difficult makes it almost impossible to come to accurate conclusions regarding the character and influence of their somewhat younger contemporary domenico veneziano that he was an innovator in technique in affairs of vehicle and medium we know from vasari but as such innovations indispensable though they may become to painting as a craft are in themselves questions of theoretic and applied chemistry and not of art they do not here concern us his artistic achievements seem to have consisted in giving to the figure movement and expression and to the face individuality in his existing works we find no trace of sacrifice made to dexterity and naturalism although it is clear that he must have been master of whatever science and whatever craft were prevalent in his day otherwise he would not have been able to render a figure like the st francis in his uffizi altarpiece where tactile values and movement expressive of characterwhat we usually call individual gaitwere perhaps for the first time combined or to attain to such triumphs as his st john and st francis at santa croce whose entire figures express as much fervour as their eloquent faces as to his sense for the significant in the individual in other words his power as a portraitpainter we have in the pitti one or two heads to witness perhaps the first great achievements in this kind of the renaissance page heading fra filippo lippi no such difficulties as we have encountered in the study of uccello castagno and veneziano meet us as we turn to fra filippo his works are still copious and many of them are admirably preserved we therefore have every facility for judging him as an artist yet nothing is harder than to appreciate him at his due if attractiveness and attractiveness of the best kind sufficed to make a great artist then filippo would be one of the greatest greater perhaps than any other florentine before leonardo where shall we find faces more winsome more appealing than in certain of his madonnasthe one in the uffizi for instancemore momentarily evocative of noble feeling than in his louvre altarpiece where in florentine painting is there anything more fascinating than the playfulness of his children more poetic than one or two of his landscapes more charming than is at times his colour and with all this health even robustness and almost unfailing goodhumour yet by themselves all these qualities constitute only a highclass illustrator and such by native endowment i believe fra filippo to have been that he became morevery much moreis due rather to masaccios potent influence than to his own genius for he had no profound sense of either material or spiritual significancethe essential qualifications of the real artist working under the inspiration of masaccio he at times renders tactile values admirably as in the uffizi madonnabut most frequently he betrays no genuine feeling for them failing in his attempt to render them by the introduction of bunchy billowy calligraphic draperies these acquired from the late giottesque painter probably lorenzo monaco who had been his first master he seems to have prized as artistic elements no less than the tactile values which he attempted to adopt later serenely unconscious apparently of their incompatibility filippos strongest impulse was not toward the preeminently artistic one of recreation but rather toward expression and within that field toward the expression of the pleasant genial spiritually comfortable feelings of ordinary life his real place is with the genre painters only his genre was of the soul as that of othersof benozzo gozzoli for examplewas of the body hence a sin of his own scarcely less pernicious than that of the naturalists and cloying to bootexpression at any cost vii page heading naturalism in florentine art from the brief account just given of the four dominant personalities in florentine painting from about 1430 to about 1460 it results that the leanings of the school during this interval were not artistic and artistic alone but that there were other tendencies as well tendencies on the one side toward the expression of emotion scarcely less literary because in form and colour than if in words and on the other toward the naturalistic reproduction of objects we have also noted that while the former tendency was represented by filippo alone the latter had paolo uccello and all of castagno and veneziano that the genius of these two men would permit them to sacrifice to naturalism and science to the extent however that they took sides and were conscious of a distinct purpose these also sided with uccello and not with filippo it may be agreed therefore that the main current of florentine painting for a generation after masaccio was naturalistic and that consequently the impact given to the younger painters who during this period were starting was mainly toward naturalism later in studying botticelli we shall see how difficult it was for any one young at the time to escape this tide even if by temperament farthest removed from scientific interests meanwhile we must continue our study of the naturalists but now of the second generation their number and importance from 1460 to 1490 is not alone due to the fact that art education toward the beginning of this epoch was mainly naturalistic but also to the real needs of a rapidly advancing craft and even more to the character of the florentine mind the dominant turn of which was to science and not to art but as there were then no professions scientific in the stricter sense of the word and as art of some form was the pursuit of a considerable proportion of the male inhabitants of florence it happened inevitably that many a lad with the natural capacities of a galileo was in early boyhood apprenticed as an artist and as he never acquired ordinary methods of scientific expression and never had time for occupations not breadwinning he was obliged his life long to make of his art both the subject of his strong instinctive interest in science and the vehicle of conveying his knowledge to others page heading alessio baldovinetti this was literally the case with the oldest among the leaders of the new generation alessio baldovinetti in whose scanty remaining works no trace of purely artistic feeling or interest can be discerned and it is only less true of alessios somewhat younger but far more gifted contemporaries antonio pollaiuolo and andrea verrocchio these also we should scarcely suspect of being more than men of science if pollaiuolo once or twice and verrocchio more frequently did not dazzle us with works of almost supreme art which but for our readiness to believe in the manifold possibilities of florentine genius we should with exceeding difficulty accept as their creationso little do they seem to result from their conscious striving alessios attention being largely devoted to problems of vehicleto the side of painting which is scarcely superior to cookeryhe had time for little else although that spare time he gave to the study of landscape in the rendering of which he was among the innovators andrea and antonio set themselves the much worthier task of increasing on every side the effectiveness of the figure arts of which sculpture no less than painting they aimed to be masters page heading pollaiuolo and verrocchio to confine ourselves however as closely as we may to painting and leaving aside for the present the question of colour which as i have already said is in florentine art of entirely subordinate importance there were three directions in which painting as pollaiuolo and verrocchio found it had greatly to advance before it could attain its maximum of effectiveness landscape movement and the nude giotto had attempted none of these the nude of course he scarcely touched movement he suggested admirably but never rendered and in landscape he was satisfied with indications hardly more than symbolical although quite adequate to his purpose which was to confine himself to the human figure in all directions masaccio made immense progress guided by his never failing sense for material significance which as it led him to render the tactile values of each figure separately compelled him also to render the tactile values of groups as wholes and of their landscape surroundingsby preference hills so shaped as readily to stimulate the tactile imagination for what he accomplished in the nude and in movement we have his expulsion and his man trembling with cold to witness but in his works neither landscape nor movement nor the nude are as yet distinct sources of artistic pleasurethat is to say in themselves lifeenhancing although we can well leave the nude until we come to michelangelo who was the first to completely realise its distinctly artistic possibilities we cannot so well dispense with an enquiry into the sources of our sthetic pleasure in the representation of movement and of landscape as it was in these two directionsin movement by pollaiuolo especially and in landscape by baldovinetti pollaiuolo and verrocchiothat the great advances of this generation of florentine painters were made viii page heading representation of movement turning our attention first to movementwhich by the way is not the same as motion mere change of placewe find that we realise it just as we realise objects by the stimulation of our tactile imagination only that here touch retires to a second place before the muscular feelings of varying pressure and strain i see to take an example two men wrestling but unless my retinal impressions are immediately translated into images of strain and pressure in my muscles of resistance to my weight of touch all over my body it means nothing to me in terms of vivid experiencenot more perhaps than if i heard some one say two men are wrestling although a wrestling match may in fact contain many genuinely artistic elements our enjoyment of it can never be quite artistic we are prevented from completely realising it not only by our dramatic interest in the game but also granting the possibility of being devoid of dramatic interest by the succession of movements being too rapid for us to realise each completely and too fatiguing even if realisable now if a way could be found of conveying to us the realisation of movement without the confusion and the fatigue of the actuality we should be getting out of the wrestlers more than they themselves can give usthe heightening of vitality which comes to us whenever we keenly realise life such as the actuality itself would give us plus the greater effectiveness of the heightening brought about by the clearer intenser and less fatiguing realisation this is precisely what the artist who succeeds in representing movement achieves making us realise it as we never can actually he gives us a heightened sense of capacity and whatever is in the actuality enjoyable he allows us to enjoy at our leisure in words already familiar to us he extracts the significance of movements just as in rendering tactile values the artist extracts the corporeal significance of objects his task is however far more difficult although less indispensableit is not enough that he should extract the values of what at any given moment is an actuality as is an object but what at no moment really isnamely movement he can accomplish his task in only one way and that is by so rendering the one particular movement that we shall be able to realise all other movements that the same figure may make he is grappling with his enemy now i say of my wrestler what a pleasure to be able to realise in my own muscles on my own chest with my own arms and legs the life that is in him as he is making his supreme effort what a pleasure as i look away from the representation to realise in the same manner how after the contest his muscles will relax and rest trickle like a refreshing stream through his nerves all this i shall be made to enjoy by the artist who in representing any one movement can give me the logical sequence of visible strain and pressure in the parts and muscles it is just here that the scientific spirit of the florentine naturalists was of immense service to art this logic of sequence is to be attained only by great although not necessarily more than empiric knowledge of anatomy such perhaps as the artist pure would never be inclined to work out for himself but just such as would be of absorbing interest to those scientists by temperament and artists by profession whom we have in pollaiuolo and to a less extent in verrocchio we remember how giotto contrived to render tactile values of all the possible outlines of all the possible variations of light and shade that a figure may have he selected those that we must isolate for special attention when we are actually realising it if instead of figure we say figure in movement the same statement applies to the way pollaiuolo rendered movementwith this difference however that he had to render what in actuality we never can perfectly isolate the line and light and shade most significant of any given action this the artist must construct himself out of his dramatic feeling for pressure and strain and his ability to articulate the figure in all its logical sequences for if he would convey a sense of movement he must give the line and the light and shade which will best render not tactile values alone but the sequences of articulations page heading battle of the nudes it would be difficult to find more effective illustration of all that has just been said about movement than one or two of pollaiuolos own works which in contrast to most of his achievements where little more than effort and research are visible are really masterpieces of lifecommunicating art let us look first at his engraving known as the battle of the nudes what is it that makes us return to this sheet with ever renewed ever increased pleasure surely it is not the hideous faces of most of the figures and their scarcely less hideous bodies nor is it the pattern as decorative design which is of great beauty indeed but not at all in proportion to the spell exerted upon us least of all is itfor most of usan interest in the technique or history of engraving no the pleasure we take in these savagely battling forms arises from their power to directly communicate life to immensely heighten our sense of vitality look at the combatant prostrate on the ground and his assailant bending over each intent on stabbing the other see how the prostrate man plants his foot on the thigh of his enemy and note the tremendous energy he exerts to keep off the foe who turning as upon a pivot with his grip on the others head exerts no less force to keep the advantage gained the significance of all these muscular strains and pressures is so rendered that we cannot help realising them we imagine ourselves imitating all the movements and exerting the force required for themand all without the least effort on our side if all this without moving a muscle what should we feel if we too had exerted ourselves and thus while under the spell of this illusionthis hypersthesia not bought with drugs and not paid for with cheques drawn on our vitalitywe feel as if the elixir of life not our own sluggish blood were coursing through our veins page heading hercules strangling david let us look now at an even greater triumph of movement than the nudes pollaiuolos hercules strangling antus as you realise the suction of hercules grip on the earth the swelling of his calves with the pressure that falls on them the violent throwing back of his chest the stifling force of his embrace as you realise the supreme effort of antus with one hand crushing down upon the head and the other tearing at the arm of hercules you feel as if a fountain of energy had sprung up under your feet and were playing through your veins i cannot refrain from mentioning still another masterpiece this time not only of movement but of tactile values and personal beauty as wellpollaiuolos david at berlin the young warrior has sped his stone cut off the giants head and now he strides over it his graceful slender figure still vibrating with the rapidity of his triumph expectant as if fearing the ease of it what lightness what buoyancy we feel as we realise the movement of this wonderful youth ix page heading verrocchio and landscape in all that concerns movement verrocchio was a learner from pollaiuolo rather than an initiator and he probably never attained his masters proficiency we have unfortunately but few terms for comparison as the only paintings which can be with certainty ascribed to verrocchio are not pictures of action a drawing however like that of his angel in the british museum which attempts as much movement as the hercules by pollaiuolo in the same collection is of obviously inferior quality yet in sculpture along with works which are valuable as harbingers of leonardo rather than for any intrinsic perfection he created two such masterpieces of movement as the child with the dolphin in the courtyard of the palazzo vecchio and the colleoni monument at venicethe latter sinning if at all by an overexuberance of movement by a step and swing too suggestive of drums and trumpets but in landscape verrocchio was a decided innovator to understand what new elements he introduced we must at this point carry out our determination to enquire into the source of our pleasure in landscape painting or ratherto avoid a subject of vast extent for which this is not the placeof landscape painting as practised by the florentines page heading landscape painting before verrocchio his precursors first alessio baldovinetti and then pollaiuolo had attempted to treat landscape as naturalistically as painting would permit their ideal was to note it down with absolute correctness from a given point of view their subject almost invariably the valdarno their achievement a birdseye view of this tuscan paradise nor can it be denied that this gives pleasure but the pleasure is only such as is conveyed by tactile values instead of having the difficulty we should have in nature to distinguish clearly points near the horizons edge we here see them perfectly and without an effort and in consequence feel great confirmation of capacity for life now if landscape were as most people vaguely believe a pleasure coming through the eyes alone then the pollaiuolesque treatment could be equalled by none that has followed and surpassed only by rogier van der weyden or by the quaint german master of the lyversberg passion who makes us see objects miles away with as great a precision and with as much intensity of local colour as if we were standing off from them a few feet were landscape really this then nothing more inartistic than gradation of tint atmosphere and plein air all of which help to make distant objects less clear and therefore tend in no way to heighten our sense of capacity but as a matter of fact the pleasure we take in actual landscape is only to a limited extent an affair of the eye and to a great extent one of unusually intense wellbeing the painters problem therefore is not merely to render the tactile values of the visible objects but to convey more rapidly and unfailingly than nature would do the consciousness of an unusually intense degree of wellbeing this taskthe communication by means purely visual of feelings occasioned chiefly by sensations nonvisualis of such difficulty that until recently successes in the rendering of what is peculiar to landscape as an art and to landscape alone were accidental and sporadic only now in our own days may painting be said to be grappling with this problem seriously and perhaps we are already at the dawn of an art which will have to what has hitherto been called landscape the relation of our music to the music of the greeks or of the middle ages page heading verrocchios landscapes verrocchio was among florentines at least the first to feel that a faithful reproduction of the contours is not landscape that the painting of nature is an art distinct from the painting of the figure he scarcely knew where the difference lay but felt that light and atmosphere play an entirely different part in each and that in landscape these have at least as much importance as tactile values a vision of plein air vague i must grant seems to have hovered before him and feeling his powerlessness to cope with it in full effects of light such as he attempted in his earlier pictures he deliberately chose the twilight hour when in tuscany on fine days the trees stand out almost black against a sky of light opalescent grey to render this subduing soothing effect of the coolness and the dew after the glare and dust of the daythe effect so matchlessly given in grays elegyseemed to be his first desire as a painter and in presence of his annunciation in the uffizi we feel that he succeeded as only one other tuscan succeeded after him that other being his own pupil leonardo x page heading genre artists it is a temptation to hasten on from pollaiuolo and verrocchio to botticelli and leonardo to men of genius as artists reappearing again after two generations men who accomplished with scarcely an effort what their precursors had been toiling after but from these it would be even more difficult than at present to turn back to painters of scarcely any rank among the worlds great artists and of scarcely any importance as links in a chain of evolution but not to be passed by partly because of certain qualities they do possess and partly because their names would be missed in an account even so brief as this of florentine painting the men i chiefly refer to one most active toward the middle and the other toward the end of the fifteenth century are benozzo gozzoli and domenico ghirlandaio although they have been rarely coupled together they have much in common both were as artists little more than mediocrities with almost no genuine feeling for what makes painting a great art the real attractiveness of both lies entirely outside the sphere of pure art in the realms of genre illustration and here the likeness between them ends within their common ground they differed widely page heading benozzo gozzoli benozzo was gifted with a rare facility not only of execution but of invention with a spontaneity a freshness a liveliness in telling a story that wake the child in us and the lover of the fairy tale later in life his more precious gifts deserted him but who wants to resist the fascination of his early works painted as they seem by a fra angelico who had forgotten heaven and become enamoured of the earth and the springtime in his riccardi palace frescoes he has sunk already to portraying the florentine apprentices dream of a holiday in the country on st johns day but what a naf ideal of luxury and splendour it is with these the glamour in which he saw the world began to fade away from him and in his pisan frescoes we have it is true many a quaint bit of genre superior to teniers only because of superior associations but never again the fairy tale and as the better recedes it is replaced by the worse by the bane of all genre painting nonsignificant detail and positive bad taste have london or new york or berlin worse to show us than the jumble of buildings in his ideal of a great city his picture of babylon it may be said he here continues medival tradition which is quite true but this very fact indicates his real place which in spite of his adopting so many of the fifteenthcentury improvements is not with the artists of the renaissance but with the storytellers and costumed fairytale painters of the transition with spinello aretino and gentile da fabriano for instance and yet once in a while he renders a head with such character or a movement with such ease that we wonder whether he had not in him after all the making of a real artist page heading ghirlandaio ghirlandaio was born to far more science and cunning in painting than was current in benozzos early years and all that industry all that love of his occupation all that talent even can do for a man they did for him but unfortunately he had not a spark of genius he appreciated masaccios tactile values pollaiuolos movement verrocchios effects of light and succeeded in so sugaring down what he adopted from these great masters that the superior philistine of florence could say there now is a man who knows as much as any of the great men but can give me something that i can really enjoy bright colour pretty faces good likenesses and the obvious everywhereattractive and delightful it must be granted but except in certain single figures never significant let us glance a moment at his famous frescoes in santa maria novella to begin with they are so undecorative that in spite of the tone and surface imparted to them by four centuries they still suggest so many tableaux vivants pushed into the wall side by side and in tiers then the compositions are as overfilled as the sheets of an illustrated newspaperwitness the massacre of the innocents a scene of such magnificent artistic possibilities finally irrelevant episodes and irrelevant groups of portraits do what they can to distract our attention from all higher significance look at the birth of john ginevra dei benci stands there in the very foreground staring out at you as stiff as if she had a photographers iron behind her head an even larger group of florentine housewives in all their finery disfigures the birth of the virgin which is further spoiled by a bas relief to show off the painters acquaintance with the antique and by the figure of the serving maid who pours out water with the rush of a whirlwind in her skirtsthis to show off skill in the rendering of movement yet elsewhere as in his epiphany in the uffizi ghirlandaio has undeniable charm and occasionally in portraits his talent here at its highest rises above mediocrity in one instance the fresco of sassetti in santa trinit becoming almost genius xi page heading leonardo all that giotto and masaccio had attained in the rendering of tactile values all that fra angelico or filippo had achieved in expression all that pollaiuolo had accomplished in movement or verrocchio in light and shade leonardo without the faintest trace of that tentativeness that painfulness of effort which characterised his immediate precursors equalled or surpassed outside velasquez and perhaps when at their best rembrandt and degas we shall seek in vain for tactile values so stimulating and so convincing as those of his mona lisa outside degas we shall not find such supreme mastery over the art of movement as in the unfinished epiphany in the uffizi and if leonardo has been left far behind as a painter of light no one has succeeded in conveying by means of light and shade a more penetrating feeling of mystery and awe than he in his virgin of the rocks add to all this a feeling for beauty and significance that have scarcely ever been approached where again youth so poignantly attractive manhood so potently virile old age so dignified and possessed of the worlds secrets who like leonardo has depicted the mothers happiness in her child and the childs joy in being alive who like leonardo has portrayed the timidity the newness to experience the delicacy and refinement of maidenhood or the enchantress intuitions the inexhaustible fascination of the woman in her years of mastery look at his many sketches for madonnas look at his profile drawing of isabella deste or at the belle joconde and see whether elsewhere you find their equals leonardo is the one artist of whom it may be said with perfect literalness nothing that he touched but turned into a thing of eternal beauty whether it be the crosssection of a skull the structure of a weed or a study of muscles he with his feeling for line and for light and shade forever transmuted it into lifecommunicating values and all without intention for most of these magical sketches were dashed off to illustrate purely scientific matter which alone absorbed his mind at the moment and just as his art is lifecommunicating as is that of scarcely another so the contemplation of his personality is lifeenhancing as that of scarcely any other man think that great though he was as a painter he was no less renowned as a sculptor and architect musician and improviser and that all artistic occupations whatsoever were in his career but moments snatched from the pursuit of theoretical and practical knowledge it would seem as if there were scarcely a field of modern science but he either foresaw it in vision or clearly anticipated it scarcely a realm of fruitful speculation of which he was not a freeman and as if there were hardly a form of human energy which he did not manifest and all that he demanded of life was the chance to be useful surely such a man brings us the gladdest of all tidingsthe wonderful possibilities of the human family of whose chances we all partake painting then was to leonardo so little of a preoccupation that we must regard it as merely a mode of expression used at moments by a man of universal genius who recurred to it only when he had no more absorbing occupation and only when it could express what nothing else could the highest spiritual through the highest material significance and great though his mastery over his craft his feeling for significance was so much greater that it caused him to linger long over his pictures labouring to render the significance he felt but which his hand could not reproduce so that he rarely finished them we thus have lost in quantity but have we lost in quality could a mere painter or even a mere artist have seen and felt as leonardo we may well doubt we are too apt to regard a universal genius as a number of ordinary brains somehow conjoined in one skull and not always on the most neighbourly terms we forget that genius means mental energy and that a leonardo for the selfsame reason that prevents his being merely a painterthe fact that it does not exhaust a hundredth part of his energywill when he does turn to painting bring to bear a power of seeing feeling and rendering as utterly above that of the ordinary painter as the mona lisa is above let us say andrea del sartos portrait of his wife no let us not join in the reproaches made to leonardo for having painted so little because he had much more to do than to paint he has left all of us heirs to one or two of the supremest works of art ever created xii page heading botticelli never pretty scarcely ever charming or even attractive rarely correct in drawing and seldom satisfactory in colour in types illfavoured in feeling acutely intense and even dolorouswhat is it then that makes sandro botticelli so irresistible that nowadays we may have no alternative but to worship or abhor him the secret is this that in european painting there has never again been an artist so indifferent to representation and so intent upon presentation educated in a period of triumphant naturalism he plunged at first into mere representation with almost selfobliterating earnestness the pupil of fra filippo he was trained to a love of spiritual genre himself gifted with strong instincts for the significant he was able to create such a type of the thinker as in his fresco of st augustin yet in his best years he left everything even spiritual significance behind him and abandoned himself to the presentation of those qualities alone which in a picture are directly lifecommunicating and lifeenhancing those of us who care for nothing in the work of art but what it represents are either powerfully attracted or repelled by his unhackneyed types and quivering feeling but if we are such as have an imagination of touch and of movement that it is easy to stimulate we feel a pleasure in botticelli that few if any other artists can give us long after we have exhausted both the intensest sympathies and the most violent antipathies with which the representative elements in his pictures may have inspired us we are only on the verge of fully appreciating his real genius this in its happiest moments is an unparalleled power of perfectly combining values of touch with values of movement look for instance at botticellis venus rising from the sea throughout the tactile imagination is roused to a keen activity by itself almost as life heightening as music but the power of music is even surpassed where as in the goddess manelike tresses of hair fluttering to the wind not in disorderly rout but in masses yielding only after resistance the movement is directly lifecommunicating the entire picture presents us with the quintessence of all that is pleasurable to our imagination of touch and of movement how we revel in the force and freshness of the wind in the life of the wave and such an appeal he always makes his subject may be fanciful as in the realm of venus the spring religious as in the sixtine chapel frescoes or in the coronation of the virgin political as in the recently discovered pallas taming a centaur or even crudely allegorical as in the louvre frescoesno matter how unpropitious how abstract the idea the vivid appeal to our tactile sense the lifecommunicating movement is always there indeed at times it seems that the less artistic the theme the more artistic the fulfilment the painter being impelled to give the utmost values of touch and movement to just those figures which are liable to be read off as mere empty symbols thus on the figure representing political disorderthe centaurin the pallas botticelli has lavished his most intimate gifts he constructs the torso and flanks in such a way that every line every indentation every boss appeals so vividly to the sense of touch that our fingers feel as if they had everywhere been in contact with his body while his face gives to a still heightened degree this convincing sense of reality every line functioning perfectly for the osseous structure of brow nose and cheeks as to the hairimagine shapes having the supreme life of line you may see in the contours of licking flames and yet possessed of all the plasticity of something which caresses the hand that models it to its own desire page heading lineal decoration in fact the mere subject and even representation in general was so indifferent to botticelli that he appears almost as if haunted by the idea of communicating the unembodied values of touch and movement now there is a way of rendering even tactile values with almost no body and that is by translating them as faithfully as may be into values of movement for instancewe want to render the roundness of a wrist without the slightest touch of either light or shade we simply give the movement of the wrists outline and the movement of the drapery as it falls over it and the roundness is communicated to us almost entirely in terms of movement but let us go one step further take this line that renders the roundness of the wrist or a more obvious example the lines that render the movements of the tossing hair the fluttering draperies and the dancing waves in the birth of venustake these lines alone with all their power of stimulating our imagination of movement and what do we have pure values of movement abstracted unconnected with any representation whatever this kind of line then being the quintessence of movement has like the essential elements in all the arts a power of stimulating our imagination and of directly communicating life well imagine an art made up entirely of these quintessences of movementvalues and you will have something that holds the same relation to representation that music holds to speechand this art exists and is called lineal decoration in this art of arts sandro botticelli may have had rivals in japan and elsewhere in the east but in europe never to its demands he was ready to sacrifice everything that habits acquired under filippo and pollaiuoloand his employerswould permit the representative element was for him a mere libretto he was happiest when his subject lent itself to translation into what may be called a lineal symphony and to this symphony everything was made to yield tactile values were translated into values of movement and for the same reasonto prevent the drawing of the eye inward to permit it to devote itself to the rhythm of the linethe backgrounds were either entirely suppressed or kept as simple as possible colour also with almost a contempt for its representative function botticelli entirely subordinated to his lineal scheme compelling it to draw attention to the line rather than as is usual away from it this is the explanation of the value put upon botticellis masterpieces in some of his later works such as the dresden predelle we have it is true bacchanals rather than symphonies of line and in many of his earlier paintings in the fortezza for instance the harness and trappings have so disguised pegasus that we scarcely know him from a cart horse but the painter of the venus rising from the sea of the spring or of the villa lemmi frescoes is the greatest artist of lineal design that europe has ever had xiii page heading popularisers of art leonardo and botticelli like michelangelo after them found imitators but not successors to communicate more material and spiritual significance than leonardo would have taken an artist with deeper feeling for significance to get more music out of design than botticelli would have required a painter with even greater passion for the reembodiment of the pure essences of touch and movement there were none such in florence and the followers of botticellileonardos were all milanese and do not here concern uscould but imitate the patterns of their master the patterns of the face the patterns of the composition and the patterns of the line dragging them down to their own level sugaring them down to their own palate slowing them down to their own insensitiveness for what is lifecommunicating and although their productions which were nothing but translations of great mans art into average mans art became popular as was inevitable with the average man of their time who comprehended them better and felt more comfortable in their presence than in that of the originals which he respectfully admired but did not so thoroughly enjoy nevertheless we need not dwell on these popularisers nor on their popularisationsnot even on filippino with his touch of consumptive delicacy nor raffaelino del garbo with his glints of nevertobefulfilled promise page heading fra bartolommeo before approaching the one man of genius left in florence after botticelli and leonardo before speaking of michelangelo the man in whom all that was most peculiar and much that was greatest in the striving of florentine art found its fulfilment let us turn for a moment to a few painters who just because they were men of manifold talent might elsewhere almost have become masters fra bartolommeo andrea del sarto pontormo and bronzino were perhaps no less gifted as artists than palma bonifazio veronese lotto and tintoretto but their talents instead of being permitted to flower naturally were scorched by the passion for showing off dexterity blighted by academic ideals and uprooted by the whirlwind force of michelangelo fra bartolommeo who in temperament was delicate refined graceful and as a painter had a miniaturists feeling for the dainty was induced to desert his lovely women his exquisite landscape and his gentleness of expression for figures constructed mechanically on a colossal scale or for effects of the round at any cost and as evil is more obvious than good bartolommeo the painter of that masterpiece of colour and light and shade of graceful movement and charming feeling the madonna with the baptist and st stephen in the cathedral at lucca bartolommeo the dainty deviser of mr monds tiny nativity bartolommeo the artificer of a hundred masterpieces of pen drawing is almost unknown and to most people fra bartolommeo is a sort of synonym for pomposity he is known only as the author of physically colossal spiritually insignificant prophets and apostles or perchance as the painter of pitchdark altarpieces this being the reward of devices to obtain mere relief page heading andrea del sarto andrea del sarto approached perhaps as closely to a giorgione or a titian as could a florentine ill at ease in the neighbourhood of leonardo and michelangelo as an artist he was it is true not endowed with the profoundest sense for the significant yet within the sphere of common humanity who has produced anything more genial than his portrait of a ladyprobably his wifewith a petrarch in her hands where out of venetia can we find portraits so simple so frank and yet so interpretive as his sculptor or as his various portraits of himselfthese by the way an autobiography as complete as any in existence and tragic as few almost venetian again is his st james caressing children a work of the sweetest feeling even in colour effect and technique how singularly close to the best venetian painting in his dispute about the trinitywhat blacks and whites what greys and purplish browns and in addition tactile values peculiar to florencewhat a back st sebastians but in a work of scarcely less technical merit the madonna of the harpies we already feel the man not striving to get the utmost out of himself but panting for the grand and magnificent even here he remains almost a great artist because his natural robustness comes to his rescue but the madonna is too obviously statuesque and good saints pray why all these draperies the obviously statuesque and draperies were andreas devices for keeping his head above water in the rising tide of the michelangelesque as you glance in sequence at the annunziata frescoes on the whole so full of vivacity gaiety and genuine delight in life you see from one fresco to another the increased attention given to draperies in the scalzo series otherwise masterpieces of tactile values the draperies do their utmost to smother the figures most of these paintings are closed in with ponderous forms which have no other purpose than to serve as a frame and as clotheshorses for draperies witness the scene of zacharias in the temple wherein none of the bystanders dare move for fear of disturbing their too obviously arranged folds thus by constantly sacrificing first spiritual and then material significance to pose and draperies andrea loses all feeling for the essential in art what a sad spectacle is his assumption wherein the apostles the virgin herself have nothing better to do than to show off draperies instead of feeling as in the presence of titians assunta wrapt to heaven you gaze at a number of tailors men each showing how a stuff you are thinking of trying looks on the back or in a certain effect of light but let us not end on this note let us bear in mind that despite all his faults andrea painted the one last supper which can be looked at with pleasure after leonardos page heading pontormo pontormo who had it in him to be a decorator and portraitpainter of the highest rank was led astray by his awestruck admiration for michelangelo and ended as an academic constructor of monstrous nudes what he could do when expressing himself we see in the lunette at poggio a caiano as design as colour as fancy the freshest gayest most appropriate mural decoration now remaining in italy what he could do as a portraitpainter we see in his wonderfully decorative panel of cosimo dei medici at san marco or in his portrait of a lady with a dog at frankfort perhaps the first portrait ever painted in which the sitters social position was insisted upon as much as the personal character what pontormo sank to we see in such a riot of meaningless nudes all caricatures of michelangelo as his martyrdom of forty saints page heading bronzino bronzino pontormos close follower had none of his masters talent as a decorator but happily much of his power as a portraitpainter would he had never attempted anything else the nude without material or spiritual significance with no beauty of design or colour the nude simply because it was the nude was bronzinos ideal in composition and the result is his christ in limbo but as a portraitpainter he took up the note struck by his master and continued it leaving behind him a series of portraits which not only had their effect in determining the character of court painting all over europe but what is more to the point a series of portraits most of which are works of art as painting it is true they are hard and often timid but their air of distinction their interpretive qualities have not often been surpassed in his uffizi portraits of eleanora di toledo of prince ferdinand of the princess maria we seem to see the prototypes of velasquez queens princes and princesses and for a fine example of dignified rendering of character look in the sala baroccio of the uffizi at a bust of a young woman with a missal in her hand xiv page heading michelangelo the great florentine artists as we have seen were with scarcely an exception bent upon rendering the material significance of visible things this little though they may have formulated it was the conscious aim of most of them and in proportion as they emancipated themselves from ecclesiastical dominion and found among their employers men capable of understanding them their aim became more and more conscious and their striving more energetic at last appeared the man who was the pupil of nobody the heir of everybody who felt profoundly and powerfully what to his precursors had been vague instinct who saw and expressed the meaning of it all the seed that produced him had already flowered into a giotto and once again into a masaccio in him the last of his race born in conditions artistically most propitious all the energies remaining in his stock were concentrated and in him florentine art had its logical culmination page heading anthropomorphism in art michelangelo had a sense for the materially significant as great as giottos or masaccios but he possessed means of rendering inherited from donatello pollaiuolo verrocchio and leonardomeans that had been undreamt of by giotto or even by masaccio add to this that he saw clearly what before him had been felt only dimly that there was no other such instrument for conveying material significance as the human nude this fact is as closely dependent on the general conditions of realising objects as tactile values are on the psychology of sight we realise objects when we perfectly translate them into terms of our own states our own feelings so obviously true is this that even the least poetically inclined among us because we keenly realise the movement of a railway train to take one example out of millions speak of it as going or running instead of rolling on its wheels thus being no less guilty of anthropomorphising than the most unregenerate savages of this same fallacy we are guilty every time we think of anything whatsoever with the least warmthwe are lending this thing some human attributes the more we endow it with human attributes the less we merely know it the more we realise it the more does it approach the work of art now there is one and only one object in the visible universe which we need not anthropomorphise to realiseand that is man himself his movements his actions are the only things we realise without any mythmaking effortdirectly hence there is no visible object of such artistic possibilities as the human body nothing with which we are so familiar nothing therefore in which we so rapidly perceive changes nothing then which if represented so as to be realised more quickly and vividly than in life will produce its effect with such velocity and power and so strongly confirm our sense of capacity for living page heading value of the nude in art values of touch and movement we remember are the specifically artistic qualities in figure painting at least as practised by the florentines for it is through them chiefly that painting directly heightens life now while it remains true that tactile values can as giotto and masaccio have forever established be admirably rendered on the draped figure yet drapery is a hindrance and at the best only a way out of a difficulty for we feel it masking the really significant which is the form underneath a mere painter one who is satisfied to reproduce what everybody sees and to paint for the fun of painting will scarcely comprehend this feeling his only significant is the obviousin a figure the face and the clothing as in most of the portraits manufactured nowadays the artist even when compelled to paint draped figures will force the drapery to render the nude in other words the material significance of the human body but how much more clearly will this significance shine out how much more convincingly will the character manifest itself when between its perfect rendering and the artist nothing intervenes and this perfect rendering is to be accomplished with the nude only if draperies are a hindrance to the conveyance of tactile values they make the perfect rendering of movement next to impossible to realise the play of muscle everywhere to get the full sense of the various pressures and resistances to receive the direct inspiration of the energy expended we must have the nude for here alone can we watch those tautnesses of muscle and those stretchings and relaxings and ripplings of skin which translated into similar strains on our own persons make us fully realise movement here alone the translation owing to the multitude and the clearness of the appeals made is instantaneous and the consequent sense of increased capacity almost as great as can be attained while in the draped figure we miss all the appeal of visible muscle and skin and realise movement only after a slow translation of certain functional outlines so that the sense of capacity which we receive from the perception of movement is increased but slightly we are now able to understand why every art whose chief preoccupation is the human figure must have the nude for its chief interest why also the nude is the most absorbing problem of classic art at all times not only is it the best vehicle for all that in art which is directly lifeconfirming and lifeenhancing but it is itself the most significant object in the human world the first person since the great days of greek sculpture to comprehend fully the identity of the nude with great figure art was michelangelo before him it had been studied for scientific purposesas an aid in rendering the draped figure he saw that it was an end in itself and the final purpose of his art for him the nude and art were synonymous here lies the secret of his successes and his failures page heading michelangelo first his successes nowhere outside of the best greek art shall we find as in michelangelos works forms whose tactile values so increase our sense of capacity whose movements are so directly communicated and inspiring other artists have had quite as much feeling for tactile values alonemasaccio for instance others still have had at least as much sense of movement and power of rendering itleonardo for example but no other artist of modern times having at all his control over the materially significant has employed it as michelangelo did on the one subject where its full value can be manifestedthe nude hence of all the achievements of modern art his are the most invigorating surely not often is our imagination of touch roused as by his adam in the creation by his eve in the temptation or by his many nudes in the same ceiling of the sixtine chapelthere for no other purpose be it noted than their direct tonic effect nor is it less rare to quaff such draughts of unadulterated energy as we receive from the god creating adam the boy angel standing by isaiah orto choose one or two instances from his drawings in their own kind the greatest in existencethe gods shooting at a mark or the hercules and the lion and to this feeling for the materially significant and all this power of conveying it to all this more narrowly artistic capacity michelangelo joined an ideal of beauty and force a vision of a glorious but possible humanity which again has never had its like in modern times manliness robustness effectiveness the fulfilment of our dream of a great soul inhabiting a beautiful body we shall encounter nowhere else so frequently as among the figures in the sixtine chapel michelangelo completed what masaccio had begun the creation of the type of man best fitted to subdue and control the earth and who knows perhaps more than the earth page heading last works of michelangelo but unfortunately though born and nurtured in a world where his feeling for the nude and his ideal of humanity could be appreciated he passed most of his life in the midst of tragic disasters and while yet in the fulness of his vigour in the midst of his most creative years he found himself alone perhaps the greatest but alas also the last of the giants born so plentifully during the fifteenth century he lived on in a world he could not but despise in a world which really could no more employ him than it could understand him he was not allowed therefore to busy himself where he felt most drawn by his genius and much against his own strongest impulses he was obliged to expend his energy upon such subjects as the last judgment his later works all show signs of the altered conditions first in an overflow into the figures he was creating of the scorn and bitterness he was feeling then in the lack of harmony between his genius and what he was compelled to execute his passion was the nude his ideal power but what outlet for such a passion what expression for such an ideal could there be in subjects like the last judgment or the crucifixion of petersubjects which the christian world imperatively demanded should incarnate the fear of the humble and the selfsacrifice of the patient now humility and patience were feelings as unknown to michelangelo as to dante before him or for that matter to any other of the worlds creative geniuses at any time even had he felt them he had no means of expressing them for his nudes could convey a sense of power not of weakness of terror not of dread of despair but not of submission and terror the giant nudes of the last judgment do feel but it is not terror of the judge who being in no wise different from the others in spite of his omnipotent gesture seems to be announcing rather than willing what the bystanders his fellows could not unwill as the representation of the moment before the universe disappears in chaosgods huddling together for the gtterdmmerungthe last judgment is as grandly conceived as possible but when the crash comes none will survive it no not even god michelangelo therefore failed in his conception of the subject and could not but fail but where else in the whole world of art shall we receive such blasts of energy as from this giants dream or if you will nightmare for kindred reasons the crucifixion of peter is a failure art can be only lifecommunicating and lifeenhancing if it treats of pain and death these must always appear as manifestations and as results only of living resolutely and energetically what chance is there i ask for this artistically the only possible treatment in the representation of a man crucified with his head downwards michelangelo could do nothing but make the bystanders the executioners all the more lifecommunicating and therefore inevitably more sympathetic no wonder he failed here what a tragedy by the way that the one subject perfectly cut out for his genius the one subject which required none but genuinely artistic treatment his bathers executed forty years before these last works has disappeared leaving but scant traces yet even these suffice to enable the competent student to recognise that this composition must have been the greatest masterpiece in figure art of modern times that michelangelo had faults of his own is undeniable as he got older and his genius lacking its proper outlets tended to stagnate and thicken he fell into exaggerationsexaggerations of power into brutality of tactile values into feats of modelling no doubt he was also at times as indifferent to representation as botticelli but while there is such a thing as movement there is no such thing as tactile values without representation yet he seems to have dreamt of presenting nothing but tactile values hence his many drawings with only the torso adequately treated the rest unheeded still another result from his passion for tactile values i have already suggested that giottos types were so massive because such figures most easily convey values of touch michelangelo tended to similar exaggerations to making shoulders for instance too broad and too bossy simply because they make thus a more powerful appeal to the tactile imagination indeed i venture to go even farther and suggest that his faults in all the arts sculpture no less than painting and architecture no less than sculpture are due to this selfsame predilection for salient projections but the lover of the figure arts for what in them is genuinely artistic and not merely ethical will in michelangelo even at his worst get such pleasures as excepting a few others even at their best rarely give him page heading constant aims of florentine art in closing let us note what results clearly even from this brief account of the florentine school namely that although no florentine merely took up and continued a predecessors work nevertheless all from first to last fought for the same cause there is no opposition between giotto and michelangelo the best energies of the first of the last and of all the intervening great florentine artists were persistently devoted to the rendering of tactile values or of movement or of both now successful grappling with problems of form and of movement is at the bottom of all the higher arts and because of this fact florentine painting despite its many faults is after greek sculpture the most serious figure art in existence index to the works of the principal florentine painters note the following lists make no claim to absolute completeness but no genuine work by the painters mentioned found in the better known public or private collections has been omitted with the exception of three or four pictures which he knows only in the photographs the author has seen and carefully studied every picture indicated and is alone responsible for the attributions although he is happy to acknowledge his indebtedness to the writings of signor cavalcaselle of the late giovanni morelli of signor gustavo frizzoni and of dr j p richter for the convenience of students lists of the sculptures but the more important only have been appended to the lists of pictures by those artists who have left sculptures as well as paintings public galleries are mentioned first then private collections and churches last the principal public gallery is always understood after the simple mention of a city or town thus paris means paris louvre london means london national gallery etc an interrogation point after the title of a picture indicates that its attribution to the given painter is doubtful distinctly early or late works are marked e or l it need scarcely be said that the attributions here given are not based on
