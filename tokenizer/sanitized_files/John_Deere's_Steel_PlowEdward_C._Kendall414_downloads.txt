andrus 17 the first plow 19 steel or iron 21 why a steel plow 23 reconstructions 24 in summary 25 by edward c kendall john deeres steel plow john deere in 1837 invented a plow that could be used successfully in the sticky rootfilled soil of the prairie it was called a steel plow actually it appears that only the cutting edge the share on the first deere plows was steel the moldboard was smoothly ground wrought iron deeres invention succeeded because as the durable steel share of the plow cut through the heavy earth the sticky soil could find no place to cling on its polished surfaces americans moving westward in the beginning of the 19th century soon encountered the prairie lands of what we now call the middle west the dark fertile soils promised great rewards to the farmers settling in these regions but also posed certain problems first was the breaking of the tough prairie sod the naturalist john muir describes the conditions facing prairie farmers when he was a boy in the early 1850s as he tells of the use of the big prairiebreaking plows in the following words1 they were used only for the first ploughing in breaking up the wild sod woven into a tough mass chiefly by the cordlike roots of perennial grasses reinforced by the tap roots of oak and hickory bushes called grubs some of which were more than a century old and four or five inches in diameter if in good trim the plough cut through and turned over these grubs as if the centuryold wood were soft like the flesh of carrots and turnips but if not in good trim the grubs promptly tossed the plough out of the ground the second and greater problem was that the richer lands of the prairie bottoms after a few years of continuous cultivation became so sticky that they clogged the moldboards of the plows clogging was such a factor in prairie plowing that farmers in these regions carried a wooden paddle solely for cleaning off the moldboard a task which had to be repeated so frequently that it seriously interfered with plowing efficiency it seems probable that by the 1830s blacksmiths in the prairie country were beginning to solve the problem of continuous cultivation of sticky prairie soil by nailing strips of saw steel to the face of wooden moldboard of the traditional plows figure 1 is a photograph of an 18th century new england plow in the collection of the u s national museum this is one type of plow which was brought west by the settlers it contributed to the development of the prairie breaker shown in figure 2 the first plow on record with strips of steel on the moldboard is attributed to john lane in chicago in 18332 steel presented a smoother surface which shed the sticky loam better than the conventional wooden moldboards covered with wrought iron or the cast iron moldboards of the newer factorymade plows then coming into use it is generally accepted as historical fact that john deere made his first steel plow in 1837 at grand detour illinois the details of the construction of this plow have been variously given by different writers ardrey3 and davidson4 describe deeres original plow as having a wooden moldboard covered with strips of steel cut from a saw in the manner of the john lane plow sidebar the author edward c kendall is curator of agriculture museum of history and technology in the smithsonian institutions united states national museum in recent years the 1837 deere plow has been pictured quite differently this has apparently come about as the result of the discovery of an old plow identified as one made by john deere at grand detour in 1838 and sold to joseph brierton from whose farm it was obtained in 1901 by the makers son charles h deere he brought it to the office of deere company at moline illinois for preservation and display this plow is shown in figures 7 and 9 in 1938 deere company presented it to the u s national museum where it is on display it can be seen that the moldboard is made of one curved diamondshaped metal slab this plow bottom conforms to the description of the diamond plows manufactured by deere in the 1840s5 the company states that according to its records this was one of three plows made by deere in 1838 and that it was probably substantially identical with the first one made in 18376 it may be difficult to prove that the museums specimen was made in 1838 but a comparison of this plow fig 7 with the 1847 moldboard fig 5 and the 1855 plow fig 6 suggests that the museums plow is the earliest of the three since there is particularly evident an evolution of the shape of the moldboard from a simple almost crude form to a more sophisticated shape illustration figure 1new england strong plow mid18th century colter locked into heavy broad share wooden moldboard covered with iron strips cat no f1091 smithsonian photo 13214 deere and andrus writers of the 20th century describing the making of the first john deere steel plow have in mind the 1838 plow one7 has john deere pondering the local plowing problem and getting an idea from the polished surface of a broken steel mill saw another8 claims that leonard andrus the founder and leading figure of grand detour and part owner of the sawmill conceived the design of the plow and employed deere the blacksmith newly arrived from vermont to build it this idea may have originated with and was certainly promoted by the late fred a wirt as advertising manager of the j i case company it is difficult at this distance to determine the parts played at the beginning by deere and andrus illustration figure 2large prairiebreaking plow mid19th century wheels underneath the beam regulate the depth of plowing large wheel runs in the furrow small wheel on the land the colter is braced at the bottom as well as at the top the share cuts a broad shallow strip of sod which the long gently curving moldboard turns over unbroken the earliest existing partnership agreement involving andrus and deere is dated march 20 18439 the existing copy is unsigned but its conditions are the same as those in the agreements executed during the next few years it began by stating that deere and andrus had agreed to become copartners together in the art and trade of blacksmithing ploughmaking and all things thereto belonging at the said grand detour and all other business that the said parties may hereafter deem necessary for their mutual interest and benefit one of the terms was that the copartnership should continue from the date of the agreement under the name and firm of leonard andrus a second agreement dated october 26 184410 which brought in a third partner horace paine described the business as the art and trade of blacksmithing plough making iron castings and all things thereto belonging and stated that the copartnership should be conducted under the name and firm of l andrus and co the third agreement dated october 20 1846 in which another man appeared in place of paine gave the name of the firm as andrus deere and lathrop11 this carried an addendum dated june 22 1847 in which andrus and deere bought out lathrops interest in the business and agreed to continue under the name of andrus and deere this is the only mention of the firm of andrus and deere it could only have lasted a few months because it was in 1847 that deere moved to moline and established his plow factory there illustration figure 3reconstructions of john deeres 1837 plow for a discussion of the position and attachment of the handles see p 24 deere company photo these agreements suggest that leonard andrus was the capitalist of the young community of grand detour as well as its founder the dominance of the name andrus tends to back up the opinion which holds that andrus was the leading figure in the development of the successful prairie plow on the other hand the general tone of the agreements suggests that two or more people were participating in an enterprise in which each contributed to the business and shared in the results deere contributed his plow and his blacksmith shop tools and outbuildings andrus contributed money and business experience there is no indication that they were formally associated prior to the agreement of march 20 1843 an advertisement it is quoted later dated february 3 1843 and appearing in the march 10 1843 issue of the rock river register carries an announcement by john deere that he is ready to fill orders for plows which he then describes there is no mention of andrus or of an andrus and deere firm i am inclined by the evidence to the view that deere worked out his plow by himself began to manufacture it in small numbers needed money to enlarge and expand his operations and went to the logical source of capital in the community leonard andrus in support of this view i quote a statement by mr burton f peek12 who has spent most of his life in deere company and who may now be the only person living who knew john deere andrus removed to grand de tour from some place in new york rochester though originally from vermont some years later john deere came along from rutland vermont leaving his family behind him whether deere ever heard of andrus or andrus of deere no one knows having decided to remain in grand de tour deere sent for his family asking my paternal grandfather william peek to bring them and also the peek family out to grand de tour this was done via covered wagon the journey occupying some six weeks my father henry c peek was then an infant age six weeks and charles deere the son of john an infant of about the same age of course these infants came along sleeping in the feed box of the wagon my grandfather took up land adjacent to grand de tour and john deere continued in the manufacturing business incidentally john deere and william peek were brothersinlaw having married sisters and what i have said and much more that i might say to you is based upon what i have been told by my grandfather by john deere and by others who had a part in the early history of the company so far as i know i am the only living person who ever knew or saw john deere i joined the deere company on october 1 1888 at the age of 16 and retired on the 28th of april 1956nearly 68 years c h deere was my great friend and benefactor i was educated at his expense as a lawyer and practiced for thirteen years during this time i was his personal attorney i drew his will was made trustee thereunder and probably was more intimate with him than any living person i have seen and read the manuscript of an early history of the company which he wrote but never published and there was nothing in it to indicate that andrus had any part in the manufacture of the first successful steel plow and it is my firm belief that he had no part other than perhaps a friendly interest in it the first plow most writers describe deere cutting a diamondshaped piece out of a broken steel mill saw there is usually no further identification of the type of saw beyond the statement that it came from the andrus sawmill neil clark author of a brief biography of john deere states that the diamondshaped piece was cut out of a circular saw13 there is no evidence given to support this there are some powerful arguments against it the circular saw especially of the larger size was probably not very common in america in the 1830s although an english patent for a circular saw was issued in 1777 the first circular saw in america is attributed to benjamin cummins of bentonsville new york about 181414 illustration figure 4how deere probably cut and bent the flat plate of his 1838 plow to form the moldboard and landside because of the shape of the moldboard it became known as the diamond plow illustration figure 5moldboard of 1847 john deere plow showing how the diamond shape of the original design has been slightly modified deere company photo 57192d in a small new pioneering community it seems unlikely that the local sawmill would have been equipped with the newer circular saw rather than the familiar up and down saw which remained in use throughout the 19th century and in places well into the 20th century the up and down saw was a broad strip of iron or steel with large teeth in one edge driven by water power it slowly cut large logs into boards it is doubtful that the circular saws of that period were large enough for this kind of mill work the second argument is the shape of the moldboard itself the photograph of the 1838 plow in figure 7 shows that the shape of the moldboard is unconventional it is essentially a parallelogram curved to present a concave surface to the furrow slice and thus to make a simple small but workable plow a parallelogram or diamond would be an easy shape to cut out of a mill saw with the teeth removed the moldboard on the 1838 plow is from 228 to 238 inches thick and its width is 12 inches these dimensions approximate those given in an 1897 disston catalog15 which describes mulay saws a type of mill saw from 10 to 12 inches wide and from 4 to 9 gauge gauge number 4 is the thickest and is 238 inches examination of the 1838 plow suggests that deere cut the moldboard and landside as one piece which was then heated and bent to the desired form the pattern of this piece is shown in figure 4 some additional metal appears to be forged into the sharp bend at the junction of the moldboard and the landside apparently to strengthen this part which may have begun to open during the bending if however deere had used a large circular saw with plenty of room for cutting out a moldboard of the usual shape and size it seems likely that he would have made a plow of more conventional appearance in any event his moldboard of one jointless piece of polished metal would scour better than one of wood covered with strips of steel since the nailheads and the joints between the strips would provide places for the earth to stick illustration figure 6the shape of the moldboard continued to evolve as illustrated by this 1855 john deere plow deere company photo 57192a a very great majority of writers describing john deere and his plow attribute his fame to his development of a successful steel plow which made cultivation of rich prairie soil practical the emphasis is always on the development of a steel moldboard and the assumption is that from the 1837 plow onward stretched an unbroken line of steel moldboard plows an advertisement for john deere plows in the march 10 1843 issue of the rock river register published weekly in grand detour illinois gives a detailed description here presented in full john deere respectfully informs his friends and customers the agricultural community of this and adjoining counties and dealers in ploughs that he is now prepared to fill orders for the same on presentation the moldboard of this well and so favorably known plough is made of wrought iron and the share of steel 516 of an inch thick which carries a fine sharp edge the whole face of the moldboard and share is ground smooth so that it scours perfectly bright in any soil and will not choke in the foulest of ground it will do more work in a day and do it much better and with less labor to both team and holder than the ordinary ploughs that do not scour and in consequence of the ground being better prepared the agriculturalist obtains a much heavier crop the price of ploughs in consequence of hard times will be reduced from last years prices grand detour feb 3 1843 this raised two questions why and for how long was wrought iron used for the moldboards of the deere plows of what material is the moldboard of the 1838 plow made during the first few years when production was very small there were probably enough worn out mill saws available for the relatively few plows made as production increased this source must have become inadequate ardrey gives the following figures for the production of plows by deere and andrus16 1839 10 plows 1840 40 plows 1841 75 plows 1842 100 plows 1843 400 plows ardrey states further that by this time the difficulty of obtaining steel in the quantity and quality needed had become a serious obstacle in the way of further development the statement quoted above that the moldboard was of wrought iron and the statistics on production of plows during the 1840s and 1850s belie ardreys claim that it was a serious obstacle nor is there any suggestion in the advertisement that wrought iron was being substituted for steel in 1847 john deere amicably severed relations with the firm of andrus deere and moved to moline illinois to continue plow manufacturing in a site that had better transportation facilities than grand detour the new firm produced 700 plows in the first year 1600 in 1850 and 10000 in 185717 swank18 states that the first slab of cast plow steel ever rolled in the united states was in 1846 and that it was shipped to john deere of moline illinois a little later he says that it was not until the early 1860s in this country that several firms succeeded in making high grade crucible cast steel of uniform quality as a regular product illustration figure 7john deeres 1838 plow right side showing large iron staple used to fasten end of right handle to the standard note remains of wooden pin near rear end of plow beam cat no f1111 smithsonian photo 42639a based on a visit to deeres factory in 1857 the country gentleman19 gave the yearly output as 13400 plows it pictured four of seven models and stated these are all made of cast steel and perfectly polished before they are sent out and are kept bright by use so that no soil adheres to them the article then gives the tonnages of iron and steel used by the deere factory in a year they are as follows 50 tons cast steel 40 tons german steel 100 tons pittsburgh steel 75 tons castings 200 tons wrought iron 8 tons malleable castings in clevises etc in addition 100000 plow bolts and 200000 feet of oak plank were used these figures do not indicate what the different parts of the plows were made of but if approximately correct they do show that more than half the metal used was iron rather than steel steel accounts for 190 tons wrought iron for 200 although it is conceivable under this weight distribution that the shares and moldboards were made of steel while the landsides and standards were made of wrought iron other distributions are also possible and it is quite conceivable that at this period some of the plows had steel moldboards while others had wroughtiron ones an analysis of the metal in different parts of an 1855 john deere plow now at the factory in moline may shed some light on this but from these figures and dates it seems likely that most of john deeres plows during the 1840s and 1850s had wroughtiron moldboards with steel shares it should be borne in mind that the poorer grades of steel available at this time were probably no more satisfactory than cast iron as far as scouring clean in sticky soil was concerned illustration figure 8reconstruction of deeres 1838 plow right side with handles shown in what is believed to be their original position smithsonian photo 42647 the question of the material in the moldboard of the 1838 plow was answered when a sparktest analysis was made of the metal in the moldboard and share in this test the color shape and pattern of the spark bursts produced by a highspeed grinding wheel indicate the type of iron or steel several spots along the edges and back surface of the moldboard were tested no carbon bursts were seen in the spark patterns indicating that the material was wrought iron the share consists of a piece wedge shaped in cross section welded on to the lower or front edge of the moldboard this was tested at several spots along its sharp edge all of which gave a pattern and color indicating that the material was medium high carbon steel this test was corroborated by a chemical analysis of filings from the moldboard and share in a metallurgical laboratory a small trace of carbon was found in the moldboard it may be present as the result of contamination from several sources a likely one being the charcoal fire in the forge when it was heated for bending and shaping20 these tests agree perfectly with the description in the 1843 advertisement it seems therefore that deeres success in making plows that worked well in prairie bottom lands depended as much on the smooth surface he produced by grinding and polishing as on the material used the filing of the edge of the moldboard for the metallurgical test disclosed that the wroughtiron slab consisted of five thin laminations apparently forged together but with separations visible the length and regularity of the lines of separation seem to preclude their being striations resulting from the fibrous structure of wrought iron this calls into question the theory that the moldboard and landside were cut from a mill saw since it hardly seems likely that a saw would be made of laminated material the possibility exists that the body of the mill saw might have been made this way with a toothbearing steel edge welded on but there seems little reason for making a saw out of thin laminations it is also possible that this laminated iron originally had been intended for some other purpose such as boiler plate and may have been available in rectangular pieces in making the 1838 plow deere followed a pattern fig 4 which suggests that he cut it out of such a piece illustration figure 9john deeres 1838 plow left side showing details of construction and relationship of landside to moldboard cat no f1111 smithsonian photo 42639 since the moldboard of the 1838 plow is of wrought iron and since this plow is thought to be essentially identical with the first one deere made in 1837 it is highly probable that the 1837 plow also had a wroughtiron moldboard a condition which appears to have been the basic pattern for john deere plows until the middle 1850s why a steel plow in view of the facts and the probabilities based on them how is the legend of the john deere steel plow to be explained there are several likely reasons it is possible that the first plow in 1837 was made from a broken steel mill saw it is also possible that within a few years puddled iron came to be used for the moldboards because of the scarcity of suitable steel either in the form of broken mill saws or as plates ordered from foundries in america the high price of steel imported from england made this an impractical source however it seems more likely that it became known as a steel plow owing to the importance deere attached to his plows having steel shares as shown in his advertisement in 1843 a steel share tougher than cast iron would hold an edge much better than wrought iron and john muirs description of prairie plowing quoted earlier substantiates the importance of a tough sharp share deeres plows probably distinctive by reason of their steel shares may have been called steel plows in the regions where they were used to distinguish them from the standard wooden plows and from the newer castiron implements the term wooden plow has a similar history for well over 2000 years in europe some plows have been made with iron shares and the rest of the structure wood plows in 18thcentury america were made principally of wood with iron shares colters and clevises and with strips of iron frequently covering the wooden moldboard these implements were called simply plows of various regional types not until the development and spread of the factorymade plows with castiron moldboards landsides and standards did the term wooden plow come into use to differentiate all these plows from the newer ones subsequently writers have been led to assume that wooden plow meant a plow with no iron parts and consequently to make unwarranted statements about the primitiveness of the 18thcentury implements a second reason for use of the term steel plow may have developed from the supposition that the moldboards of the first john deere plows were made of diamondshaped sections cut from old mill saws which later writers seem to have assumed were made of steel it is probable that from the late 1850s on deere plows had steel moldboards however mill saws of the early 19th century were not necessarily made of steel which was then relatively expensive i have been told of an old mill saw made of wrought iron on which was welded a steel edge that carried the teeth21 rees cyclopaedia22 describes saws as being made of either wrought iron or steel the latter being preferable therefore it seems most likely that deeres plows from his first until the middle 1850s were made with highly polished wroughtiron moldboards and steel shares reconstructions the remains of the 1838 plow are shown in figures 7 and 9 ones curiosity is aroused as to what the plow looked like in its original state complete with handles several fullscale 3dimensional reconstructions and a number of sketches of the 1837 plow have been made the reconstructions all must have been based on the remains of the 1838 plow since they resemble it closely and it is the only surviving plow of this type known recently i received a photograph fig 3 right of a plow which has been boxed and in storage for many years at deere company which may be an early deere plow as it appears in the photograph the plow looks unconvincing the handles are fastened by bolts and nuts a manner uncommon in american plow making in the early 19th century the shape of the handles is that of stock handles available for small plows and cultivators in such a catalog as belknaps the plow seems very high and weakly braced there is no logical reason for curving the end of the beam down and cutting it off at a slant if the handles are attached in the manner shown the edges of the tenon on the upper end of the standard where it goes through the mortise in the beam have been neatly beveled in a manner i have never seen before on any other plow all of this leads me to think that this is an early reconstruction based on the remains of the 1838 plow which it only roughly approximates in proportion and design another of these reconstructions is shown in figure 3 left although superficially like the 1838 plow it varies considerably in its proportions in the angular relations of its parts and in other details such as the use of iron bolts and nuts in place of wooden pins all these reconstructions agree in one thing they show a plow with handles fastened to both sides of the plow beam and standard during an examination of the 1838 plow it occurred to me that there was no indication of an attachment of a handle on the landside in the same manner as on the furrow side the position and attachment of the handle in figure 7 is clearly indicated by the remains of a wooden pin in the side of the plow beam near the rear end and by the large iron staple in the side of the standard which must have held the tapered lower end of the handle figure 8 is a sketch showing this handle in position the landside view of this plow in figure 9 shows that the pin did not extend through the beam nor are there marks on the standard to indicate the position of a staple like that on the furrow side the four holes approximately in line on the standard and beam show where a piece of sheet metal had been nailed to hold the beam and standard in about the right position the outline of the sheet metal can be seen on the side of the beam this was removed at the time this examination was made how was the landside handle attached w e bridges of the national museum suggests that it might have been attached to the lower side of the standard and the rear end of the plow beam this seems beyond doubt to be correct the wood has deteriorated considerably over the years and the joints are loose but within the limits of the existing structure the plow beam can easily be set in such a position that its sloping rear end lines up with the slope of the underside of the standard furthermore a long bolt runs from the upper part of the moldboard through the standard and projects quite far beyond its lower surface as can be seen in figure 7 the end of the bolt is threaded only part way and it has been necessary to put a cylindrical metal spacer on it in order to draw up the nut snugly this long bolt must originally have passed through the lower end of the handle which in turn was fastened to the end of the plow beam by a tenon on the end of the beam now broken off passing through a mortise in the handle this was the common method of fastening the handle to the beam the square hole in the plows iron landside fig 7 which at first might seem meant for another bolt passing through the lower end of the handle at right angles to the long bolt seems too close to the other bolt and to the edges of the handle it may simply be a first try for the bolt through the bottom of the standard in this manner the handle would have been strongly attached to the plow frame and at the same time would have materially helped to make it rigid by forming one side of a triangular structure figures 8 and 10 show what i believe to be the correct reconstruction of the 1838 deere plow along the lines just described and therefore the probable appearance of the 1837 plow illustration figure 10reconstruction of deeres 1838 plow left side showing how left handle is believed to have been attached smithsonian photo 42637 it should also be noted that it was general practice in making fixed moldboard plows to have the plow beam standard handle and landside or sharebeam on the old plows in the same plane symmetrical handles branching from both sides of the beam are found on cultivators shovel plows middle busters and sidehill plows where the moldboard is turned alternately to each side in summary the existing evidence i believe indicates that 1 the successful prairie plow with a smooth onepiece moldboard and steel share was basically deeres idea 2 the moldboards of practically all of his plows from 1837 and for about 15 years were made of wrought iron rather than steel 3 the success of his plows in the prairie soils depended on a steel share which held a sharp edge and a highly polished moldboard to which the sticky soils could not cling 4 the importance attached to the steel share led to the plows being identified as steel plows 5 the correct reconstruction of the 1838 plow and by inference the 1837 plow is shown in figures 8 and 10 previous reconstructions being wrong primarily in the position and attachment of the handles 6 the museums john deere plow cat no f1111 shown in figures 7 and 9 is a very early specimen on the basis of a comparison of it with deere moldboards of 1847 and 1855 and its conformity to deeres description of his plows in an 1843 advertisement and the 1838 date associated with it is plausible footnotes 1 john muir 18381914 the story of my boyhood and
