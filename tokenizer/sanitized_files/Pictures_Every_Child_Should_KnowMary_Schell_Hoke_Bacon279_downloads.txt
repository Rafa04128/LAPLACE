acknowledgments to the many authoritative writers upon artists and pictures here quoted thanks are due to such excellent compilers of books on art subjects as sadakichi hartmann muther c h caffin ida prentice whitcomb russell sturgis and others introduction mans inclination to decorate his belongings has always been one of the earliest signs of civilisation art had its beginning in the lines indented in clay perhaps or hollowed in the wood of family utensils after that came crude colouring and drawing among the first serious efforts to draw were the egyptian square and pointed things animals and men the most that artists of that day succeeded in doing was to preserve the fashions of the time their drawings tell us that men wore their beards in bags they show us also many peculiar headdresses and strange agricultural implements artists of that day put down what they saw and they saw with an untrained eye and made the record with an untrained hand but they did not put in false details for the sake of glorifying the subject one can distinguish a man from a mountain in their work but the arms and legs embroidered upon mathildes tapestry or the figures representing family history on an oriental rug are quite as correct in drawing and as little of a puzzle as men became more intelligent hence spiritualised they began to express themselves in ideal ways to glorify the commonplace and thus they passed from egyptian geometry to gracious lines and beautiful colouring indian pottery was the first development of art in america and it led to the working of metals followed by drawing and portraiture among the americans as soon as that term ceased to mean indians art took a most distracting turn europe was old in pictures great and beautiful when america was worshipping at the shrine of the chromo but the chromo served a good turn bad as it was it was a link between the black and white of the admirable woodcut and the true colour picture some of the colonists brought over here the portraits of their ancestors but those paintings could not be considered american art nor were those early settlers americans but the generation that followed gave to the world benjamin west he left his mother country for england where he found a knighthood and honours of every kind awaiting him the earliest artists of america had to go away to do their work because there was no place here for any men but those engaged in clearing land planting corn and fighting indians sir benjamin west was president of the royal academy while america was still revelling in chromos the artists who remained chose such objects as davy crockett in the trackless forest or made pictures of the continental congress after the chromo in america came the picture known as the buckeye painted by relays of artists great canvases were stretched and blocked off into lengths the scene was drawn in by one man who was followed by artists each in turn painting sky water foliage figures according to his specialty thus whole yards of canvas could be painted in a day with more artists to the square inch than are now employed to paint advertisements on a barn the centennial exhibition of 1876 came as a glorious flashlight for the first time real art was seen by a large part of our nation every farmer took home with him a new idea of the possibilities of drawing and colour the change that instantly followed could have occurred in no other country than the united states because no other people would have travelled from the four points of the compass to see such an exhibition thus it was the americans penchant for travel which first opened to him the art world for he was conscious even then of the educational advantages to be found somewhere although there seemed to be few of them in the united states after the centennial arose a taste for the painting of plaques upon which were the heads of ladies with strangecoloured hair of leathercovered flatirons bearing flowers of unnatural colour or of shovels decorated with snow scenes the whole nation began to revel in art it was a low variety yet it started toward a goal which left the chromo at the rear end of the course and it was a better effort than the mottoes worked in worsted which had till then been the chief decoration in most homes if the buckeye was handpainting this was singlehand painting and it did not take a generation to bring the change about only a season after the philadelphia exhibition the daughter of the household painted a little just as she played the piano a little today much less than a mans lifetime since then there is in america a universal love for refined art and a fair technical appreciation of pictures while already the nation has worthily contributed to the world of artists sir benjamin west sully and sargent are ours inness inman and trumbull the curator of the metropolitan museum in new york has declared that portraitpainting must be the means which shall save the modern artists from their sins to quote him an artist may paint a bright green cow if he is so minded the cow has no redress the cow must suffer and be silent but human beings who sit for portraits seem to lean toward portraits in which they can recognise their own features when they have commissioned an artist to paint them a man will insist upon even the most brilliant artist painting him in trousers for instance instead of in petticoats however the artistwhim may direct otherwise and a woman is likely to insist that the artist who paints her portrait shall maintain some recognised shade of brown or blue or gray when he paints her eye instead of indulging in a burnt orange or maybe pink these personal preferences certainly put a limit to an artists genius and keep him from writing himself down a madman thus in portraitpainting with the exactions of truth upon it lies the hope of artlovers it is the same authority who calls attention to the danger that lies in extremes either in finding no value in art outside the old masters or in admiring pictures so impressionistic that the objects in them need to be labelled before they can be recognised the true artlover has a catholic taste is interested in all forms of art but he finds beauty where it truly exists and does not allow the nightmare of imagination to mislead him that which is not beautiful from one point of view or another is not art but decadence that which is technical to the exclusion of other elements remains technique pure and simple workmanshipthe bare bones of art a thing is not art simply because it is fantastic it may be interesting as showing to what degree some imaginations can become diseased but it is not pleasing nor is it art there are fully a thousand pictures that every child should know since he can hardly know too much of a good thing but there is room in this volume only to acquaint him with fortyeight and possibly inspire him with the wish to look up the

italian painters received their names in peculiar ways this mans father was a tailor and the artist was named after his fathers profession he was in fact the tailors andrea and his fathers name was angelo one story of this brilliant painter which reads from first to last like a romance has been told by the poet browning who dresses up fact so as to smother it a little but there is truth at the bottom andrea married a wife whom he loved tenderly she had a beautiful face that seemed full of spirituality and feeling and andrea painted it over and over again the artist loved his work and dreamed always of the great things that he should do but he was so much in love with his wife that he was dependent on her smile for all that he did which was well done and her frown plunged him into despair andreas wife cared nothing for his genius painting did not interest her and she had no worthy ambition for her husband but she loved fine clothes and good living and so encouraged him enough to keep him earning these things for her as soon as some money was made she would persuade him to work no more till it was spent and even when he had made agreements to paint certain pictures for which he was paid in advance she would torment him till he gave all of his time to her whims neglected his duty and spent the money for which he had rendered no service thus in time he became actually dishonest as we shall see it is a sad sort of story to tell of so brilliant a young man andrea was born in the gualfonda quarter of florence and there is some record of his ancestors for a hundred years before that although their lives were quite unimportant andrea was one of four children and as usual with italians of artistic temperament he was set to work under the eye of a goldsmith this craftsmanship of a fine order was as near to art as a man could get with any certainty of making his living it was a time when the italian world bedecked itself with rare golden trinkets wreaths for womens hair girdles brooches and the like and the finest skill was needed to satisfy the taste thus it required talent of no mean order for a man to become a successful goldsmith andrea did not like the work and instead of fashioning ornaments from his masters models he made original drawings which did not do at all in a shop where an apprentice was expected to earn his salt certain fashions had to be followed and people did not welcome fantastic or new designs because of this andrea was early put out of his masters shop and set to learn the only business that he could be got to learn painting this meant for him a very different teacher from the goldsmith the artist may be said to have been his own master because even when he was apprenticed to a painter he was taught less than he already knew that first teacher was barile a coarse and unpleasing man as well as an incapable one but he was fair minded after a fashion and put andrea into the way of finding better help after a few years under the direction of piero di cosimo andrea and a friend francia bigio decided to set up shop for themselves the two devoted friends pitched their tent in the piazza del grano and made a meagre beginning out of which great things were to grow they began a series of pictures which was to lead at least one of them to fame it was in the little piazza del grano studio that the baptism of christ was painted a partnership work that had been planned in the campagnia dello scalzo the baptism was not much of a picture as great pictures go but it was a beginning and it was looked at and talked about which was something at a time when titian and leonardo had set the standard of great work in the piazza del grano andrea and his friend lived in the stables of the tuscan grand dukes with a host of other fine artists and they had gay times together andrea was a shy youth a little timid and by no means vain of his own work but he painted with surprising swiftness and sureness and had a very brilliant imagination its was his main trouble that he had more imagination than true manhood he sacrificed everything good to his imagination after the partnership with his friend he undertook to paint some frescoes independently and that work earned for him the name of andrea senza erroriandrea the unerring then as now each artist had his own way of working and andreas was perhaps the most difficult of all yet the most geniuslike there were those michael angelo for example who laid in backgrounds for their paintings but andrea painted his subject upon the wet plaster precisely as he meant it to be when finished he was unlike the moody michael angelo unlike the gentle raphael unlike the fastidious van dyck who came long afterward he was hailfellowwellmet among his associates though often given over to dreaminess he belonged to a jolly club named the kettle club literally the company of the kettle and to another called the trowel both suggesting an all around good time and much good fellowship the members of these clubs were expected to contribute to their wonderful suppers and andrea on one occasion made a great temple in imitation of the baptistry of jelly with columns of sausages white birds and pigeons represented the choir and priests besides being andrew the unerring and a merry andrew he was also the tailors andrew a man in short upon whom a nickname sat comfortably he helped to make the history of the company of the kettle for he recited and probably composed a touching ballad called the battle of the mice and the frogs which doubtless had its origin in a poem of homers but all at once in the midst of his gay careless life came his tragedy he fell in love with a hatters wife this was quite bad enough but worse was to come for the hatter shortly died and the widow was free to marry andrea after his marriage andrea began painting a series of madonnas seemingly for no better purpose than to exhibit his wifes beauty over and over again he lost his ambition and forgot everything but his love for this unworthy woman she was entirely commonplace incapable of inspiring true genius or honesty of purpose a great art critic vasari who was andreas pupil during this time has written that the wife lucretia was abominable in every way a vixen she tormented andrea from morning till night with her bitter tongue she did not love him in the least but only what his money could buy for her for she was extravagant and drove the sensitive artist to his grave while she outlived him forty years about the time of the artists marriage he painted one fresco the procession of the magi in which he placed a very splendid substitute for his wife namely himself afterward he painted the dead christ which found its way to france and it laid the foundation for andreas wrongdoing this picture was greatly admired by the king of france who above all else was a lover of art francis i asked andrea to go to his court as he had commissions for him he made andrea a money offer and to court he went he took a pupil with him but he left his wife at home at the court of francis i he was received with great honours and amid those new and gracious surroundings away from the tantalising charms of his wife and her shrewish tongue he began to have an honest ambition to do great things his work for france was undertaken with enthusiasm but no sooner was he settled and at peace than the irrepressible wife began to torment him with letters to return each letter distracted him more and more till he told the king in his despair that he must return home but that he would come back to france and continue his work almost at once francis i little suspecting the cause of andreas uneasiness gave him permission to go and also a large sum of money to spend upon certain fine works of art which he was to bring back to france we can well believe that andrea started back to his home with every good intention that he meant to appease his wife and also his own longing to see her to buy the king his pictures with the money entrusted to him and to return to france and finish his work but alas he no sooner got back to his wife than his virtuous purpose fled she wanted this she wanted thatand especially she wanted a fine house which could just about be built for the sum of money which the king of france had entrusted to andrea andrea is a pitiable figure but he was also a vagabond if we are to believe vasari he took the kings money built his wretched wife a mansion and never again dared return to france where his dishonesty made him forever despised afterward he was overwhelmed with despair for what he had done and he tried to make his peace with francis but while that monarch did not punish him directly for his knavery he would have no more to do with him and this was the worst punishment the artist could have had however his genius was so great that other than french people forgot his dishonesty and he began life anew in his native place almost all his pictures were on sacred subjects and finally when driven from florence to luco by the plague taking with him his wife and stepdaughter he began a picture called the madonna del sacco the madonna of the sack this fresco was to adorn the convent of the servi and the sketches for it were probably made in luco when the plague passed and the artist was able to return to florence he began to paint it upon the cloister walls andrea like leonardo painted a famous last supper although the two pictures cannot be compared in andreas picture it is said that all the faces are portraits just before the plague sent him and his family from florence a most remarkable incident took place raphael had painted a celebrated portrait of pope leo x in a group and the picture belonged to ottaviano de medici duke frederick ii of mantua longed to own this picture and at last requested the medici to give it to him the duke could not well be refused but ottaviano wanted to keep so great a work for himself what was to be done he was in great trouble over the affair the situation seemed hopeless it seemed certain that he must part with his beloved picture to the duke of mantua but one day andrea del sarto declared that he could make a copy of it that even raphael himself could not tell from his original ottaviano could scarcely believe this but he begged andrea to set about it hoping that it might be true going at the work in good earnest andrea painted a copy so exact that the pupil of raphael who had more or less to do with the original picture could not tell which was which when he was asked to choose this pupil giulio romano was so familiar with every stroke of raphaels that if he were deceived surely any one might be so the replica was given to the duke of mantua who never found out the difference years afterward giulio romano showed the picture to vasari believing it to be the original raphael neither andrea nor the medici having told romano the truth but vasari who knew the whole story declared to romano that what he showed him was but a copy romano would not believe it but vasari told him that he would find upon the canvas a certain mark known to be andreas romano looked and behold the original raphael became a del sarto the original picture hangs in the pitti palace while the copy made by andrea is in the naples gallery the introduction of andrea to vasari was one of the few gracious things that michael angelo ever did about andrea he said to raphael at the time there is a little fellow in florence who will bring sweat to your brows if ever he is engaged in great works raphael would certainly have agreed with him had he known what was to happen in regard to the leo x picture notwithstanding andreas unfortunate temperament which caused him to be guided mostly by circumstances instead of guiding them he was said to be improving all the time in his art he had a great many pupils but none of them could tolerate his wife for long so they were always changing throughout his life the artist longed for tenderness and encouragement from his wife and finally without ever receiving it he died in a desolate way untended even by her after the siege of florence there came a pestilence and andrea was overtaken by it his wife afraid that she too would become ill would have nothing to do with him she kept away and he died quite alone few caring that he was dead and no one taking the trouble to follow him to his grave thus one of the greatest of florentine painters lived and died years after his death the artist jacopo da empoli was copying andreas birth of the virgin when an old woman of about eighty years on her way to mass stopped to speak with him she pointed to the beautiful virgins face in the picture and said i am that woman and so she wasthe widow of the great andrea though she had treated him so cruelly she was glad to have it known that she was the widow of the dead genius platethe madonna del sacco madonna of the sack this picture is a fresco in the cloister of the annunziata at florence and it is called of the sack because joseph is posed leaning against a sack a book open upon his knees doubtless the model for this madonna is andrea del sartos abominable wife but she looks very sweet and simple in the picture the folds of marys garments are beautifully painted so is the poise of her head and all the details of the picture except the figure of the child there is a line of stiffness there and it lacks the softness of many other pictures of the infant jesus platethe holy family in this picture in the pitti palace florence andrea del sarto represents all the characters in a serious mood there are st john and elizabeth mary and the infant jesus and there is no touch of playfulness such as may be found in similar groups by other artists of the time attention is concentrated upon jesus who seems to be learning from his young cousin the left hand resting upon marys arm is badly drawn and in character does not seem to belong to the figure of the child a full overhanging upper lip is a dominant feature in each face other works of andrea del sarto are charity which is in the louvre madonna dell arpie a head of christ the dead christ four saints joseph in egypt his own portrait and josephs dream ii michael angelo buonarroti pronounced meekelahnjelo bwonearrotee florentine school 14751564 pupil of ghirlandajo this wonderful man did more kinds of things at a time when almost all artists were versatile than any other but one probably leonardo da vinci was gifted in as many different ways as michael angelo and in his own lines was as powerful this florentines life was as tragic as it was restless there is a tablet in a room of a castle which stands high upon a rocky mount near the village of caprese which tells that michael angelo was born in that place the great castle is now in ruins and more than four hundred years of fame have passed since the little child was born therein the unhappy existence of the artist seems to have been foreshadowed by an accident which happened to his mother before he was born she was on horseback riding with her husband to his official post at chiusi for he was governor of chiusi and caprese her horse stumbled fell and badly hurt her this was two months before michael angelo was born and misfortune ever pursued him the father of angelo was descended from an aristocratic housethe counts of canossa were his ancestorsand in that day the profession of an artist was not thought to be dignified hence the father had quite different plans for the boy but the son persisted and at last had his way when he was still a little child his father finished his work as an official at caprese and returned to florence but he left the little angelo behind with his nurse that nurse was the wife of a stonemason and almost as soon as the boy could toddle he used to wander about the quarries where the stonecutters worked and doubtless the baby joy of angelo was to play at chiseling as it is the pleasure of modern babies to play at pegtop after a time he was sent for to go to florence to begin his education in florence he fell in with a young chap who like himself loved art but who was fortunate enough already to be apprenticed to the great painter of his timeghirlandajo one happy day this young granacci volunteered to take michael angelo to his masters studio and there angelo made such an impression on ghirlandajo that he was urged by the artist to become his pupil all the world began to seem rose coloured to the ambitious boy and he started his lifework with enthusiasm at that time he was thirteen years old full of hope and of love for his kind but his good fortune did not last long he had hardly settled to work in ghirlandajos studio than his genius which should have made him beloved made him hated by his master angelo drew superior designs created new artideas was more clever in all his undertakings than any other pupileven ahead of his master and almost at once ghirlandajo became furiously jealous this enmity between pupil and master was the beginning of angelos many misfortunes one day he got into a dispute with a fellow student torregiano who broke his nose this deformity alone was a tragedy to one like michael angelo who loved everything beautiful yet must go through life knowing himself to be illfavoured in height he was a little man topped by an abnormally large head which was part of the penalty he had to pay for his talents he had a great broad forehead and an eye that did not gleam nor express the beauty of his creative mind but was dull and lustreless matching his broken flattened nose indeed he was a tragedy to himself in the history of painting muther describes his unhappy disposition in his youthful years he never learned what love meant if thou wishest to conquer me in old age he addresses love give me back my features from which nature has removed all beauty whenever in his sonnets he speaks of passion it is always of pain and tears of sadness and unrequited longing never of the fulfilment of his wishes then too michael angelo had a quarrelsome disposition and he was harsh in his criticism of others he hated leonardo da vinci more for his great physical beauty than for his genius he quarreled with most of his contemporaries never joined the assemblies of his brother artists but dwelt altogether apart his was a gloomy and melancholy disposition and he never found relief outside his work he was all kinds of an artistpoet sculptor architect painterand although he worked with the irregularity of true genius he worked indefatigably when once he began it is said that when he was making his david he never removed his clothing the whole time he was employed upon the work but dropped down when too exhausted to work more and slept wherever he fell his first flight from the workshop of ghirlandajo was to the gardens of the great florentine prince lorenzo de medici who had sent to ghirlandajo for two of his best pupils he wished them to come to his gardens and study the beautiful greek statues which ornamented them the choice fell to angelo and granacci probably those statues in lorenzos garden were the first glimpses of really great art that michael angelo ever had certain it is that he was overwhelmed with happiness when he was given permission to copy what he would and at once he fell to work with his chisel his first work in that garden was upon the head of an old faun and lorenzo walking by curious to know to what use the lad was putting his opportunity made a criticism you have made your faun old he said yet you have left all the teeth at such an age generally the teeth are wanting angelo had nothing to say and the prince walked on but when next he came that way he found that angelo had broken off two of the fauns teeth and this recognition of his criticism pleased lorenzo so much that he invited angelo to live with him at first his father objected he felt himself to be an aristocrat and sculpture and painting were indeed low occupations for his son who he had resolved should be nothing less than a silk merchant nevertheless the princes command united with the sons pleading compelled the father to give up his cherished dream of making a merchant of him and angelo went to live in the palace then indeed what seemed a beautiful life opened out he was dressed in fine clothing dined with princes and possibly he was grateful to his patron some historians say so and add that when lorenzo died angelo wept and returned sadly to his fathers house to mourn but this tale seems at odds with what else we know of angelos unangelic envious and bitter disposition it is quite certain however that with the death of lorenzo angelos fortunes became greatly changed another prince followed in linepietro de medicibut he was a poor thing who brought little good to anybody he had small use for michael angelos genius but it is said that he did give him one commission after a great storm one day he asked him to make a snowman for him and angelo obligingly complied it was doubtless a very beautiful snowman but although it was angelos it melted in the night even as if it had been johnnys or tommys snowman and left no trace behind in rome there was a high and haughty pope on the thronejulius iiwho had probably not his match for obstinacy and haughtiness excepting in the great painter and sculptor when angelo went to rome he was bound to come in conflict with julius for it was popes and princes who gave art any reason for being in those days and the church prescribed what kind of art should be cultivated michael was to come directly under the command of the pope and such a combination promised trouble kings themselves had to remove their crowns and hats to julius and why not michael angelo yet there he stood covered before the pope opposing his greatness to that of the pope soderini says that angelo treated the pope as the king of france never would have dared treat him but angelo may have known that kings of france might be born and die times without number while there would never be born another michael angelo there could be nothing but antagonism between angelo and julius and soon after the artist returned to florence but the necessity for following his profession enabled julius to tame him after all and it is said that the pope led him back to rome later with a halter about his neck this must have been agony to angelo back in rome he was commissioned to make a tomb for the pope he had no sooner set about the preliminariesthe getting of suitable marble for his workthan he began to quarrel with the men who were to hew it when that difficulty was settled and the marble was got out he had a setto with the shipowners who were to transport the stone and that row became so serious that the sculptor was besieged in his own house at another and later time when he was engaged upon the frescoes of the sistine chapel he was made to work by force he accused the man who had built the scaffolding upon which he must stand or lie to paint of planning his destruction he suspected the very assistants whom he himself had chosen to go from florence of having designs upon his life he locked the chapel against them and they had to turn away when they went to begin work because of his insane suspicion he did alone the enormous work of the frescoes doubtless he was half mad just as he was wholly a genius by the time he had finished those frescoes he was so exhausted and overworked that he wrote piteously to his people at home i have not a friend in rome neither do i wish nor have use for any this of course was not true or he would not have made the statement i hardly find time to take nourishment not an ounce more can i bear than already rests upon my shoulders even when the work was done he felt no happiness because of it but complained about everything and everybody if angelo thought this an unhappy day worse was in store for him julius ii died and in his place there came to reign upon the papal throne leo x if michael angelo had been restricted in his work before he was almost jailed under leo x julius had been a virile forceful man and michael angelo was the same since he must be restrained and dictated to it was possible for the artist to listen to a man who was in certain respects strong like himself but to be under the thumb of a weak effeminate person like leo was the tragedy of tragedies to angelo that was a marvellous time in rome all its citizens had become so pleasureloving that the world stood still to wonder when the pope banqueted he had the golden plates from which fair women had eaten hurled into the tiber that they might never be profaned by a less noble use than they had known from all this riot and madness of pleasure michael angelo stood aside with frowning brow and scornful mien he approved of nothing and of nobodydespising even raphael the gentle and loving man whom the pleasurecrazed people of rome paused to smile upon and love the pope said that angelo was terrible and that he filled everybody with fear finally rome so resented his frowning looks and his surly ways that work was provided for him at a distance he was sent to florence again to build a facade while there the city was conquered and angelo was one who fought for its freedom but even so he fled just at the crisis thus he ever did the wrong thingexcepting when he worked in florence he had planned to do mighty things but he never accomplished any one of them he planned to make a wonderful colossal statue on a cliff near carrara and also he resolved to make the tomb of julius the nucleus of a forest of statues michael angelo never married but he was burdened with a family and all its cares he supported his brothers and even his nephews and took care of his father all of those people came to him with their difficulties and with their demands for money he chided quarreled repelled yet met every obligation he would sit beside the sickbed of a servant the night through but growl at the demands of his near relativesand it is not unlikely that he had good reason at last he withdrew himself from all human society but that of little children whom he cared to speak with and to please he would have naught to do with men of genius like himself and when he fell from a scaffolding and injured himself the physician had to force his way through a barred window in order to get into the sick mans presence to serve him an illustration of his determined solitude is given in the young peoples story of art there had long been lying idle in florence an immense block of marble one hundred years before a sculptor had tried to carve something from it but had failed this was now given to michael angelo he was to be paid twelve dollars a month and to be allowed two years in which to carve a statue he made his design in wax and then built a tower around the block so that he might work inside without being seen everything angelo undertook bore the marks of gigantic enterprise although he never succeeded in making the tomb of julius ii the central piece in his forest of statues the undertaking was marvellous enough his original plan was to make the tomb three stories high and to ornament it with forty statues and if st peters church was large enough to hold it the work was to be placed therein but if not a church was to be built specially to hold the tomb when at last in spite of his difficulties with workmen and shipowners the marbles were deposited in the great square before st peters they filled the whole place and the pope wishing to watch the progress of the work and not himself to be observed had a covered way built from the vatican to the workshop of angelo in the square by which he might come and go as he chose while an order was issued that the sculptor was to be admitted at all times to the vatican no sooner was this arrangement completed than angelos enemies frightened the pope by telling him there was danger in making his tomb before his death and with these superstitions haunting him julius ii stopped the work leaving angelo without the means to pay for his marbles with the doors of the vatican closed to him angelo withdrew post haste to florenceand who can blame him nevertheless the work was resumed after infinite trouble on the popes part he had to send again and again for angelo and after forty years the work was finished there the sequel of the sculptors fortyyears war with self and the world stands today in moses the wonderful commanding central figure which seems to reflect all the fierce power which angelo had to keep in check during a lifetime the command of julius that he should paint the ceiling of the sistine chapel aroused all his fierce resistance he did it under protest all the while accusing those about him of having designs upon his life i am not a painter but a sculptor he said such a man as thou is everything that he wishes to be the pope replied but this is an affair of raphael give him this room to paint and let me carve a mountain but no he must paint the ceiling but to render it easier for him the pope told him he might fill in the spaces with saints and charge a certain amount for each this angelo who was first of all an artist refused to do he would do the work rightly or not at all so he made his own plans and cut himself a cardboard helmet into the front of which he thrust a candle as if it were a davy lamp and he lay upon his back to work day and night at the hated task during those months he was compelled to look up so continually that never afterward was he able to look down without difficulty when he had finished the work julius had some criticisms to make those dresses on your saints are such poor things he said not rich enoughsuch very poor things well they were poor things was angelos answer the saints did not wear golden ornaments nor gold on their garments after julius ii and leo x came pope paul iii and he like the other two determined to have angelo for his workman indeed all his life michael angelos gifts were commanded by the church of rome it was for paul iii he painted the last judgment his former work upon the sistine chapel had been the story of the creation all his work was of a mighty and allegorical nature tremendous shoulders mighty limbs herculean muscles that seemed fit to support the universe these allegories are made of hundreds of figures today they are still there though dimmed by the smoke of centuries of incense and dismembered by the cracking of plaster and disintegration of materials angelos methods of work as well as their results were oppressive in his youth while trying to perfect himself in his study of the human form he drew or modelled from nude corpses he had these conveyed by stealth from the hospital into the convent of santo spirito where he had a cell and there he worked alone he was concentrated mentally and emotionally upon himself the only remark he made after the blow from torregiano was you will be remembered only as the man who broke my nose this proved nearly true since torregiano was banished and murdered by the spanish inquisition all sorts of anecdotes have floated through the centuries concerning this man and his work for example he made a statue of a sleeping cupid which was buried in the ground for a time that it might assume the appearance of age and pass for an antique afterward it was sold to the cardinal san giorgio for two hundred ducats though michael angelo received only thirty nevertheless he died a rich man after having cared for a numerous family while he himself lived like a man without means all the tranquillity he ever knew he enjoyed in his old age it was characteristic of his perversity that he left his name upon nothing that he made with one exception vasari relates the story of that exception the love and care which michael angelo had given to this group in paradise were such that he there left his namea thing he never did again for any workon the cincture which girdles the robe of our lady for it happened one day that michael angelo entering the place where it was erected found a large assemblage of strangers from lombardy there who were praising it highly one of them asking who had done it was told our hunchback of milan hearing which michael angelo remained silent although surprised that his work should be attributed to another but one night he repaired to st peters with a light and his chisels to engrave his name on the figure which seems to breathe a spirit as perfect as her form and countenance if his youth had been given to sculpture his maturity to the painting of wondrous frescoes so his old age was devoted to architecture and as architect he rebuilt the decaying st peters in this work he felt that he partly realised his ideal sculpture meant more to him did more for the glory of god than any other form of art when he had finished his work on st peters he is said to have looked upon it and exclaimed i have hung the pantheon in the air this colossal genius died in rome and was carried by the light of torches from that city back to his better loved florence where he was buried his tomb was made in the santa croce and upon it are three female figures representing michael angelos three wonderful arts architecture sculpture and painting no artist was greater than he his will committed his soul to god his body to the earth and his property to his nearest relatives platedaniel this wonderful painting is a part of the decoration of the sistine chapel in rome the picture of the prophet tells so much in itself that a description seems absurd it is enough to call attention to the powerful muscles in the arm the fall of the hand and then to speak of the main characteristics of the artists pictures it is extraordinary that there is no blade of grass to be found in any painting by michael angelo he loved to paint but one thing and that was the naked man the powerful muscles or the twisted limbs of those in great agony he loved only to work upon vast spaces of ceiling or wall look at this picture of daniel and see how like sculpture the pose and modelling appear to be first of all michael angelo was a sculptor and most of the painting which fate forced him to do has the characteristics of sculpture one critic has remarked that he loves to think of this strange man sitting before the marble quarry of pietra santa and thinking upon all the beings hidden in the cliffbeings which he should fashion from the marble it was said that in michael angelos hands the holy family became a race of titans and where others would have put plants or foliage angelo placed men and naked limbs to fill the space when his subject made some sort of herbage necessary he invented a kind of medival fern in place of grass and familiar leaves everything appears brazen and hard and mighty suggestive of angelos own throbbing spirit and maddened soul most of his work when illustrated must be shown not as a whole but in sections but one can best mention them as entire picture themes on the ceiling of the sistine chapel are nine frescoes describing the creation of the world the fall of man and the deluge the last judgment occupies the entire altar wall in the same chapel of the vatican the holy family is in the uffizi gallery florence iii arnold bcklin pronounced beklin modern german school dsseldorf 18271901 this splendid artist is so lately dead that it does not seem proper yet to discuss his personal history but we can speak understandingly of his art for we already know it to be great art which will stand the test of time his imagination turned toward subjects of solemn grandeur and his work is very impressive and beautiful he was born in basel one of the most prosaic towns in europe his father was a swiss merchant and not poor thus the son had ordinarily good chances to make an artist of himself he was born at a time when to be an artist had long ceased to be a reproach and men no longer discouraged their sons who felt themselves inspired to paint great pictures when bcklin was nineteen years old he took himself to dsseldorf with his merchant fathers permission and settled down to learn his art but in that city he found mostly sentimental and anecdotal pictures being painted which did not suit him at all then he took himself off to brussels where again he was not satisfied and so went to paris but while in brussels he had copied many old masters and had advanced himself very much so that he did not present himself in paris raw and untried in art at first he studied in the louvre then went to rome seeking ever the best and being hard to satisfy he found rest and tranquillity in zrich a city in his native country but it was italy that had most influenced his work he loved the campagna of rome with its ruins and the sad grandeur of the crumbling tombs lining its way and therefore a certain mysterious grand and solemn character made his pictures unlike those of any other artist he loved to paint in vertical upanddown fines rather than with the conventional horizontal outlines that we find in most paintings this method gives his pictures a different quality from any others in the world he loved best of all to paint landscape and it is said of him that as the greeks peopled their streams and woods and waves with creatures of their imagination so bcklin makes the waterfall take shape as a nymph or the mists which rise above the water source wreathe into forms of merry children or in some wild spot hurls centaurs together in fierce combat or makes the slippery moving wave give birth to nereids and tritons muther artcritic and biographer calls our attention to the similarity between wagners music and bcklins painting while wagner was luring the colours of sound from music bcklins symphonies of colour streamed forth like a crashing orchestra and he calls him the greatest colourpoet of the time in appearance bcklin was fine of form healthy and wholesome in all his thoughts and way of living in 1848 he took part in revolutionary politics and later this did him great harm only the influence of his friends kept him from ruin after the francoprussian war he was made minister of fine arts in this office he rendered great service but because he had to witness the wrecking of the column vendme in order to save the louvre and the luxembourg from the mob he was censured indeed so heavy a fine was imposed that it took his whole fortune to pay it and he was banished into the bargain from 1892 to 1901 he lived in or near florence and he died at fiesole january 16th 1901 platethe isle of the dead this picture is perhaps the greatest of the many great arnold bcklin paintings and it is both fascinating and aweinspiring it best shows his liking for vertical lines in art the isle of the dead is of a rocky shaftlike formation in which we may see hewnout tombs and there tall cypress trees are growing the traces of mans work in the midst of this sombre ideal and mystic scene add to the impressiveness of the picture the isle stands high and lonely in the midst of a sea the water seems silently to lap the base of the rocks and the trees are in black shadow massed in the centre it looks very mysterious and still there is a stone gateway touched with the light of a dying day it is sunset and the dead is being brought to its resting place in a tiny boat all the smaller for its relation to the gloomy grandeur of the isle which it is approaching one figure is standing in the boat facing the island and the sunlight falls full upon his back and touches the boat making that spot stand out brilliantly from all the rest of the picture among bcklins paintings are naiads at play which hangs in the museum at basel a villa by the sea the sport of the waves regions of joy flora and venus dispatching cupid iv marierosa bonheur pronounced rosa boner french school 18221895 pupil of raymond b bonheur rosa bonheur landseer and murillo maybe called childrens painters in this book because they painted things that children as well as grownups certainly can enjoy to be sure murillo was a very different sort of artist from rosa bonheur or landseer but if the two latter painted the most beautiful animalsdogs sheep and horsesmurillo painted the loveliest little children rosa was the best pupil of her father raymond b bonheur in bordeaux they lived together the peaceful life of artists the father being already a well known painter when his daughter was born she became as mr hamerton who knew her said the most accomplished female painter who ever lived a pure generous woman as well and can hardly be too much admired as a woman or an artist she is simple in her tastes and habits of life and many stories are told of her generosity to others after a time the bonheurs moved to paris where young rosa could have better opportunities and there she put on mans clothing which she wore all her life thereafter she wore a workingmans blouse and trousers and tramped about looking more like a man than a woman with her short hair this made everybody stare at her and think her very queer but people no longer believe that she dressed herself thus in order to advertise herself and attract attention but because it was the most convenient costume for her to get about in she went to all sorts of places the stockyards slaughter houses all about the streets of paris to learn of things and people especially of animals which she wished most to paint she could hardly have gone about thus if she had worn womens clothing rosa bonheur exhibited her first painting at the salon in 1841 and this was twelve years before her beloved father died thus he had the happiness of knowing that the daughter whom he had taught so lovingly was on the road to success and fortune he knew that when fortune should come to her she would use it well the year that she exhibited her work in the salon she painted only two little picturesone of rabbits the other of sheep and goatsbut they were so splendidly done that all the critics knew a great woman artist had arrived it was then that her enemies those who were becoming jealous of her work said that she was wearing mens clothing in order to attract attention to herself soon her work began to be bought by the french government which was a sure sign of her power she was already much beloved by the people in the meantime we in america and others in england had heard of mademoiselle bonheur but we heard far less about her painting than we did about her masculine garb we thought of her mostly as an eccentric woman but one day came the horse fair and all the world heard of that so the artist was to be no longer judged by the clothes she wore but by her art finally she received the cross of the legion of honour and also was made a member of the institute of antwerp she lived near fontainebleau her studio a peaceful retired home till the francoprussian war came about then she and others began to fear that her studio and pictures would be destroyed so the artist was forced to stop her work and prepared to go elsewhere but the crown prince of prussia himself ordered that mademoiselle bonheur should not even be disturbed her work had made her belong to all the world and all the world was to protect her if need be rosa bonheur had a brother who some critics said was the better artist but if that were true it is likely that his popularity would in some degree have approached that of his sister rosa bonheur did not paint many large canvases but mostly small ones or only moderately large but when she painted sheep it seems that one might shear the wool it stands so fleecy and full while her horses rampage and curvet showing themselves off as if they were alive platethe horse fair this picture was exhibited all over the world very nearly it was carried to england and to america and won admiration wherever it was seen finally it was sold in america it was first exhibited in 1853 the year in which the artists father died mr ernest gambart was the first who bought the picture and he wrote of it to his friend mr sp avery i will give you the real history of the horse fair now in new york it was painted in 1852 by rosa bonheur then in her thirtieth year and exhibited in the next salon though much admired it did not find a purchaser it was soon after exhibited in ghent meeting again with much appreciation but was not sold as art did not flourish at the time in 1855 the picture was sent by rosa bonheur to her native town of bordeaux and exhibited there she offered to sell it to the town at the very low price 12000 francs 2400 while there i asked her if she would sell it to me and allow me to take it to england and have it engraved she said i wish to have my picture remain in france i will once more impress on my countrymen my wish to sell it to them for 12000 francs if they refuse you can have it but if you take it abroad you must pay me 40000 francs the town failing to make the purchase i at once accepted these terms and rosa bonheur then placed the picture at my disposal i tendered her the 40000 francs and she said i am much gratified at your giving me such a noble price but i do not like to feel that i have taken advantage of your liberality let us see how we can combine in the matter you will not be able to have an engraving made from so large a canvas suppose i paint you a small one from the same subject of which i will make you a present of course i accepted the gift and thus it happened that the large work went travelling over the kingdom on exhibition while thomas landseer was making an engraving from the quartersize replica after some time in 1857 i think i sold the original picture to mr william p wright new york whose picture gallery and residence were at weehawken nj for the sum of 30000 francs but later i understood that mr stewart paid a much larger price for it on the breaking up of mr wrights gallery the quarter size replica from which the engraving was made i finally sold to mr jacob bell who gave it in 1859 to the nation and it is now in the national gallery london a second still smaller replica was painted a few years later and was resold some time ago in london for 4000 20000 there is also a smaller watercolour drawing which was sold to mr bolckow for 2500 guineas 12000 and is now an heirloom belonging to the town of middlesbrough that is the whole history of this grand work the stewart canvas is the real and true original and only large size horsefair once in mr stewarts collection it never left his gallery until the auction sale of his collection march 25th 1887 when it was purchased by mr cornelius vanderbilt for the sum of 55000 and presented to the metropolitan museum of art and thus we have the whole story of the horsefair the picture is 9312 inches high and 197 inches wide and it contains a great number of horses some of which are ridden while others are led and all are crowding with wild gaiety toward the fair where it is quite plain they know they are about to be admired and their beauty shown to the best advantage other wellknown rosa bonheurs are ploughing shepherd guarding sheep highland sheep scotch deer american mustangs and the study of a lioness v alessandro botticelli pronounced ahlayssahndro bottechellee florentine school 14471510 vasaris dates pupil of filippo lippi and verrocchio botticelli took his name from his first master as was the fashion in those days the relation of master and apprentice was very close not at all like the relation of pupil and teacher today botticellis father was a florentine citizen mariano filipepi and he wished his son to become a goldsmith hence the lad was soon apprenticed to botticelli the goldsmith as a scholar the little goldsmith had not distinguished himself indeed it is said that as a boy he would not take to any sort of schooling in reading writing or arithmetic it cannot be said that this failure distinguished him as a genius or the world would be full of geniusboys but the result was that he early began to learn his trade fortunately for him and us botticelli the smith was a man of some wisdom and when he saw that the lad originated beautiful designs and had creative genius he did not treat the matter with scorn as the master of andrea del sarto had done but sent him instead to fra filippo lippo lippi to be taught the art of painting so kind a deed might well establish a feeling of devotion on little alessandros part and make him wish to take his masters name fra filippo was a carmelite monk merry and kindly simple good and gifted but his temperament did not seem to influence his young pupil of all unhappy morbid men botticelli seems to have been the most so unless we are to except michael angelo after studying with the monk botticelli was summoned by pope sixtus iv to rome to decorate a new chapel in the vatican before that time his whole life had been greatly influenced by the teachings of savonarola who had preached both passionately and learnedly in florence advocating liberty from the time he fell under savonarolas wonderful power the artist grew more and more mystic and morbid in rome it was the custom to have the portraits of conspirators or persons of high degree who were revolutionary or otherwise objectionable to the state hung outside the public palace and in botticellis time there was a famous disturbance among the aristocrats of the state in 1478 the powerful pazzi family conspired against the medici family which then actually had control it was botticelli who was engaged to paint the portraits of the pazzi family which to their shame and humiliation were to be displayed upon the palace walls one peculiarity of this artists pictures was that he used actual goldleaf to make the high lights upon hair leaves and draperies the effect of the use of this gold was very beautiful if unusual and it may have been that his apprenticeship as a goldsmith suggested to him such a device also it was he who created certain characteristics of painting that have since been thought original with burnejones this was the use of long stiff lilystalks or other upright details in his compositions examples of this idea which produced so weird an effect will be found in his allegory of spring where stiff treetrunks form a part of the background in the madonna of the palms upright lilystalks are held in pale and trembling hands like michael angelo who came years afterward botticelli was a guest of the great lorenzo the magnificent in florence it was by botticellis hand that the greater painter sent a letter to lorenzo from a duchess friend who was also his patron this was in angelos youth in botticellis old age all his life was a drama of morbid seeking after the unattainable and finally he became so poor and helpless that in his old age he would have starved had lorenzo de medici not taken care of him lorenzo and other friends who in spite of his gloominess admired his real piety gathered about him and kept him from starvation on his nativity botticelli wrote this picture i alessandro painted at the end of the year 1500 in the troubles of italy in the halftime after the time during the fulfilment of the eleventh of john in the second woe of the apocalypse in the loosing the devil for three and a half years afterward he shall be chained according to the twelfth of john and see him trodden down as in this picture all of this is interesting because botticelli himself wrote it but it is not very easily understood by any child nor by many grown people botticelli did some very extraordinary things but whether they are beautiful or not one must decide for himself they are paintings so characteristic that one must think them very beautiful or else not at all so platela primavera spring in this picture we have the forerunner of a modern painter because we see in it certain qualities that we find in bcklin look at the effect of vertical lines the tree trunks and the poses of the slender women over all hovers a cupid who is sending loveshafts into the hearts of all in springtime notice the lacy effect of the flowers that bestar the windblown gown of la primavera the fernlike leaves that fleck the background the draperies that do not conceal the forms of the nymphs of the lovely springtime the very spirit of spring is seen in all the halffloating halfdancing gliding diaphanous figures of the forest the flowers of la primaveras crown are blue and white cornflowers and primroses she scatters over the earth tulips anemones and narcissus the painting is allegorical and unique never were such fluttering odds and ends of draperies painted before nor such fascinating effects had from canvas paint or brush the picture hangs in florence in the uffizi gallery a german critic tells us that the realm of venus is a better title for this picture and that it was painted after a poem of that name other pictures by this artist are the birth of venus pallas judith holofernes st augustine adoration of the magi and st sebastian vi william adolphe bouguereau pronounced w adolf bougairroh french genre school 18251905 pupil of picot and the ecole des beauxarts bouguereaus businesslike father meant his son also to be businesslike but he made the mistake of permitting him to go to a drawing school in bordeaux and there to his fathers chagrin the youngster took the annual prize after that there seemed nothing for the father to do but grin and bear it because the son decided to be an artist and had fairly won his right to be one young bouguereau had no money and therefore he went to live with an uncle at saintonge a priest who had much sympathy with the boys wish to paint and he left him free to do the best he could for himself in art he got a chance to paint some portraits and when he and his uncle talked the matter over it was decided that he should take the money got for them and go to paris it was there that he sought picot his first truly helpful teacher and there for the first time he learned more than he already knew about art all bouguereaus opportunities in life were made by himself by his own genius no one gave him anything he earned all he longed to go to italy and in the ecole des beauxarts he won the prix de rome which made possible a journey to the land of great artists the french government began to buy his work and he began to receive commissions to decorate walls in great buildings thus gradually he made for himself fame and fortune when this artist undertook to paint sacred subjects of great dignity he was not at his best but when he chose children and mothers and everyday folk engaged about their everyday business he painted beautifully americans have bought many of his pictures and he has had more popularity in this country than anywhere outside of france some authorities give the birthplace of bouguereau as la rochelle at any rate he died there at midnight on the nineteenth of august 1905 platethe virgin as consoler the main distinction about this artists pictured faces is the peculiarly earnest expression he has given to the eyes in this picture of the virgin there is great genius in the pose and deathlook of the little child whose mother has flung herself across the lap of mary abandoned to her agony this painting is hung in the luxembourg others by the same master are called psyche and cupid birth of venus innocence and at the well vii sir edward burnejones english preraphaelite school 18331898 pupil of rossetti this artist has been called the most original of all contemporaneous artists he has also been called the lyric painter meaning that he is to painting what the lyric poet is to literature his work once known can almost always be recognised wherever seen afterward he did not slavishly follow the preraphaelite school yet he drew most of his ideas from its methods he was in the use of stiff lines a follower of botticelli and not original in that detail as some have seemed to think platechant damour the lovesong this is a picture in the true burnejones style a beautiful woman in billowy draperies playing upon a harp forms the central figure of the group of threea listener on either side of her there is the attractiveness of the burnejones method about this picture but after all there seems to be no very good reason for its having been painted the subject thus treated has only a negative value and little suggestion of thought or dramatic idea another picture of this artist in which his use of stiff draperies is specially shown is that of the women at the tomb of christ when they find the stone rolled away and looking around see the saviours figure before them the scene is low and cavernlike with a brilliant light surrounding the tomb this artist also painted the vestal virgin king cophetua and the beggar maid pan and psyche the golden stairs and love among the ruins viii john constable english school 17761837 pupil of the royal academy john constable was the son of a yeoman farmer who meant to make him also a yeoman farmer mostly we find that the fathers of our artists had no higher expectations for their sons than to have them take up their own business to begin as they had and to end as they expected to but in john constables case as with all the others the fathers methods of living did not at all please the son and having most of all a liking for picturemaking young john set himself to planning his own affairs nevertheless the foundation of johns art was laid right there in the suffolk farmers home and conditions he was born in east bergholt and the father seems to have believed in windmills for early in life the signs of wind and weather became a part of the sons education he learned a deal more of atmospheric conditions there on his fathers windmill planted farm than he could possibly have learned shut up in a studio french fashion as a little boy he came to know all the signs of the heavens the clouds gathering for storm or shine the bending of the trees in the blast all of these he loved and later on made the principal subjects of his art he learned to observe these things as a matter of business and at his fathers command thus we may say that he studied his lifework from his very infancy all about him were beautiful hedgerows picturesque cottages with high pitched roofs covered with thatch and it was these beauties which bred one other great landscape painter besides constable of whom we shall presently speak gainsborough at last graduating from windmills john went to london he had a vacation from the work set him by his father and for two years he painted cottages studied anatomy and did the drudgery of his art but there was little money in it for him and soon he had to go into his fathers counting house for windmills seemed to have paid the elder constable considerably better than painting promised to pay young john john doubtless liked countinghouse work even less than he had done the study of windmills and weather in his fathers fields he was a most persistent fellow however and finally he returned to london to study again the art he loved this time in the royal academy which meant that he had made some progress his father gave him very little aid to do the things he longed to do but after his fathers death he found that a little money was coming to him from the estate4000 he had already triumphed over his difficulties by painting his first fine pictures he now knew that he was to become a successful artist and be able to take care of himself and a wife though in love he had hitherto been too poor to marry his first splendid work was dedham vale though things were going very well with him it was not until paris discovered him that he achieved great success in 1824 he painted two large pictures which he took to paris and there he found fame the best landscape painting in france dates from the time when constables works were hung in the louvre to become the delight of all artlovers he received a gold medal from charles x and became more honoured abroad than he had ever been at home constable had many enemies and made many more after he became an academician some artists who would have liked that honour and who could not gain it for themselves declared that constable painted with a palette knife though it certainly would not have mattered if he had since he made great pictures he painted things exactly as he saw them and was not a popular artist most of all he loved to paint the scenes that he had known so well in his youth and he did them over and over again as if the subject was one in which he wished to reach perfection when he died he left a picture arundel castle and mill standing with its paint wet upon his easel for he passed away very suddenly on april 1st leaving behind him many unsold paintings he was a sensitive chap and throughout his youth was greatly distressed by the differences of opinion between himself and his father he was torn asunder between a sense of duty and his own wish to be an artist and his greatest consolation in this situation was in the friendship he had formed for a plumber who like himself dearly loved art the plumbers name was john dunthorne and the two men wandered about the country when not employed at their regular work and together by streams and in fields painted the same scenes at one time they hired a little room in the neighbouring village which they made into a studio constable was a handsome fellow in his youth and was known to all as the handsome miller his father the yeoman farmer with the windmills was also a miller in london he became acquainted with one john smith known as antiquity smith who taught him something of etching after he was recalled to his fathers business his mother wrote to antiquity smith that she hoped john would now attend to business by which he will please me and his father and ensure his own respectability and comforta complete expression of the middleclass british mind her satisfaction was shortlived for her son soon returned to london when his first pictures were rejected by the royal academy he showed one of them to sir benjamin west who said hopefully dont be disheartened young man we shall hear of you again you must have loved nature very much before you could have painted this about that time he tried to paint many kinds of pictures such as portraits and sacred subjects but he did not seem to succeed in anything except the scenes of his boyhood which he truly loved hence he gave up attempting that which he could do only passably and kept to what he could do supremely well when his friends wished him to continue portrait painting the only thing that was well paid at that time constable wrote you know i have always succeeded best with my native scenes they have always charmed me and i hope they always will i have now a path marked out very distinctly for myself and i am desirous of pursuing it uninterruptedly about the time he fell in love and before his fathers death his health began to fail and the young womans mother would have none of him her father was in favour of constable but he could not hold out against the chance of his daughter losing her grandfathers fortune by marrying the wrong man the lady was not so distractingly in love as young constable was and she did not entirely like the idea of poverty even with john so she held off and with so much anxiety constable became downright ill for five years the pair lived apart and then the artist and the young woman whose name was maria bicknell lost their mothers about the same time this drew them very closely together and to help the matter on johns attendance upon his father in his last illness brought him to the same town as miss bicknell after his fathers death he urged the young lady so strongly to be his wife that she consented they were married and her father soon forgave her but not so her grandfather who declared that he never would forgive her but he really must have done so from the first for when he died it was found that he had left her a little fortune of 4000 this was about the same amount the artist had received from his father so that they were able to get on very well after constables marriage he went on a visit to sir george beaumont and there an amusing incident occurred which is known today as the story of sir georges brown tree it seems that constables ideas of colour for his landscapes were so true to nature that a good many people did not approve of them and one day while painting sir george declared that the colour of an old cremona fiddle was the best model of colour tone that a landscape could have constables only answer was to place the fiddle on the green lawn in front of the house at another time his host asked the artist do you not find it very difficult to determine where to place your brown tree not at all was constables reply for i never put such a thing into a picture in my life in painting one picture many times he declared its light cannot be put out because it is the light of nature a frenchman called attention to one of his pictures thus look at these landscapes by an englishman the ground appears to be covered with dew notwithstanding the little fortune of his wife and himself constable was not quite carefree because he had to raise a good sized family of six children so that when his wifes father died and left his daughter 20000 he said to a friend now i shall stand before a sixfoot canvas with a mind at ease thank god in the very midst of this happiness his beloved wife became ill with consumption and was certain to die he no longer cared very much for life and wrote very sadly i have been ill but am endeavouring to get work again and could i get afloat upon a canvas of six feet i might have a chance of being carried from myself when he became a member of the royal academy he said it has been delayed until i am solitary and cannot impart it meaning that without his dear wife to share his good fortune it seemed an empty honour to him strange things are told which show how little his work was valued by his countrymen after he had become a member of the academy one of his small pictures was entered but rejected nobody knowing anything about it it was put on one side among the outsiders finally one of his fellow members glancing at it was attracted stop a bit i rather like that why not say doubtful later constable acknowledged the picture as his and then they wished to hang it but he refused to let them another academy story is about his picture hadleigh castle on varnishing day chartney a brilliant critic told constable that the foreground of the picture was too cold and so he undertook to warm it by giving it a strong glaze with asphaltum with constables brush which he snatched from the artists hand constable gazed at him in horror oh there goes all my dew he cried and when chartneys back was turned he hurriedly wiped the warmth all away and got back his dew even the amusing things that happened to him seem to have a little sadness about them he wrote to a friend beechey was here yesterday and said why dn it constable what a dn fine picture you are making but you look dn ill and youve got a dn bad cold so added constable you have evidence on oath of my being about a fine picture and that i am looking ill an illustration of his painstaking and truthfulness to nature is that he once took home with him from a visit bottles of coloured sand and fragments of stone which he meant to introduce into a picture and on passing some slimy posts near a mill he said to his host i wish you could cut those off and send their tops to me constable was a loyal friend the most persistent of men and several anecdotes are told of his characteristics his friend fisher said to him where real business is to be done you are the most energetic and punctual of men in smaller matters such as putting on your breeches you are apt to lose time in deciding which leg shall go in first platethe hay wain this picture was first called landscape and it was painted in 1821 in his letters about it however constable also called it noon and others wrote of it as midsummer noon this tells us what a wealth of hot sunlight is suggested by the painting it shows a little farmhouse upon the bank of a stream a spot well known as willy lotts cottage the owner had been born there and he died there eightyeight years later without ever having left his cottage for four whole days in all those years upon the tombstone of lott which is in the bergholt burial ground his epitaph calls the house gibeon farm it was a favourite scene with constable and he painted it many times from every side it is the same house we see in the mill stream another constable painting and again in valley farm in this last picture he painted the side opposite to the one shown in the hay wain the stream near which the house stands spreads out into a ford and in the picture the hay cart with two men upon it is passing through the ford the horses are decked out with red tassels on the right of the stream there is a broad meadow golden green in the sunlight with groups of trees casting cool shadows on the grass and backed by a distant belt of woodland of rich blues and greens on the right is a fisherman half hidden by a bush standing near his punt constable wrote to his friend fisher my picture goes to the academy on the tenth this was written on april 1st 1821 it is not so grand as tinneys this shows us that constable had not vanity enough to interfere with his selfcriticism again in a letter written to him by a friend how does the hay wain look now it has got into your own room again adding that he wished to see it there away from the academy which to him was always like a great pot of boiling varnish later fisher wrote i have a great desire to possess your wain but i cannot now reach what it is worth and he begged constable not to sell it without giving him a chance to try once more to raise the money to buy it he wrote that the picture would become of greater value to his children if the artist left it hanging upon the walls of the academy till you join the society of ruysdael wilson and claude as praise and money will then be of no value to you the world will liberally bestow both later a frenchman wished to buy it for exhibition purposes and when constable wrote to fisher of this his friend replied that he had better sell it to the frenchman for the sake of the clat it may give you the stupid english public which has no judgment of its own will begin to think there is something in it if the french make your works national property you have long lain under a mistake men do not purchase pictures because they admire them but because others covet them finally the hay wain was sold to the french dealer for 250 and constable threw in a picture of yarmouth for good measure later a friend declared that he had created a good deal of argument about landscape painting and that there had come to be two divisions for he had practically founded a new school he received a gold medal for the hay wain and the french nation tried to buy it in the louvre are the cottage weymouth bay and the glebe farm elsewhere are hampstead heath salisbury cathedral the lock on the stour dedham mill the valley farm gillingham mill the cornfield boatbuilding flatford mill on the river stour besides many others ix john singleton copley english school 17371815 a little boy with a squirrel was the first picture that pointed this artist toward fame and that was painted in england and exhibited at the society of arts this americanborn irishman had no family or ancestry of account but he himself was to become the father of lord chancellor lyndhurst and he did some truly fine things in art about the same time america had another painter benjamin west marked out for fame but he got his start in europe while copley had already become a successful artist before he left boston his native place he liked best to paint interiorsrooms with fine furniture and curtains women in fine clothing and men in embroidered waistcoats and bejewelled buckles in 1777 he got into the royal academy and on the whole had considerable influence on european art if we study the portraits that he painted while in boston we can get a very complete idea of the surroundings of the royalists at the time of our colonial history platethe copley family group in this picture there are seven figures with an open landscape forming the background the baby of the family plays with uplifted arms upon grandfathers knee the mother on the couch surrounded by her three other children is kissing one while another clings to her before her stands a prim little maid gowned in the fashion of grownfolks of her day a little lock of hair falling upon her forehead suggests that when she was good she was very very good and when she was bad she was horrid she wears a little cap at the back is the artist himself in a wig and other fashions of the time a great column rises behind him forming a part of the architecture or the landscape one hardly knows which in so artificially constructed a picture copley painted also john hancock judge graham jeremiah lee and general joseph warren x jean baptiste camille corot pronounced zhahn bahteest cahmeeyel cohroh fontainebleaubarbizon school 17961875 pupil of michallon about three hundred years before corots time there was a fontainebleau school of artists made up of the pathetic andrea del sarto the wonderful leonardo da vinci and cellini these painters had been summoned from their italian homes by francis i to decorate the palace of fontainebleau the second great group of painters who had studios in the forest and beside the stream were rousseau dupr diaz and daubigny troyon van marcke jacque then millet the painter of peasants corot was born in paris and received what education the ordinary school at rouen could give him he was intended by his parents for something besides art as it would seem that every artist in the world was intended corot was to grow up and become a respectable draper at any rate a draper the young chap did as his father wished until he was twentysix years old and dreary years those must have been to him he did not get on well with his master nor did the world treat him very well he found neither riches nor the fame that was his due till he was an old man of seventy at that age he had become as rich a man as he might have been had he remained a sensible draper best of all corot loved to paint clouds and dewy nights pale moons and early day and of all amusements in the world he preferred the theatre there he would sit gay or sad as the play might make him weeping or laughing and as interested as a little child after he had anything to give away corot was the most madly generous of men it was he who gave a pension to the widow of his brother artist millet on which she lived all the rest of her days he gave money to his brother painters and to all who went to him for aid and he always gave gaily freely as if giving were the greatest joy outside of the theatre a man could have everyone who knew him loved him and there was no note of sadness in his daily life though there seems to be one in his poetical pictures because of his generous ways he was known as pere corot he sang as he worked and loved his fellowmen all the time but most of all he loved his sister rousseau is an eagle he used to say in speaking of his fellow artist as for me i am only a lark putting forth some little songs in my gray clouds it has been noted that most great landscape painters have been citybred a remarkable fact constable and gainsborough were born and bred in the country but they are exceptions to the rule corots parents were parisians of the purest dye having been courtdressmakers to napoleon i and when corot finally determined to leave the drapers shop and become a painter his father said you shall have a yearly allowance of 1200 francs and if you can live on that you can do as you please when his son was made a member of the legion of honour after twentythree years of earnest work his father thought the matter over and presently doubled the allowance for camille seems to have some talent after all he remarked as an excuse for his generosity it is told that when he first went to study in italy corot longed to transfer the moving scenes before him to canvas but people moved too quickly for him so he methodically set about learning how to do with a few strokes what he would otherwise have laboured over so he reduced his sketching to such a science that he became able to sketch a ballet in full movement and it is remarked that this practice trained him for presenting the tremulousness of leaves of trees which he did so exquisitely one learns something of this painter of early dawn and soft evening from a letter he wrote to his friend dupr one gets up at three in the morning before the sun one goes and sits at the foot of a tree one watches and waits one sees nothing much at first nature resembles a

bon there is my picture done in writing those letters corot made literature as well as pictures that little word bing appears also in his paintings as little leaves or bits of treetrunk some small detail which highlightened accents the whole platedance of the nymphs there could hardly be a more charming painting than this which hangs in the louvre it is of a halfshutin landscape of tall trees their branches mingling and all the atmospheric effects that belong to corots work can here be seen on the open greensward is a group of nymphs dancing gaily while over all the scene is the veil of fairyland or of something quite mysterious at the back and side satyrs can be seen watching the nymphs there is here less of the blur of leaves than that seen in later pictures but the same soft effect is found and the little bings are the accents of light placed upon a leaf a nymphs shoulder or a treetrunk this picture was painted in 1851 when corot had not yet developed that style which was to mark all his later work besides this picture he painted paysage the bathers ville darvay willows near arras the bent tree a gust of wind and others xi correggio antonio allegri pronounced corragejyo ahllaygree school of parma 14941534 pupil of mantegna when correggio was a little boy he lived in the odour of spices which were kept upon his fathers shopshelves he was a highlyspiced little boy and man although the most timid and shrinking his imagination was the liveliest possible the spice merchant lived in the town of correggio and thus the artist got his name correggio knew what should be inside the lovely flesh of his painted figures before he began to paint them because he studied anatomy in a truly scientific manner before he studied painting probably no other artist up to that time had ever begun with the bare bones of his models but correggio may be said to have worked from the inside out he learned about the structure of the human frame from dr giovanni battista lombardi and showed his gratitude to his teacher by painting a picture il medico del correggio correggios physician and presenting it to doctor lombardi now correggios childhood or at least his early manhood could not have been spent in poverty because it is known that he used the most expensive colours to paint with painted upon the finest of canvas while greater artists had often to be content with boards he also painted upon copper plates and it is said that he hired begarelli a sculptor of much fame to make models in relief for him to copy for the pictures he painted on the cupolas of the churches in parma that sculptors services must have been expensive on the lovely island of capri in the franciscan convent will be found one of his first pictures painted when correggio was about nineteen years old he was highly original in many ways although he had never seen the work of any great artist he painted the most extraordinary foreshortened pictures and foreshortening was a technicality in art then uncommon he also was the first to paint church cupolas foreshortening produces some peculiar as well as great results and being a feature of art with which people were not then familiar correggios work did not go uncriticised indeed one artist gazing up into one of the cupolas where correggios foreshortened figures were placed remarked that to him it appeared a hash of frogs but when titian saw that cupola he said reverse the cupola fill it with gold and even then that will not be its moneys worth correggio did not receive very large sums for his work and since he was married and took good care of his family he must have had some source of income besides his brush he received some interesting rewards for his paintings for example for st jerome called il giorno he was given 400 gold imperials some cartloads of faggots and measures of wheat and a fat pig that picture is in the parma gallery and all the cupolas which he painted are in parma churches some of his pictures are signed leito a synonym for his name allegri this indicates his style of art there is an interesting story told of how correggio stood entranced before a picture of raphaels and after long study of it he exclaimed i too am a painter showing at once his appreciation of raphaels greatness and satisfaction at his own genius doubtless a good share of correggios comfortable living came from the lady he married since she was considered a rich woman for those times and in that locality her name was girolama merlini and she lived in mantua the place where the montagues and capulets lived of whom shakespeare wrote the most wonderful love story ever imagined this young woman was only sixteen years old when correggio met and loved her and very beautiful and later on he painted a picture zingarella for which his wife is said to have been the model it seems to have been a stroke of economy and enterprise for painters to marry since we read of so many who made fame and fortune through the beauty of their wives they were very happy together correggio and his wife and they had four children their happiness was not for long because correggio seems to have been but thirtyfour years old when she died nor did he live to be old there is a most curious tale of his death which is probably not true but it is worth telling since many have believed it he is supposed to have died in correggio of pleurisy but the story is that he had made a picture for one who had some grudge against him and who in order to irritate him paid him in copper fifty scudi this was a considerable burden and in order to save expense and time it is said that correggio undertook to carry it home alone it was a very hot day and he became so overheated and exhausted with his heavy load that he took ill and died and he may be said literally to have been killed by too much money if this were true vasari a biographer to be generally believed says it is a fact correggio said that he always had his thoughts at the end of his pencil and there are those who impudently declare that is the only place he did have them but that is a carping criticism because he was a very great artist his greatest power being the presentation of soft blendings of light and shade there seem to have been few unusual events in correggios life very little that helps us to judge the man but there is a general opinion that he was a kind and devoted father and husband as well as a good citizen with little demand upon his moral character he did his work did it well and his work alone gave him place and fame he became the head of a school of painting and had many imitators but we hear little of his pupils except that one of them was his own son pompino who lived to be very old and in his turn was successful as an artist correggio was buried with honours in the arrivabene chapel in the franciscan church at correggio platethe holy night this painting is not characteristic of correggios work but nevertheless it is very beautiful the brilliant warm light which comes from the infant jesus in his mothers arms is reflected upon the faces of those gathered about and even illuminates the angelic group hovering above him the slight landscape forming the background is also suggestive and the conditions of the birth are indicated by the ass which may be seen in the middle distance the faces of all are joyous yet full of wonderment the whole scene intimate and human the picture is also called the adoration of the shepherds and that title best tells the story see the shepherdess shading her face with one hand and offering two turtledoves with the other the ass in the distance is the one on which mary rode to bethlehem and joseph is caring for it even the cold light of the dawning day is softened by the beauty of the group below this picture is in the royal gallery in dresden platethe mystic marriage of st catherine the infant jesus sits upon his mothers lap and places the ring upon st catherines finger while marys hand helps to guide that of her child this action brings the three hands close together and adds to the beauty of the composition all of the faces are full of pleasure and kindliness while that of st sebastian fairly glows with happy emotion the light is concentrated upon the body of the child and is reflected upon the faces of the women this painting hangs in the louvre other great correggio pictures are the school of cupid which is more characteristic of his work antiope leda danae and ecce homo xii paul gustave dore french school 18331883 this artist died in paris twentyfive years ago but there is little as yet to be told of his life history he was educated in paris at the lyce charlemagne having gone there from strasburg where he was born he was a painter of fantastic and grotesque subjects and as far as we know he began his career when a boy he made sketches before his eighth year which attracted much attention and he earned considerable money while still at school he was at that time engaged to illustrate for journals at a good round sum and before he left the lyce he had made hundreds of drawings somewhat after the satirical fashion of hogarth his work is very characteristic and once seen is likely to be always recognised he first worked for the journal pour rire but then he undertook to illustrate the work of rabelais the great satirist whose text just suited dors pencil after rabelais he illustrated balzac also the wandering jew don quixote and dantes divine comedy he undertook to do things which he could not do well simply for the money there was in the commissions he had but a poor idea of colour and his work was coarse but it had such marked peculiarities that it became famous he did a little sculpture as well and even that showed his eccentricities of thought platemoses breaking the tablets of the law this is one of the illustrations of the dor bible published in 186566 the story is well known of how moses went up into the mount of the lord to receive the laws for the israelites which were written upon tables of stone upon his descent from the mount he found that his followers had set up a golden calf which they were worshipping and in his wrath moses broke the tablets on which the law was inscribed the power shown in his attitude the affrighted faces of the cowering jews the thunder and lightning as an expression of the wrath of the almighty are all painted in dors best manner xiii albrecht drer pronounced dooerrer nuremberg school 14711528 pupil of wolgemuth and schongauer albrecht drer by nationality was a hungarian but he was born in the city of nuremberg his father had come from the little hungarian town of eytas to nuremberg that he might practise the craft of a goldsmith notwithstanding his hungarian origin the name is german and the family bearing or sign is the open door this device suggests that the name was first formed from thurer which means carpenter maker of doors the father became the goldworker for a master goldsmith of nuremberg named hieronymus holper and very soon the new employee had fallen in love with his masters daughter the daughter was very young and very beautiful her name was barbara and as herr drer was quite forty years of age while she was but fifteen the match seemed most unlikely but they married and had eighteen children the great painter was one of them albrecht loved his parents most tenderly and from first to last we hear no word of disagreement among any members of that immense household young albrecht was especially the companion of his father being brilliant generous and hardworking in a family where everyone needed to do his best to help along this love and companionship never ceased until death and after his parents died albrecht wrote in a touching manner of their death describing his love for them and their many virtues he was an author and a poet as well as a painter and only leonardo da vinci matched him for greatness and versatility we may know what drers father looked like since the son made two portraits of him one is to be seen in the uffizi gallery at florence and the other belongs to the duke of northumberlands collection the latter portrait has been reproduced in an engraving so that it is familiar to most people in the days when the great artist was growing up nuremberg was the centre of all intellectuality and art in the north the city of augsburg also followed art fashions but it was far less important than nuremberg because in the latter city every sort of artcraft was followed in sincerity and with great originality in those days the craft of the goldsmith was closely allied with the profession of the painter because the smith had to create his own designs and that called for much talent thus it was but a step from designing in precious metals to the use of colour and to engraving in making wood engravings however the drudgery of it was left almost entirely to workmen not artists nuremberg was also the seat of musical learning wagner makes this fact pathetic comical and altogether charming in his mastersingers of nuremberg till drers time however there had been little painting that could be regarded as art and when he came to study it there was but little opportunity in his own land but drer was destined to bring art to nuremberg if he went elsewhere to study it was only for a little time because he was above all things patriotic and dearly loved his home with seventeen brothers and sisters young drers problem was a serious one his father not only meant him to become a goldsmith like himselfa craft in which there was much money to be made at a time when people dressed with great ornamentation and used gold to decorate withit was highly necessary with so large a family that he should learn to do that which could make him helpful to his father hence the young boy entered his fathers shop if he had not been handicapped with so many to help to maintain he would have laid up a considerable fortune because from the very beginning he was master of all that he undertook doing the least thing better than any other did it putting conscience and painstaking into all my father took special delight in me the son said seeing that i was industrious in working and learning he put me to school and when i had learned to read and write he took me home from my school and taught me the goldsmiths trade the family were good and kind excellent neighbours deeply religious and little albrecht certainly was comely he was beautiful as a little child and as a man was very handsome with long light hair sweeping his shoulders and gentle eyes he was very tall stately and full of dignity in his fathers shop he made little clay figures which were afterward moulded in metal also he learned to carve wood and ivory and he added the touch of originality to all that he did he was the leonardo da vinci of germany an intellectual man a poet painter sculptor engraver and engineer he approached everything that he did from an intellectual point of view looking for the reasons of things after a while in his fathers shop he found mere craftsmanship irksome and he begged to be allowed to enter a studio this was a great disappointment to the father even a distress because he could see no very quick nor large returns in money for an artist and he sorely needed the help of his son but being kind and reasonable he consented albrecht was apprenticed to the only artist of any repute then in nuremberg wolgemuth to his studio albrecht went at the age of fifteen and if he did not learn much more of painting under that artists direction than his own genius had already taught him he learned the drudgery of his work how to grind colours and to mix them and he studied wood engraving also in wolgemuths studio he remained for the three years of his apprenticeship and then he fled to better things for a time he followed the methods of another german artist schongauer but finally he went forth to try his luck alone he wandered from place to place practising all his trades goldsmithing engraving whatever would support him yet always and everywhere painting it is thought that he may have gone as far as italy but it is not certain whether he went there in his first wanderings or later on however he was soon recalled home for his father had found a suitable wife for him she was the daughter of a rich citizen and her name was agnes frey she was pretty as well as rich but had she been neither albrecht would have returned at his fathers bidding there was never any resistance to the fine and proper things of life on albrecht drers part he was the well balanced reasonable man from youth up there have been extraordinary tales told of the artists wife she has been called hateful and spiteful as xantippe the wife of socrates but we think this is calumny the stories came about in this way drer had a lifelong friend wilibald pirkheimer who in his old age became the most malicious and quarrelsome of old fellows he lived longer than drer did and drers wife also outlived her husband pirkheimer wanted a set of antlers which had belonged to drer and which he thought the wife should give him after drer was dead but agnes thought otherwise and would not give them up then full of rage the old man wrote the most outrageous letters about poor agnes saying that she was a shrew and had compelled drer to work himself to death that she was a miser and had led the artist an awful dance through life this is the only evidence against her and that so sane and sensible a man as the artist lived with her all his life and cherished her is evidence enough that pirkheimer didnt tell the truth when drer died he was in good circumstances and instead of being overworked he for many years had done no potboiling but had followed investigations along lines that pleased him after his death the widow treated his brothers and sisters generously giving them properties of drers and being of much help to them during the artists life he and she had travelled everywhere together and had appeared to love each other tenderly hence we may conclude that the old pirkheimer was simply a disgruntled gouty old man without a good word for anybody if drers father and mother had eighteen children albrecht and agnes struck a balance for they had none whether or not drer went to italy before his marriage in 1494 certain it is that he was in venice the home of titian in 1506 titian was six years younger than drer who was then about thirtyfive years old it is said that he started for italy in 1505 and that he went the whole of the way over the alps through forests and streams on horseback who knows but it was during that very journey while travelling alone often finding himself in lonely ways and full of the speculative thoughts that were characteristic of him that he did not think first of his subject knight death and the devil which helped make his fame in that picture we have a knight helmeted carrying his lance mounted upon his horse riding in a lonely forest with death upon a pale horse by his side holding an hour glass to remind the knight of the fleeting of time behind comes the devil with trident and horn represented as a frightful and disgusting beast which follows hotfoot after the lonely knight who looks neither to right nor left but persistently goes his way titians teacher bellini was still living and he was one of drers greatest admirers especially did he believe that he could paint the finest hair of any artist in the world one day while studying drers work and being especially fascinated by the hair of one of his figures the old man took drers brush and tried to reproduce as beautiful a tress presently he put down the brush in despair but the younger artist took it up still wet with the same colours and in a few brilliant strokes produced a lovely lock of womans hair while luxuriating in venetian heat drer wrote home to his friend pirkheimer oh how i shall freeze after this sunshine he was a lover of warm beautiful colour gay and tender life most of all he loved the fatherland and all the honours paid him and all the invitations pressed upon him could not keep him long from nuremberg the journey homeward was not uneventful because he was taken ill and had to stop at a house on his way where he was cared for till he was strong enough to proceed before he went his way he painted upon the wall of that house a fine picture to show his gratitude for the kind treatment he had received imagine a people so settled in their homes that it would be worth while for an artist who came along to leave a picture upon the walls todaywe should have moved to a new house or a new flat almost before drer could have washed his brushes and turned the corner back in nuremberg he settled down into the life of a responsible citizen lived in a fine new house in time became a member of the council and his studio was a veritable workshop studios were quite different from those of today then the pupils turned to and ground colours did much of their own manufacturing engaged at first in such commonplace occupations which were nevertheless teaching them the foundation of their art while they watched the work of the master such a studio as drers must have been full of young men coming and going not all working at the art of painting but engraving preparing materials for such work designing and executing many other details of art work after this time drer made his smallest picture which is hardly more than an inch in diameter on that tiny surface he painted the whole story of the crucifixion and it is now in the dresden gallery to those of us who see little mentality in the faces of the italian subjects the german art of drer often ugly in the choice of models and so exact as to bring out unpleasing details is nevertheless the greater because in all cases the faces have sincere expressions they exhibit human purposes and emotions which we can understand and despise or love as the case may be they say that his madonna is generally a muchdressed roundfaced german mother holding a merry little german boy that may be true but at any rate she is every inch a mother and he a wellbeloved little boy which is considerably more than can be said of some italian performances drer made a painting of praying hands a queer subject for a picture but those hands are nothing but praying hands the story of them is touching it is said that for several years drer had won a prize for which a friend of his had also competed and upon losing the prize the last time he tried for it the friend raised his hands and prayed for the power to accept his failure with resignation and humility drer looking at him was impressed with the eloquence of the gesture thus the praying hands was conceived drer was also called the father of picture books because he designed so many woodcuts that he first made possible the illustration of stories he printed his own illustrations in his own house and was well paid for it the emperor maximillian visited nuremberg and wishing to honour drer commanded him to make a triumphal arch it was not to be fashioned in stone like the arches given to the victorious roman emperors but instead it was to be composed of engravings drer made for this purpose ninetytwo separate blocks of woodcuts on these were represented maximillians genealogical tree and the principal events of his life all these were arranged in the form of an arch 9 feet wide and 1012 feet high it took drer three years to do this work and he was never well paid so says one who has compiled many incidents of his life while the artist worked the emperor often visited his studio and as drers pet cats often visited it at the same time the expression arose a cat may look at a king on the occasion of one of these kingly visits maximillian tried to do a little artwork on his own account taking a piece of charcoal he tried to sketch but the charcoal kept breaking and he asked drer why it did so that is my sceptre your majesty has other and greater work to do was the tactful reply it is a question with us today whether the king ever did a greater work than albrecht drer king of painters was doing after this maximillian gave drer a pension but when the emperor died the artist found it necessary to apply to the monarch who came after him in order to have the gift confirmed this was the occasion for his journey to the low countries and he took his wife agnes with him in the netherlands he was received with much honour and was invited to become court painter and what was more his pension was fixed upon him for life the great work of his life was his illustration of the apocalypse for this he made sixteen extraordinary woodcuts of great size on his journey to see charles v maximillians successor drer kept a diary in which he noted the minutest details of all that happened to him he told of the coronation of charles of hearing about a whale that had been cast upon the shore of his disappointment that it had been removed before he had reached the place he wrote with great indignation about the supposed kidnapping of martin luther while he was on his way home from the diet of worms while drer was in the low countries a fever came upon him and when he returned home it still followed him indeed although he lived for seven years after his return he was never well again among his effects there was a sketch made to indicate to his physician the seat of his illness drer did not paint great frescoes upon walls as did raphael michael angelo and all great italian artists but instead he painted on wood canvas and in oils in all the civilised world drer was honoured equally with the great italian painters of his time he was a man of much conscientiousness dignity and tenderness he was devoted to his home and country and regarded the problems of life intellectually when he came to die his end was so unexpected that those dearest to him could not reach his bedside he was buried in st johns cemetery in nuremberg after his death martin luther wrote as follows to their mutual friend eoban hesse as for drer assuredly affection bids us mourn for one who was the best of men yet you may well hold him happy that he has made so good an end and that christ has taken him from the midst of this time of troubles and from yet greater troubles in store lest he that deserved to behold nothing but the best should be compelled to behold the worst therefore may he rest in peace with his fathers amen platethe nativity our description of this painting calls attention to the fact that the columns and arches of the picturesque ruin belong to a much later period in history than the birth of christ drer was not acquainted with any earlier style of architecture than the romanesque and therefore he used it here the ruin serves as a stable a roof of board is built out in front of the sideroom which shelters the ox and ass and under this leanto lies the new born babe surrounded by angels who express their childish joy mary kneels and contemplates her child with glad emotion joseph also deeply moved kneels down on the other side of the child outside the shelter of the roof some shepherds to whom the angel who is still seen hovering in the air has announced the tidings are already entering from without the walls knackfuss the picture is the central panel of an altarpiece now in the old pinakothek at munich drers oil painting of the four apostlesjohn peter mark and paulis in the same gallery other drer pictures are the knight death and the devil the adoration of the magi melancholy and portraits of himself xiv mariano fortuny pronounced mahreeahno fortune spanish school 18381874 pupil of claudio lorenzalez fortuny won his own opportunities he took a prize while still very young which made it possible for him to go to rome where he wished to study art he did not spend his time studying and copying the old masters as did most artists who went there but instead he studied the life of the roman streets he had already been at the academy of barcelona but he did not follow his first master instead he struck out a line of art for himself after a year in rome the artist went to war but he did not go to fight men he was still fighting fate and his weapon was his sketch book he went with general prim and he filled his book with warlike scenes and the brilliant skies of morocco from that time his work was inspired by his moorish experiences after going to war without becoming a soldier fortuny returned to paris and there he became fast friends with meissonier so that a good deal of his work was influenced by that artists genius after a time fortunys paintings came into great vogue and faroff americans began buying them as well as europeans there was a certain rich drygoods merchant in the united states who had made a large fortune for those days and while he knew nothing about art he wanted to spend his money for fine things so he employed people who did understand the matter to buy for him many pictures whose excellence he himself could not understand but which were to become a fine possession for succeeding generations this was about 1860 and this man at stewart bought two of fortunys pictures at high prices the serpent charmer and a fantasy of morocco when fortuny was thirty years old he married the daughter of a spaniard called madrazo director of the royal museum his wifes family had several well known artists in it and the marriage was a very happy one because of this fortuny was inspired to paint one of the greatest of his pictures the spanish marriage in it are to be seen the portraits of his wife and his friend regnault after a time he went to live in granada but he could never forget the beautiful barbaric scenes in morocco and so he returned there afterward he went with his wife to live in rome and there they had a fine home and everything exquisite about them while fortune and favour showered upon them but he fell ill with roman fever because of working in the open air and he died while he was comparatively a young man platethe spanish marriage fortuny is said to split the light into a thousand particles till his pictures sparkle like jewels and are as brilliant as a kaleidoscope he set the fashion for a class of pictures filled with silks and satins bricbrac and elegant trifling look at the brilliant scene in this picture the priest rising from his chair and leaning over the table is watching the bridegroom sign his name this chap is an old fop bedecked in lilac satin while the bride is a dainty young woman without much interest in her husband for she is fingering her beautiful fan and gossiping with one of her girl friends she wears orangeblossoms in her black hair and is in full bridal array one couple two men sit on an elegantly carved seat and are looking at the goingson with amusement while an old gentleman sits quite apart disgusted with the whole unimpressive scene everybody is trifling and no one is serious for the occasion the furnishings of the room are beautiful delicate almost frivolous people are strewn about like flowers and the whole effect is airy and inconsequent fortuny painted also the praying arab a fantasy of morocco snake charmers camels at rest etc xv thomas gainsborough english school 17271788 pupil of gravelot and of hayman there seems to have been no artist with the extraordinary exceptions of drer and leonardo who learned his lessons while at school little painters have uniformly begun as bad spellers gainsboroughs father was in the business of woolencrape making while his mother painted flowers very nicely and it was she who taught the small thomas there were nine little gainsboroughs and shocking to relate the artist of the family was so ready with his pencil that when he was ten years old he forged his fathers name to a note which he took to the schoolmaster and thereby gained himself a holiday there is no account of any other wicked use to which he put his talent it is said that he could copy any writing that he saw and his ready pencil covered all his copybooks with sketches of his schoolmasters it was thought better for him finally to follow his own ideas of education namely to roam the woodlands and make beautiful pictures his fathers heart was not softened till one day little gainsborough brought home a sketch of the orchard into which the head of a man had thrust itself painted with great ability this man was a poacher and father gainsborough recognised him by the portrait there seemed to be utility in art of this kind and before long the boy found himself apprenticed to a silversmith through the silversmith the artist got admission to an art school and began his studies but his master was a dissolute fellow and before long the pupil left him gainsborough was born in the town of sudbury on the river stour the same which inspired another great painter half a century later gainsborough is best known by his portraits in particular as the inventor of the gainsborough hat but he was first of all a truly great landscape painter and learned his art as constable did after him along the beautiful shores of the river that flowed past his native town the old black horse inn is still to be seen and it was in the orchard behind it that he studied nature the same in which he made the first of his famous portraits that of the poacher it is known to this day as the portrait of tom peartree that picture was copied on a piece of wood cut into the shape of a man and it is in the possession of mr jackson who lent it for the exhibition of gainsboroughs work held at the grosvenor gallery in 1885 while thomas was with his first master by no means a good companion for a lad of fifteen he lived a busy selfrespecting life since he was devoted to his home and to his parents only three years after he set out to learn his art he married a young lady of sudbury the pair were by no means rich gainsborough having only eighteen years of experience in this world besides his brush and a maker of woolencrape shrouds for a fatherwho was not over pleased to have an artist for a son the lady had two hundred pounds but this did not promise a very luxurious living so they took a house for six pounds a year at ipswich thus the two young lovers began their life together there was a good deal of romance in the story of his wife whose name was supposed to be margaret burr the two hundred pounds that helped to pay the ipswich rent did not come from the man accepted as her father but from her real father who was either the duke of bedford or an exiled prince this would seem to be just the sort of story that should surround a great painter and his affairs while he lived at ipswich gainsborough used to say of himself that he was chiefly in the faceway meaning that for the most part he made portraits he loved best to paint the scenes of his boyhood as constable afterward did but he soon found there was more money in portraits and so he decided to go to live in bath the fashionable resort of english people in that day where he was likely to find rich folk who wanted to see themselves on canvas he settled down there with his wife whom he loved dearly and his two daughters and at once began to make money it is said he painted five hours a day and all the rest of the time studied music as the theatre was corots greatest happiness so did music most delight gainsborough and he could play well on nearly every known instrument he became so excellent a musician that he even gave concerts he had the most delightful people about him people who loved art and who appreciated him and then there were the other people who paid for having themselves painted altogether it was an ideal situation his studio was in the place known as the circus at bath and people came and went all day for it became the fashionable resort for all the fine folks from five guineas for half length portraits he soon raised his price to forty he had charged eight for full length portraits but now they went for one hundred he painted some famous men of the time the very thought is inspiring of such a company of geniuses with gainsborough in the centre of the group he painted laurence sterne who wrote the sentimental journey and a few other delightful things also garrick the renowned actor even the encyclopdia reads thrillingly upon this subject and one can afford to quote it with the feeling that the quotation will be read his house harboured italian german french and english musicians he haunted the green room of palmers theatre and painted gratuitously the portraits of many of the actors he gave away his sketches and landscapes to any one who had taste or assurance enough to ask for them this sounds royal and exciting after that gainsborough went up to london with plenty of money and plenty of confidence and instead of six pounds a year for his house he paid three hundred pounds which suggests much more comfort there were two other great painters of the time in london sir benjamin westan american by the wayand sir joshua reynolds west was court favourite but gainsborough too was called upon to paint royalty and share wests honours reynolds was the favourite of the town but he too had to divide honours with gainsborough when the latter painted richard brinsley sheridan edmund burke and sir william blackstone notwithstanding his landscapes for which he should have been most famous did not sell everybody approved of them but it is said they were returned to him till they stood ranged in long lines from his hall to his painting room gainsborough was a member of the royal academy and also a true bohemian he cared little for elegant society but made his friends among men of genius of all sorts he was very handsome and impulsive tall and fair and generous in his ways but he had much sorrow on account of one of his daughters mary who married fischer a hautboy player against her fathers wishes the girl became dementedat least she had spells of madness when mary gainsborough married her father wrote the following letter to his sister which shows that he was a man of tender feeling for those whom he truly loved i had not the least suspicion of the attachment being so long and deeply seated and as it was too late for me to alter anything without being the cause of total unhappiness on both sides my consent i needs must give and accordingly they were married last monday and settled for the present in a readyfurnished little house in curzon street mayfair i cant say i have any reason to doubt the mans honesty or goodness of heart as i never heard anyone speak anything amiss of him and as to his oddities and temper she must learn to like them as she likes his person peggy has been very unhappy about it but i endeavour to comfort her peggy was his wife the abominable fischer died twentyyears before mary didshe lived to be an old old woman among those whom gainsborough loved best was the man called wiltshire who carried his pictures to and from london he was a public carrier but would never take any money for his services to the artist because he loved his work all he asked was a little pictureand he got so many of these given in purest affection that he might have gone out of business as a carrier had he chosen to sell them four of those little pictures are now very great ones worth thousands of pounds and known everywhere to fame they are the parish clerk portrait of quin a landscape with cattle and the harvest waggon we have a good many stories of gainsboroughs bad manners the artists of his day tried to treat him with every consideration but in return he treated them very badly especially sir joshua reynolds reynolds who was then president of the academy greatly admired gainsborough but the latter would not return sir joshuas call and when reynolds asked him to paint his portrait for him gainsborough undertook it thanklessly sir joshua left town for bath for a time and when he returned he tried to learn how soon the portrait would be finished but gainsborough would not even reply to his inquiry there seems to have been no reason for this behaviour unless it was jealousy but it made a most uncomfortable situation between fellow artists gainsborough has told some not very pleasing stories about himself but one of them shows us what a knack he had for seeing the comic side of things and perhaps for seeing comedy where it never existed upon one occasion he was invited to a friends house where the family were in the habit of assembling for prayers and he had no sooner got inside than he began to fear he should laugh when prayer time came at the chaplain in a rush of shyness he fled leaving his host to look for him till he stumbled over a servant who said that mr gainsborough had charged him to say he had gone to breakfast at salisbury even respect for the customs of others could not make him control himself it was through his intimacy with king georges family that his quarrel with the royal academy came about he had painted the three princessesthe princess royal princesses augusta and elizabeth and these were to be hung at a certain height in carlton house but when he sent the first to the academy he asked it to be specially hung and his request was refused then he sent a note as follows he begs pardon for giving them so much trouble but he has painted the picture of the princesses in so tender a light that notwithstanding he approves very much of the established line for strong effects he cannot possibly consent to have it placed higher than eight feet and a half because the likeness and the work of the picture will not be seen any higher therefore at a word he will not trouble the gentlemen against their inclination but will beg the best of his pictures back again immediately the academy returned his pictures although it would seem that they might better have accommodated gainsborough than have lost such a fine exhibition he never again would send anything to them he was inclined to be irritated by inartistic points in his sitters and is said to have muttered when he was painting the portrait of mrs siddons the great actress damn your nose madam there is no end to it the nose in question must have been an eyesore to more than gainsborough for a famous critic is said to have declared that mrs siddons with all her beauty was a kind of female johnson her nose was not too long for nothing notwithstanding that his landscapes were not popular he used to go off into the country to indulge his taste for painting them and once he wrote to a friend that he meant to mount all the lakes at the next exhibition in the great style and you know if people dont like them its only jumping into one of the deepest of them from off a wooded island and my reputation will be fixed forever an old lady whose guest he was down in the country told how he was gay very gay and good looking creating a great sensation in a rich suit of drab with laced ruffles and cocked hat one of the boys he saw in the country he delighted to paint and he also grew so much attached to him that he took him to london and kept him with him as his own son that boys name was jack hill and he did not care for city life nor maybe for gainsboroughs eccentricities so he ran away he was found again and again till one day he got away for good and never came back all his later life gainsborough was happy his daughter who had married fischer the hautboyplayer came back home to live and her disorder was not bad enough to prevent her being a cause of great happiness to her father the other daughter never married gainsborough says that he spent a thousand pounds a year but he also gave to everybody who asked of him and to many who asked nothing so that he must have made a great deal of money during his lifetime by his art it is said that the boy at the stile was bestowed on colonel hamilton for his fine playing of a solo on the violin a lady who had done the artist some trifling service received twenty drawings as a reward which she pasted on the walls of her rooms without the slightest idea of their value gainsborough got up early in the morning but did not work more than five hours he liked his friends his music and his wife and spent much time with them he was witty and while he sketched pictures in the evening with his wife and daughters at his side he kept them laughing with his droll sayings the last days of gainsborough showed him to be a hero he died of cancer and some time before he knew what his disease was he must have suffered a great deal there is a story that is very pathetic of a dinner with his friends beaumont and sheridan usually he was the gayest of the gay but of late all his friends had noticed that gaiety came to him with effort upon the night of this dinner sheridan had been his wittiest and had tried his hardest to make gainsborough cheer up till finally the artist finding it impossible to get out of his sad mood asked sheridan if he would leave the table and speak with him alone the two friends went out together now dont laugh but listen gainsborough said i shall soon die i know it i feel it i have less time to live than my looks infer but i do not fear death what oppresses my mind is this i have many acquaintances few friends and as i wish to have one worthy man to accompany me to the grave i am desirous of bespeaking you will you come aye or no at that sheridan who was greatly shocked tried to cheer him but gainsborough would not return to the table till he got the promise which of course sheridan made it was not very long after this that a famous trial took placethat of warren hastings it was in westminster hall and gainsborough went to listen several times on the last occasion he became so interested in what was happening that he did not notice a window open at his back after a little he said to a friend that he felt something inexpressibly cold touch his neck on his return home he told of the strange feeling to his wife then he sent for a doctor and there was found a little swelling the doctor said it was not serious and that when the weather grew warmer it would disappear but all the while gainsborough felt certain that it would mean his death a short time after that he told his sister that he knew himself to have a cancer and that was true when he felt that he must die he fell to thinking of many things in the past and wished to right certain mistakes of his behaviour as far as possible he sent to sir joshua reynolds and asked him to come and see him since he could not go to see sir joshua reynolds went and then gainsborough told him of his regret that he had shown so much illwill and jealousy toward so great and worthy a rival reynolds was very generous and tried to make gainsborough understand that all was forgiven and forgotten he left his brother artist much relieved and happier and he afterward said the impression on my mind was that his regret at losing life was principally the regret of leaving his art as reynolds left the dying mans room gainsborough called after him we are all going to heavenand van dyck is of the company he was buried in kew churchyard and the ceremonies were followed by reynolds and five of the royal academicians who forgot all gainsboroughs eccentricities of conduct toward them in their honest grief over his death he was one of the first three dozen original members of the royal academy plateportrait of mrs richard brinsley sheridan this picture is now in the collection of lord rothschild london mrs sheridan was the loveliest lady of her time she was the daughter of thomas linley and a singer she came from a home which was called a nest of nightingales because all in it were musicians the father had a large family and made up his mind to become the best musician of his time in his locality in order to support them he was successful and in turn most of his children became musicians his lovely daughter eliza mrs sheridan he bound to himself as an apprentice and taught her till she was twentyone insisting that she serve out her time to him that she might become a perfect singer the story of this beautiful lady seems to belong to the story of gainsboroughs portrait and shall be told here when she was a very little girl no more than eight years old she was so beautiful that as she stood at the door of the pump room in bath to sell tickets for her fathers concerts everyone bought them from her when she was a very young woman her father engaged her to marry a mr long sixty years old she did not seem to mind what arrangements her father made for her but continued to sing and attend to her business till after the wedding gowns were all made and everything ready for the marriage when she happened to meet the brilliant richard brinsley sheridan whose plays were so fashionable and she fell deeply in love with him she told mr long she would not marry him and without much objection he gave her up but her father was very angry and he threatened to sue mr long for letting his daughter go then the beautiful lady ran away to calais and married mr sheridan without her fathers permission but she came home again and said nothing of what she had done kept on singing and helping her father earn money for his family one day mr sheridan was wounded in a duel which he had fought with one of his wifes admirers and when she heard the news she screamed my husband my husband so that everybody knew she was married to the fascinating playwright sheridan for some reason did not at once come and get her nor arrange for them to have a home together for a good while she continued to sing and once hearing her in oratorio sheridan fell in love with his wife all over again he took her from her home and would never let her sing again in public they remarried publicly and went to live in london he was not at all a rich and famous man at that timeonly a poor lawstudentbut he would not let his wife make the fortune she might easily have made by singing this must have made his beautiful wife very sad but she made no complaint at giving up her music and letting him silence her lovely voice but turned all her attention to advancing his fortunes she worked for him even harder than she had for her father and that was saying a great deal when he became a great writer of plays his wife took charge of all the accounts of his drury lane theatre and when he was in the house of commons she acted as his secretary sheridan died in great poverty and wretchedness and it is believed had his selfsacrificing wife not died before him she would have looked after his affairs so well that he would not have lost his fortune gainsborough painted the portraits of sheridans fatherinlaw and of samuel linley and it was said that this last portrait was painted in fortyeight minutes among his other portraits are eight of george iii sir john skynner admiral hood colonel st leger and the blue boy but he was first and last a landscape painter of highest genius xvi jean leon gerome pronounced zhahn layon zhayrome french semiclassical school 18241904 pupil of delaroche one cannot write much more than the date of birth and death of a man who lived until three or four years of the time of writing so we may only say that grme was one of the most brilliant of modern french painters he was born at vesoul and his father was a goldsmith thus he probably had no very great difficulty in getting a start in his work the prejudice against having an artist in the family was dying out and as a prosperous goldsmith we may believe that his father had means enough to give his son good opportunities grme like millet studied under delaroche but became no such characteristic painter as he while studying with delaroche he also was taking the course in lecole des beauxarts his first exhibited picture was the cock fight and he won a third class medal by it almost always this painter has chosen his subjects from ancient or classic life and his pictures are not always decent but he painted with much care the details of his work are very finely done and their vivid colour is fascinating platethe sword dance this painting may be seen in the metropolitan museum of art in new york city the scene is full of action and interest but perhaps the details of dress mosaic decoration upon the walls patterns of the rugs the coloured and jewelled lamps and windows are the most splendidly painted of all the central figure is a dancing girl only partly draped balancing a sword on her head while a brilliant green veil flies from head and face other oriental women squat upon the floor watching her with a half indolent expression while their oriental masters and their friends sit in pomp at one side absorbed in the dance and in the girl the expressions upon all the faces are excellent and the jewelled light that falls upon the group the rich clothing the grace of the dancerall make a fascinating picture of a genre type other grmes are daphnis and chloe leda and the duel after the masked ball xvii ghirlandajo pronounced geerlandayo florentine school 14491494 pupil of fra bartolommeo it is a good deal of a namedomenico di tommaso di currado bigordiand it would appear that the child who bore it was under obligation to become a good deal of a something before he died italian and spanish painters generally had large names to live up to and the one known as ghirlandajo did nobly his father was a goldsmith and a popular part of his work was the making of golden garlands for the hair of rich italian ladies his work was so beautiful that it gained for him the name of ghirlandajo meaning the garlandtwiner a name that lived after him in the great art of his son domenico began as a worker in mosaic a maker of pictures or designs with many coloured pieces of glass or stone ghirlandajos art was no improvement on that of his teacher but he in turn became the teacher of michael angelo the florentine school of painting to which ghirlandajo belonged was not so famous for colour as the venetian school but it had many other elements to commend it one cannot expect ghirlandajo to rank with titian rubens or other colourists of his own and later periods but he did the very best work of his day and school he attained to fame through his choice of types of faces for his models and by his excellent grouping of figures until his day the faces introduced into paintings were likely to be unattractive but he chose pleasing ones and he painted the folds of garments beautifully he was not entirely original in his ideas but he carried out those which others had thus far failed to make interesting often in his wish to paint exactly what he saw he softened nothing and therefore his figures were repulsive but fra bartolommeos pupil gave promise of what michael angelo was to fulfill ghirlandajo and michael angelo were a good deal alike in their emotional natures both sought great spaces in which to paint and both chose to paint great frescoes indeed ghirlandajo had the extraordinary ambition to put frescoes on all the fortification walls about florence it certainly would have made the city a great picture gallery to have had its walls forever hung with the pictures of one master had he painted them inside and out when such an enemy as napoleon came along with his love of art and his fashion of taking all that he saw to paris he would likely enough have camped outside the walls while he decided what part of the gallery he would transfer to the louvre one of the reasons that ghirlandajo is famous is that he often chose well known personages for his models and as he painted just what he saw did not idealise his subject he gave to the world amazing portraits as well as fine paintings the same thing was done by painters of a far different school at another period the dutch and flemish painters were in the habit of using their neighbours as models ghirlandajo is classed among religious painters but let us compare some of his religious paintings with those of raphael or murillo and see the result he painted seven frescos on the walls of the santa maria novella in florence all scenes of biblical history as ghirlandajo imagined them they show him to have been a fine artist but to have had not much idea of history and to have had little sense of fitness ghirlandajos seven subjects are taken from legends of the virgin and the greatest represents marys visit to elizabeth it is called the visitation and it is a fresco about eighteen feet long painted on the choir wall let us imagine the possible scene the virgin mary came from cana a little town in galilee placed in the hills about nine miles from nazareth the home of the lowliest and the poorest of a kindly pastoral people living in the open air needing and wanting very little simple in their habits elizabeth marys old cousin lived in judea and st luke writes thus mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judea and entered into the house of zacharias elizabeths husband and saluted elizabeth this record had been made at least eleven hundred years before ghirlandajo painted in the santa maria novella and from it one cannot imagine that mary made any preparation for her journey nor does it suggest that elizabeth had any chance to arrange a reception for her even had she done so it must have been of the simplest description at that time among those people one can imagine a lowly home an aged woman coming out to meet her young relative either at her door or in the high road there may have been surroundings of fruit and flowers a stretch of highroad or a hospitable doorway but the wildest imagination could not picture what ghirlandajo did he paints elizabeth flanked with handmaidens as if she were some royal personage instead of a priests wife in fairly comfortable circumstances where comfort was easily obtained mary appears to be escorted by ladiesinwaiting hardly a likely circumstance since she was affianced to no richer or more important person than a carpenter of galilee possibly the three ladies that stand behind mary in the picture are merely lookerson but in that case the visit of mary would seem to have been of public importance especially as there are youths near by who are also much interested in one womans hasty visit to another the rich brocades worn by elizabeths waiting ladies are splendid indeed and the landscape is finea rich italian landscape with architecture of the most uptodate sortshowing in short that the artist lacked historical imagination he found some models made a purely decorative painting with an italian setting and called it the visitation the doorway on the right is distinctly renaissance such a painting as this is not religious nor is it historic nor does it suggest a subject it is merely a fine picture better coloured than most of those of the florentine school there is another painting of this same subject by ghirlandajo in the louvre but it is no nearer truth than the one in the santa maria ghirlandajo painted other than religious subjects and one of them at least is quite repulsive it is the picture of an old man with a beautiful little child embracing him the old man may have tenderness and love in his face but his heavy features his warty nose do not make one think of pleasant things and one does not care to imagine the dear little child kissing the grotesque old fellow it was before ghirlandajos time that another painter had discovered the use of oil in mixing paints previously colours had been mixed in water with some gelatinous substance such as the white and yolk of an egg to give the paint a proper texture or consistency this preparation was called distemper and frescoes were made by using this upon plaster while it was still wet plaster and colours dried together and the painting became a part of the wall not to be removed except by taking the plaster with it the different gluey substances used had often the effect of making the colours lose their tone and they presented a glazed surface when used upon wood a favourite material with artists there are numberless anecdotes written of this artist and his brother and one of these shows he had a temper the brothers were engaged in a monastery at passignano painting a picture of the last supper while at work upon it they lived in the house the coarse fare did not suit ghirlandajo and one night he could endure it no longer springing from his seat in the refectory he flung the soup all over the monk who had served it and taking a great loaf of bread he beat him with it so hard that the poor monk was carried to his cell nearly dead the abbot had gone to bed but hearing the rumpus he thought it was nothing less than the roof falling in and he hurried to the room where he found the brothers still raging over their dinner david shouted out to him when the abbot tried to reprove the artist that his brother was worth more than any pig of an abbot who ever lived it is recorded in the documents found in the confraternity of st paul that domenico de ghurrado bighordi painter called del grillandaio died on saturday morning on the 11th day of january 1493 os of a pestilential fever and the overseers allowed no one to see the dead man and would not have him buried by day so he was buried in santa maria novella on saturday night after sunset and may god forgive him this was a very great loss for he was highly esteemed for his many qualities and is universally lamented the artist left nine children behind him ghirlandajos pictures may be found in the louvre the berlin museum the dresden munich and london galleries most children will find it hard to see their beauty great men are likely to come in groups and with ghirlandajo there are associated botticelli and fra filippo lippi plateportrait of giovanna degli albizi this lovely lady was the wife of one of the painters patrons giovanni tornabuoni through whom he received the commission for a series of frescoes in the choir of the santa maria novella florence the subjects chosen were sacred but since ghirlandajo no more than his neighbours knew what the virgin or her contemporaries looked like he saw no reason why he should not compliment some of the great ones of his own city and his own time by painting them in to represent the different characters of holy writ so as one of the ladies attendant upon elizabeth when mary comes to visit her we have this signora of the fifteenth century the artist made another picture of her the one here shown but in the same dress and posed the same as she had been for the church fresco this accounts for its dignity and simplicity it would seem like a basrelief cut out of marble were it not for its wonderful colouring it is in the rudolf kann collection paris this artists other pictures are adoration of the shepherds adoration of the magi madonna and child with saints three saints and god the father coronation of the virgin and portrait of old man and boy xviii giotto di bordone pronounced jotto florentine school 12761337 pupil of cimabue giotto painted upon wood and in distemperthe mixture of colour with egg or some other jellylike substance we know nothing of his childhood except that he was a shepherd as we learn from a story told of him and his teacher cimabue the story runs that one day while giotto was watching his sheep high up on a mountain cimabue was walking abroad to study nature and he ran across a shepherd boy who was drawing the figure of a sheep with a piece of slate upon a stone in those days we can imagine how rare it was to find one who could draw anything ever so rudely immediately cimabue saw a chance to make an artist and he asked the little shepherd if he would like to be taught art in his studio giotto was overjoyed at the opportunity and at once he left the mountains for the town the shepherds crook for the brush in those days the studio of one like cimabue was really a workshop artists had to grind their own colours prepare their own panels upon which to paint and do a hundred other things of a workman rather than an artist kind in connection with their painting such a studio was crowded with apprenticesboys who did these jobs while learning from the master their teaching consisted in watching the artist and now and then receiving advice from him it was into such a shop as this in florence that giotto went and soon he was to become greater than his master even so we cannot think him great excepting for his time because his pictures compared with later art are crude stiff and strange no pupil was permitted to use a brush till he had learned all the craft of colour grinding and the like and this was supposed to take about six years these workshops were likely to be dull gloomy places and only a strong desire to do such things as they saw their master doing would induce a boy to persevere through the first drudgery of the work giotto persevered and not only became an original painter at a time when even cimabue hardly made figures appear human in outline but he designed the great campanile in florence and he saw it partly finished before he died the campanile is a wonder of architecture but giottos madonnas had to be improved upon as certainly as he had improved upon those of cimabue there are many amusing stories of giotto mainly telling of his good nature and his ugly appearance which everyone forgot in appreciation of his truly kind heart once a visit was made to his studio by the king of naples after the artist had become famous giotto was painting busily though the day was very hot the king entered and bade giotto not to be disturbed but to continue his work adding still if i were you i should not paint in such hot weather giotto looked up with a laugh in his eye neither would iif i were you sire he answered there is a famous saying as round as giottos o and this is how it came about the pope wanted the best of the florentine artists to do some work in rome for him and he sent out to them for examples of their work when the popes messenger came to giotto the artist was very busy when asked for some of his work to show the pope he paused snatched a piece of paper and with the brush he had been using which was full of red paint he hurriedly drew a circle and gave it to the messenger who stared at him butis this all he asked allyesand too much put it with the others this perfect circle and the account the messenger gave of his visit so delighted the pope that giotto was chosen from all the florentine artists to decorate the roman buildings thus giotto worked till he was fiftyseven or eight years old when he put aside his brush and turned to sculpture and architecture meantime he had far outstripped his master in art the arrangement of the groups is about the same but the figures look human and the draperies are more natural while he gives the appearance of length breadth and thickness to his thrones and enclosures we shall not choose a madonna for illustration but another of giottos masterpieces remembering that good as he was in his time he seems amazingly bad compared with those who came after him platethe meeting of st john and st anna at jerusalem in 1303 a certain enrico scrovegno had a private chapel built in the arena at padua and he sent for giotto to come there and adorn the whole of its walls and ceiling with frescoes these remain though the chapel is now emptied of all else and they suffice to bring scores of artlovers to padua the picture here reproduced represents the meeting and reconciliation between the father and mother of the virgin before her birth the peculiarly shaped eyes and eyebrows that giotto gives to all his characters are specially noteworthy here as in every one of the thirtyeight frescoes there are three rows of pictures one above the other and in them are portrayed the principal scenes in the lives of christ and the virgin the painter here reached his highwater mark showed the very best he could produce in sincere restrained art xix franz hals dutch school 1580041666 pupil of karel van mander franz hals belonged to a family which for two hundred years had been highly respected in haarlem in the netherlands the father of the painter left that town for political reasons in 1579 and it was at antwerp that franz was born sometime between that date and 1585 his parents took him back to haarlem as an infant and that is the town with which his name and fame are most closely associated little is known of his early life except that he began his studies with karel van mander and cornelis cornelissen what we know of his family life is not to his credit in the parish register of 1611 is recorded the birth of a son to franz hals and five years later he is on the public records for abusing his wife who died shortly afterward he married again within a year and the second wife bore him many children and survived him ten years five of his seven sons became painters franz hals drank too much and mixed too freely with the kind of disreputable people he loved to paint but he never became so degraded that his hand lost its cunning or his eye its keen vision for that which he wished to portray in 1644 he was made a director of the guild of st lucas an institution for the protection of arts and crafts in haarlem but from that time onward he sank in popular esteem deservedly he fell into debt then into pauperism and when he died about the age of eightysix he was buried at public expense in the choir of st bavon church in haarlem it was in the year 1616 that hals first became known as a master of his art by the painting of the st jovis shooting company one of the clubs composed of volunteers banded together for the defence of the town should occasion arise such guilds were common throughout holland and they became a favourite subject with hals as with other painters of the time who vied with one another in portraiture of the different members these groups were hung upon the walls of the chambers where meetings were held for social purposes in times of peace the men of highest rank are always given the most conspicuous places in the pictures the flag is generally the one bit of gorgeous colour in the scene but franz hals seized the opportunity to show his wonderful skill in detail while painting the cuffs and ruffs worn by these grandees in all his work there is an impression of strength rather than of beauty it is the charm of expressiveness he is aiming at rather than the charm of grace and colour to which the italian school was devoted he differed from that school also in his choice of subjects for he was distinctly and almost entirely a portrait painter and within his own limited range he is unsurpassed a wonderful collection of his works is to be seen in the haarlem town hall platethe nurse and the child considering the woeful life that franz hals led it is amazing to think that he of all artists is the best painter of good humour he puts a smile on the face of nearly every one of his leading characters whether it be a modest young girl a hideous old woman a strolling musician or a riotous soldier and in every case the laugh suits the subject it may have been his own easygoing shiftlessness his way of casting care aside with a jest that enabled him to live so long and to accomplish so much in spite of his poverty and other misfortunes the roguish look upon the face of this baby of the house of ilpenstein makes it appear older than the pleasant faced nurse the dress of the child is such as hals delighted to spend his talents upon the picture is in the berlin gallery among his best known paintings are the laughing cavalier the fool the man with the sword and hille bobbe the witch of haarlem xx meyndert hobbema dutch school 16371709 pupil of jacob van ruisdael when a man becomes famous many people claim his acquaintance and often many places his birthplace in hobbemas case it has never been decided whether he was born in the little town of koeverdam or in the city of haarlem or in amsterdam nor is it quite certain when he was born but what he did afterward we are all acquainted with no one knows much about the life of this artist but his master was doubtless his uncle van ruisdael hobbema was dead a hundred years before the world acknowledged his genius thus he reaped no reward for hard work and ambition he like rembrandt died in great poverty and with nearly the same surroundings rembrandt died forsaken in roosegraft street amsterdam and hobbema died in the same locality we must speak chiefly about his work since we know little of his personality or affairs if bcklins pictures seem to be composed of vertical lines hobbemas are as startling in their positive vertical and horizontal lines combined we are not likely to find elevations or gentle gradual depressions in his landscapes but straight horizons long trunked straight limbed trees and the landscape seems to be punctured here and there by an upright house or a spire it is startlingly beautiful and so characteristic that after seeing one or two of hobbemas pictures we are likely to know his work again wherever we may find it hobbema got at the soul of a landscape it was as if one painted a face that was dear to one and not only made it a good likeness but also painted the person as one felt him to beall the tenderness or maybe all the sternness it may be that hobbemas failure to get money and honours or at the very least kind recognition as a great artist while he lived influenced his painting and made him see mostly the sad side of beauty nor it is certain that his landscapes give one a strange feeling of sadness and desolation even when he paints a scene of plenty and fulness the french have made a phrase for his kind of work paysage intimemeaning the beloved countrythe one best known it is a fine phrase and it was first used to describe rousseaus and corots work but it especially applies to hobbemas while this artist was not yet recognised his uncle van ruisdael was known as a great artist the family must have been rich in spirit that gave so much genius to the world hobbema certainly loved his art above all things for he had no return during his lifetime save what was given by the joy of work there are those who complain that hobbema was a poor colourist true he used little besides grays and a peculiar green which seemed especially to please him but since that colouring belonged to the subjects he chose one cannot complain on the ground that what he did was unsatisfying for lack of knowledge about him we can think of him as a man of moods sad desolate ones at that because his work is too extreme and uniform in its character for us to believe his method was affected platethe avenue middelharnis holland this perhaps is one of the most characteristic of hobbemas pictures note a strange hopelessness in the scene as well as beauty the tall and solemn trees the high light upon the road suggesting to us all sorts of joys struggling through the cheerlessness of life what other artist would have chosen such a corner of nature for a subject to paint to quote a fine description he loved the countryside studied it as a lover and has depicted it with such intimacy of truth that the road to middelharnis seems as real today as it did over a hundred years ago to the artist we see the poplars with their lopped stems lifting their bushy tops against that wide high sky which floats over a flat country full of billowy clouds as the sky near the north sea is apt to be deep ditches skirt the road which drain and collect the water for purposes of irrigation and later on will join some deeper wider canal for purposes of navigation we get a glimpse on the right of patient perfection of gardening where a man is pruning his grafted fruit trees farther on a group of substantial farm buildings on the opposite side of the road stretches a long flat meadow or polder up to the little village which nestles so snugly around its tall church tower the latter fulfilling also the purpose of a beacon lit by night to guide the wayfarer on sea and land scene of tireless industry comfortable prosperity and smiling peace pride and love of country breathe through the whole scene to many of us the picture smiles less than it thrills with sadness perhaps it speaks thus only to those who find a kind of hurt in the revival of the spring which promises so much and may fulfill so little hobbemas watermill is very wellknown and so are his wooded landscape and haarlems little forest xxi william hogarth school of hogarth english 16971764 william hogarth like watteau originated his own school in short there never was anybody like him he was an editorial writer in charcoal and paint or in other words he had a story to tell every time he made a picture and there was an argument in it a right and a wrong and he presented his point of view by making pictures english artists in literature and in painting have done some great reformatory work charles dickens overthrew some dreadful abuses by writing certain novels the one which has most interest for children is the awful story of dotheboys hall which exposed the ill treatment of pupils in a certain class of english schools what dickens and charles reade did in literature hogarth undertook to do in painting he described social shams painted things as they were thus making many people ashamed and possibly better italians had always painted saints and madonnas but hogarth pretended to despise that sort of work and painted only human beings he did not really despise raphael titian and their brother artists but he was so disgusted with the use that had been made of them and their schools of art to the entire exclusion of more familiar subjects that he turned satirist and ridiculed everything first of all hogarth was an engraver he was born in london on the 10th december 1697 and eighteen days later was baptised in the church of st bartholemew the great his father was a school teacher and a literary hack which means that in literature he did whatever he could find to do reporting editing and so on hogarth must early have known something of vagabond life for his fathers life during his own youth must have brought him into association with all sorts of people he knew how madhouses were run how kings dined how beggars slept in goods boxes and many other useful items hogarth said of himself shows of all sorts gave me uncommon pleasure when an infant and mimicry common to all children was remarkable in me my exercises when at school were more remarkable for the ornaments which adorned them than for the exercises themselves he became an engraver or silverplater being apprenticed to mr ellis gamble at the sign of the golden angel cranbourne alley leicester fields engraving on silver plate was all well enough but hogarth aspired to become an engraver on copper and he has said that this was about the highest ambition he had while he was in cranbourne alley the shopcard which he engraved for mr ellis gamble may have been the first significant piece of work he undertook the card is still among the hogarth relics he set up as an engraver on his own account though he did study a little in sir james thornhills art school but whatever he learned he turned to characteristic account he continued to make shopcards shopbills and bookplates finally in 1727 a maker of tapestry engaged hogarth to sketch him a design end he set to work ambitiously he worked throughout that year upon the design but when he took it to the man it was refused the truth was that the man who had commissioned the work had heard that hogarth was an engraver and no painter and he had so little intelligence that he did not intend to accept his design however much it might have pleased him hogarth sued the man for his refusal and he won the suit he next began to make what he called conversation pieces little paintings about a foot high of groups of people the figures being all portraits these were very fashionable for a time and made some money for the artist both he and watteau were fond of the stage and both painted scenes from operas and plays in time he moved into lodgings at the golden head in leicester fields and there he made his home he had already begun the great paintings which were to make him famous among artists these were a series of pictures telling stories of fashionable and other life his own story of how he came to think of the picture series was that he had always wished to present dramatic storiespresent them in scenes as he saw them on the stage he had married the daughter of sir james thornhill and had never been thought of kindly by his fatherinlaw till he made so much stir with his first series then sir james approved of him and hogarth found life more pleasing there are very few anecdotes to tell of the artists life and the story of his pictures is much more amusing one of his first satires was made into a pantomime by theophilus gibber and another person made it into an opera many pamphlets and poems were written about it and finally china was painted with its scenes and figures there was as much to cry as to laugh over in hogarths pieces and that is what made them so truly great one of his great picture series was called the rakes progress and it was a warning to all young men against leading too gay a life it showed the rake at the beginning of his misfortunes gambling and in the last reaping the reward of his follies in a debtors prison and the madhouse there are eight pictures in that set in this series especially in the fifth picture there are extraordinary proofs of hogarths completeness of ideas upon the wall in the room wherein the rake marries an old woman for her money the ten commandments are hung all cracked and the creed also is cracked and nearly smudged out while the poorbox is covered with cobwebs the eight pictures brought to hogarth only seventy guineas one of his pictures was suggested to him by an incident which greatly angered him he had started for france on some errand of his own and was in the very act of sketching the old gate at calais when he was arrested as a spy now hogarth was a hardheaded englishman and when he was hustled back to england without being given time for argument he was so enraged that he made his picture as grotesque as possible to the lasting chagrin of france he painted the french soldiers as the most absurd thin little fellows imaginable and that picture has largely influenced peoples idea of the french soldier all over the englishspeaking world as hogarth grew old he grew also a little bitter and revengeful toward his enemies often taking his revenge in the ordinary way of belittling the people he disliked in his paintings hogarth came before reynolds or gainsborough in short was the first great english artist and his chief power lay in being able instantly to catch a fleeting expression and to interpret it an incident of hogarths youth illustrates this he had got into a row in a pothouse with one of the hangerson and when someone struck the brawler over the head with a pewter pot there in the midst of excitement and rioting hogarth whipped out his pencil and hastily sketched the expression of the chap who had been hit hogarth was friends with most of the theatre managers and one of his souvenirs was a gold pass given him by tyers the director of vauxhall gardens which entitled hogarth and his family to entrance during their lives this was in return for some passes which hogarth had engraved for tyer upon one occasion hogarth set off with some companions for a trip to the isle of sheppey incidentally forest wrote a sketch of their journey and hogarth illustrated it that work is to be found carefully preserved in the british museum the repeated copying and reproduction for sale of his pictures brought about the first effort to protect his works of art by copyright but it was not till he had done the rakes progress that he was able to protect himself at all and even then not completely just before his death he was staying at chiswick but the day before he died he was removed to his house in leicester fields he was buried in the chiswick churchyard and in that suburb of london may still be seen his old house and a mulberry tree where he often sat amusing children for whom he cared very much garrick wrote the following epitaph for his tomb if genius fire thee reader stay if nature touch thee drop a tear if neither move thee turn away for hogarths honourd dust lies here farewell great painter of mankind who reached the noblest point of art whose pictured morals charm the mind and through the eye correct the heart platethe marriage contract the picture used in illustration here is part of probably the very greatest artsermon ever painted called marriage la mode the story of it is worth telling the first act is laid in the drawingroom of the viscount squanderfieldis not that a fine name for the character on the left his lordship is seated pointing with complacent pride to his family tree which has its roots in william the conqueror but his rent roll had been squandered the gouty foot suggesting whither some of it has gone and to restore his fortunes he is about to marry his heir to the daughter of a rich alderman the latter is seated awkwardly at the table holding the marriage contract duly sealed signed and delivered the price paid for it being shown by the pile of money on the table and the bunch of cancelled mortgages which the lawyer is presenting to the nobleman who refuses to soil his elegant fingers with them over on the left is his weakling son helping himself at this critical turn of his affairs to a pinch of snuff while he gazes admiringly at his own figure in the mirror the lady is equally indifferent she has strung the ring on to her finger and is toying with it while she listens to the compliments being paid to her by counsellor silvertongue through an open window another lawyer is comparing his lordships new house that is in the course of building with the plan in his hand a marriage so begun could only end in misery this is the first act and the pictures that follow show all the steps of unhappiness which the couple take there are five more acts to that painted drama which is in the national gallery london xxii hans holbein the younger pronounced hahntz holbine german school 14971543 pupil of holbein the elder there were three generations of painters in the holbein family and the hans of whom we speak was of the third his grandfather was called old holbein and when more painters of the same name and family came along it became necessary to distinguish them from each other thus old holbein the elder holbein and young holbein the first one was not much of an artist still in a locality where at best there was not much art he was good enough to be remembered young holbein was born in augsburg which is in swabia in southern germany elder holbein and his father michael old holbein had moved there from schonenfeld a neighbouring village about forty three years before little hans was born the old michael bringing his family to the larger town where it was easier to make a living the elder holbein was a really good artist and well thought of in augsburg and when little hanss turn came he had no teacher but his father unless indeed we were to call him also a pupil of his elder brother ambrosius his uncle sigismund too taught him something of art for the whole holbein family seem to have been artists young holbein was never regularly apprenticed to any outsider art was not then taught as it is now the work of a beginner was often to paint for his master certain details which it was thought that he might handle properly while the master occupied himself with what he thought to be some more important part of the picture it is said that hans often painted the draperies of his fathers figures when his father was engaged upon the altar pieces so fashionable at the time the holbeins one and all must have been bad managers or improvident at any rate hans did not turn out well as a man and we read that his father was always in debt and difficulty although he received much money for his work and was not handicapped like drers father by a family of eighteen children the story of the holbeins is quite unlike that of the drers and not nearly so attractive some time before hans was twenty years of age the entire family had packed up and gone to live in lucerne while hans and his brother ambrosius went travelling together as most young germans went at that time before they settled down to the serious work of life the last we hear of ambrosius he had joined the painters guild in basel and probably he died not long afterward or at any rate while he was still young there was in basel a certain hans bar for whose wedding occasion hans holbein designed a table on which he pictured an allegory of st nobody this was very likely such work as our cartoonists do today but being the work of holbein it had great artistic value besides that he painted a schoolmasters sign to be hung outside the door as an illustrator holbein made the acquaintance of several authors about that time and started on the high road to fame he was a man of very little conscience or fine feeling and there could hardly be a greater contrast than that between the clean sweet life of drer and the brawling unfeeling one that hans holbein led drer married had no children but tenderly loved and cared for his wife taking her with him upon his journeys and making her happy holbein married and beat his wife had several children and took care of none of them his wife grew to look old and worn while he remained a gay looking sport quite tired of one whom he had had on his hands for ten years he wandered everywhere and left his family to shift for itself one writer in speaking of the two men says drer would never have deserted his wife whom he took with him even on his journey to the netherlands and he was bound by the same tenderness to his native town however much he rejoiced to receive a visit from bellini at venice or when at antwerp the artists instituted a torchlight procession in his honour nothing could have moved him to leave nuremberg drer loved his home holbein hated his holbein had a cold lightblue eye drer a soft and tender glance while drer lived he was the mainstay of his familyfather and brothers holbeins father died in misery and his brothers life was disastrous hans doing nothing to serve them and looking on at their sufferings indifferently there is a court document in existence which tells the particulars of hans holbeins arrest for getting into a brawl with a lot of goldsmiths apprentices during a night of carousal the court warned him that he would be more severely punished if he did not cease his lawless life and he was made to promise not to jostle pinch nor beat his lawful spouse when he died he made no provision in his will for his family there is a picture of his wife elizabeth schmidt to be seen in his madonna at solothurn holbein used her for the model she then was young and blooming and the model for the child was his own baby at that time he found them useful his life of folly can hardly be excused by impulsiveness or emotion for his pictures show little of either he was best at portrait painting at that time guilds and town councils wanted the portraits of their members preserved in some way and it was the habit of painters like holbein to form picturesque groups and give to such dramatic groupings the features of townsmen rembrandt did this much later than holbein when he painted the night watch or as it is more properly called the sortie probably holbeins first important work was to make title pages for the second edition of martin luthers translation of the new testament this ms was made about the time that holbeins work began to be of interest to the public and so the commission was given to him after a time this artist went to england with letters of introduction to sir thomas more chancellor to king henry viii sir thomas treated him very kindly and set him to work making portraits of his own family during the time he was living at mores home in chelsea the king himself used frequently to visit there and on one occasion he saw the brilliant portraits of the more family and inquired about the artist sir thomas offered the king any of the pictures he liked but henry viii asked to see the artist when brought before him holbeins fortune seemed to be made for the king asked him to go to court and paint for him remarking that now he had the artist he did not care about the pictures holbein seems to have been a favourite with henry and many anecdotes are told of his life at whitehall where he went to live once while holbein was engaged upon a portrait a nobleman insisted upon entering his studio after the artist had told him that he was painting the portrait of a lady by order of the king the nobleman insisted upon seeing it but holbein seized him and threw him down the stairs then he rushed to the king and told what had happened he had no sooner finished than the nobleman appeared and told his story the king blamed the nobleman for his rudeness you have not to do with holbein he said but with me i tell you of seven peasants i can make seven lords but of seven lords i cannot make one holbein begone and remember that if you ever attempt to avenge yourself i shall look upon any injury offered to the painter as done to myself it was holbein who visiting a brother artist and finding a picture on the easel painted a fly upon it when the artist returned he tried to brush the fly off then set about looking for the one who had deceived him his portrait painting was so superb that he received many commissions meantime sir thomas more had fallen into disfavour with the king and was to lose his head but it is written that the artists portraits betray nothing of this tragedy he was as ready to climb to fame by the favour of his generous patrons enemies as he had been to accept the offices of sir thomas more he painted the portraits of several of the wives of henry viii and it may be said that there was a good deal of that monarchs temperament to be found in holbein himself take him all in all hans was as detestable as a man as he was excellent as a painter in his adopted home in lucerne holbein had painted frescoes both on the inside and the outside of a citizens house and this house stood until 1824 when it was torn down to make way for street improvements but several artists hastily copied the frescoes so that they are not entirely lost before he left germany for england holbein had been commissioned to decorate the town hall in basel and a certain amount of money was voted for the work but after he had finished three walls he decided that the money was only enough to pay him for what he had already done the councillors agreed with him but as money was a little close in basel at that time they felt unable to give him more and so voted to let the back wall alone till further notice he painted one madonna whom he surrounded with the entire family of burgomaster meyer including even the burgomasters first wife who was dead this work is called the meyer madonna it is said that after holbeins return to basel he with others was persecuted for his religious principles but if this were true his persecutors went to considerable pains for nothing because holbein was never known to have any sort of principles religious or otherwise he was neither a protestant nor a catholic but a painter a man without convictions and without thought he did not care for family country friends politics religion nor for anything else so far as any one knows when he was asked why he had not partaken of the sacrament he answered that he wanted to understand the matter better before he did so thus he escaped punishment and when matters were explained to him he did whatever seemed safest and most convenient under the circumstances on his return to england he settled among the colony of german and netherland merchants who were in the habit of meeting at a place called the steelyard as their home and warehouses were grouped in that locality with a guild hall and a wineshop they alone patronised while associated with his compatriots holbein made portraits of many of them and these are magnificent works of art he painted them separately or in groups in their offices and in their guild hall as the case might be the men whom he thus painted were gorg gisze hans of antwerp derich berck geryck tybis ambrose fallen and many others he designed the arch which the guild erected upon the occasion of anne boleyns coronation and he painted henrys next queen jane seymour holbein painted many portraits of henry viii and probably all those dated after 1537 were either copies or founded upon the portrait which holbein made and which was destroyed with whitehall while he painted for henry holbein received a sort of retainers fee of thirty pounds a year but he may have received sums for outside commissions which he undertook on one occasion when he took a journey to upper burgundy to paint a portrait of the duchess whom henry contemplated making his next wife the king gave him ten pounds out of his own purse we have no record of vast sums such as raphael received henry did not succeed in making the duchess his wife so holbein was sent to paint anotheranne of clevesthat henry might see what he thought of her before he undertook to make her his queen holbein did a disastrous deed for he made anne a very acceptable looking woman the portrait hangs in the louvre and henry negotiated for her on the strength of that portrait later when he saw her he was utterly disgusted and disappointed holbein notwithstanding this trick was employed to paint the next wife of henry and doubtless he also made the miniature of catherine howard which is in windsor castle holbein finally died of the plague and no one knows where he was buried his wife died later and it was left for his son philip who was said to be a good wellbehaved lad to bring honours to the family he was apprenticed in paris and settling later in augsburg he founded a branch of the holbein family on which the emperor matthias conferred a patent of nobility making them the holbeins of holbeinsberg platerobert cheseman with his falcon this is one of the best of the many splendid portraits holbein painted it hangs in the hague gallery the gentleman was fortyeight years old and in the portrait he wears a purplishred doublet of silk and a black overcoat which was the fashion of the day all trimmed with fur he has curly hair just turning gray his left hand is gloved and on it he holds his falcon while with the other hand he strokes its feathers of all sports at that time falconry was the most fashionable and every fine gentleman had his sporting birds robert cheseman lived in essex he was rich and a leader in english politics his father was keeper of the wardrobe to henry viii and he himself served in many public offices he was one of the gentleman chosen to welcome anne of cleves when she landed on english soil to marry henry viii these details were first published by mr arthur chamberlain and are taken from his sketch of holbein and his works among holbeins other famous pictures are the ambassadors hans of antwerp christina of denmark jane seymour anne of cleves and st george and the dragon xxiii william holman hunt english preraphaelite school 1827 pupil of academy school the story of the preraphaelites is all by itself a story of art holman hunt was one of three who formed this brotherhood and he with one other are the only ones whom some of us think worthy of giving a place in art this is to be the story of the brotherhood rather than a story of one man the last great artist england had had before this extraordinary group was j m w turner truly a wonderful man but after him englands painters became more and more commonplace drawing further and further away from truth there was one j f lewis who went away to syria and lived a lonely and studious life trying to paint with fidelity sacred scenes but he was not great enough to do what his conscience and desires demanded of him and finally constable declared that the end of art in england had come but it had not for up in london in the very heart of the city in cheapside wood street there was born in april 1827 a child destined to be a brilliant and wonderful man who was actually to rescue english art from death many do not think thus but enough of us do to warrant the statement the new artist was holman hunt he was the son of a london warehouseman with no inclination whatever for learning so that it seemed simply a waste of time to send him to school this continually repeated history of artists who seem to know nothing outside their brushes and colours is astonishing but it is true that artists for the most part must be regarded as artists pure and simple and not as men of even reasonably good intellectual attainments and more or less this accounts for their low estate centuries ago one does not associate learning and the artist when we have such splendid examples as drer and two or three others we discuss their intellectuality because they are so unusual holman hunt was like most of his brother artists in all but his art he hated school and at twelve years of age was taken from it his father wanted him to become a warehouse merchant like himself and he began life as clerk or apprentice to an auctioneer he next went into the employment of some calicoprinters of manchester the designing of calicoes can hardly be called art even if the department of design had fallen to holman hunts lot and we have no evidence that it did but he started to be an artist nevertheless there in the printshop he found in his new place another clerk who cared for art and this sympathy encouraged him to fix his mind upon painting more than ever he used to draw such natural flies upon the window panes that his employer tried one day to shoo away a whole colony of flies that seemed miraculously to have settled this gave the clerks much amusement and also attracted attention to holman hunts genius his very small salary was spent not on his support but in lessons from a portrait painter of the city his parents did not like this but they could not help themselves and thus this greatest of the preraphaelites began his work the preraphaelites were a little group of men who believed that artists were drawing too much on their imaginations not painting things as they saw them and that the painter had become incapable of close observation he worked in his studio did not get near enough to nature and instead of trying to follow along this line this group of men with their new and partly correct ideas meant to go back further than the great masters themselves and present an elemental art this was a part of their scheme and partly it was justified but of all the men who undertook to make a new school holman hunt was the only one who remained and will remain forever a representative he alone stuck to the original purpose of the group and developed it into a truly great school so that it is he alone we need to know after he began to take lessons of the portrait painter in london he developed so quickly that he found by painting portraits three days a week he could pay his own expenses and the rest of the time he devoted to study he tried to be admitted to the academy schools twice and was twice refused before they would receive him it was there in the academy the three original preraphaelites met for the first time they were holman hunt dante gabriel rossetti and millais after entering the school hunt painted and sold four excellent pictures but they all seem to have been lost nobody can trace them he was not yet a preraphaelite all this time hunt was half ill because he knew that he was grieving his father of whom he was devotedly fond and the strain of trying to work while he was unhappy nearly destroyed him the pictures that he exhibited at the royal academy were so poor that the commission declared they should not only be removed but that hunt ought really to be forbidden to exhibit any more this must have been a great blow to the young and struggling artist and to add to this trouble his father was being jeered at for having such a goodfornothing son hunts pictures in the academy were so much despised that his father was told his son was a disgrace to him and we may be sure that did not help the young fellow who meantime was earning a living not by painting pictures but by cleaning up those of another man dyce who had painted on the walls of trinity house engaged him to clean and restore those paintings and hunt was doing this for his bread and butter at that time he became so downhearted and discouraged that he almost decided to leave england altogether and go to live in canada away from his friends who jeered and his family who reproached him but just then millais one of the successful painters whom he had met in the academy school who could afford to be generous came to hunts aid and gave him the means of living while he painted the hireling shepherd this was destined to be the turning point in hunts luck for that painting was properly hung at the exhibition and it received recognition after that he painted a picture which he sold on the installment planbeing paid by the purchaser so much a month meantime he owed his landlady a large sum and he says himself that he suffered almost unbearable pain at passing her and her husband week after week without being able to even talk of annulling his debts in time he not only settled that bill which distressed him but paid back his friend millais the money loaned by him hunt rarely took a commission because to do so meant that he must paint a picture after the manner his employer wished and hunt had certain ideas of art in which he believed and therefore would not bind himself to depart from them but after a little success which enabled him to pay his bills he did undertake a commission from sir thomas fairbairn and it was called the awakened conscience he finished this picture on a january day late in the afternoon and that very night he left england setting out upon a longedfor journey to the holy land where he meant to study the country and people till he believed himself able to paint a truthful picture of sacred scenes he refused to paint pictures of eastern jews who should look like parisians with venetian backgrounds he meant to paint oriental scenes as nearly as he could as they might have taken place he came back to his english home just two years and one month from the time he had left it and he brought back a picture of the goat upon which the jews loaded their sins and then turned loose in wasteplaces to wander and die the scapegoat was a great picture but before he left england he had painted a greaterthe one we see herethe light of the world he had depended upon the sale of the scapegoat to pay his way for a time after his return home and alas it did not sell more than that his beloved father died and this added to his sense of desolation for he had not been sufficiently successful before his death to justify himself in his fathers eyes these things so overwhelmed his sensitive mind with trouble that his condition became very serious and if certain good friends had not stood by him loyally he would probably never have painted again he began at last another ambitious picturefinding of christ in the templebut while he was engaged upon this he had to paint mere potboilers also in order to get on at all and he says that half the time the great picture stood with its face to the wall while he was trying merely to earn bread and butter the wonderful louis blanc tried once to plan a way by which all deserving people should have in this world equal opportunity to try this has never been worked out it never will be but holman hunt reminds us how much the world loses by not providing that equal opportunity no one deserves more than his chance but such struggles of genius tell us that all is not fair hunt persevered with this christ in the temple and when finished he sold it for 5500 guineasa larger sum than he had ever before been given for a painting he no sooner received his money for this great picture than off he went once more to the holy land he was conscientious in everything he did and never before had an artist painted scenes of christ that carried such a sense of truth with them the set haloes seen about the heads of the saints and of holy people even in raphaels pictures and in those of the very greatest artists of his time disappeared with holman hunts coming in the light of the world the halo is an accidentthe great white moon happening to rise behind the christs headand there we have the halo simple natural only suggestive not artificial then too in the shadow of death there is a menacing shadow of the crossmade upon the wall by christs body as he naturally stretches out his arms after his work in the carpenter shop there is not one false note that shocks us or makes us feel that after all the story itself is affected and artificial everything that is symbolical is brought about naturally they are sincere truthful pictures that speak to the mind as well as to the eye hunts colouring and many other technical matters are often far from perfect but there is something besides technicality to be considered in judging a picture for a time while the three men hunt rossetti and millais kept together their pictures were signed p r b as a sign of their league but this did not last very long and afterward hunt signed his pictures independently after the brotherhood had worked against the greatest discouragements for a long time and felt nearly hopeless of success john ruskin one of the greatest of critics and most fearless of men who was so much respected that his words had great influence suddenly published a defence of these preraphaelites he declared that they were the greatest artists of the time and while scorning their critics he applauded those three young men till he turned the tide and everybody began to know what truly brilliant work they were doing ruskins words came hunt said as thunder out of a clear sky when the brotherhood was formed the three young men thought they should have a papera periodical of some sort in which they might tell of their purposes and express their ideas and so rossetti who wrote as well as painted proposed that they print such a periodical once a month and call it the germ and the p r bs were to be joint proprietors rossetti had first thought of a different title thoughts toward nature and his brother w m rossetti who was going to take charge of the monthly thought that expressed the preraphaelites idea but it was finally agreed to call it the germ only two numbers could be published by the preraphaelites because nobody bought it and the young mens money gave out but the printers came to the rescue and put up the money to issue two or three more germs although that journal failed utterly its four numbers were worth publishing and are today worth reading they were truly valuable for they contained a story and poem by dante gabriel rossetti besides work of the other p r bs above all things hunt was conscientious in his work trying with all his might to represent things as be believed them to be when he made his scapegoat he went to the shores of the dead sea to paint accompanied only by arab guides and there he found the desolate hard landscape for his picture the hardships he experienced were very many the wretched goat he took with him died in the desert of that dreary place after it had been no more than sketched in but back in jerusalem hunt finished the goat ruskins description of the picture helps one to feel all the desolation of the subject the salt sand of the wilderness of ziph where the weary goat is dying the neighbourhood is stagnant and pestiferous polluted by the decaying vegetables brought down by the jordan in its floods and the bones of the beasts of burden that have died by the way of the sea lie like wrecks upon its edge bared by the vultures and bleached by the salt ooze even the superstitious arabs would not go near the spot which hunt chose as the scene of his picture but hunt endured all things believing it due to his art when he painted christ in the temple he needed jewish models and it was almost impossible for him to get them he could not let them know what they were to represent or they would not have sat for him at all but he succeeded in painting the first semitic presentment of the semitic scriptures in jerusalem the jews heard that he had come to traffic with the souls of the faithful and they forbade him to have any jews come into his studio so that he could not finish the picture there back in london he had to find his models in the jewish school he left the figures of christ and the virgin till the last and then painted them from a lady of the ancient race distinguished alike for her amiability and beauty and a lad in one of the jewish schools to which the husband of the lady furnished a friendly introduction thus step by step through the greatest difficulties holman hunt established a new school of paintingallegory with a modern treatment which all could understand platethe light of the world this is the most popular picture of a sacred subject ever painted and john ruskins description of it here quoted is the best ever written or that can be written on the left of the picture is seen the door of the human soul it is fast barred its bars and nails are rusty it is knitted and bound to its stanchions by creeping tendrils of ivy showing that it has never been opened a bat hovers over it its threshold is overgrown with brambles nettles and fruitless corn christ approaches in the night time he wears the white robe representing the power of the spirit upon him the jewelled robe and breastplate representing the sacredotal investitude the rayed crown of gold interwoven with the crown of thorns not dead thorns but now bearing soft leaves for the healing of the nations the lantern carried in christs left hand is the light of conscience its fire is red and fierce it falls only on the closed door on the weeds that encumber it and on an apple shaken from one of the trees of the orchard thus marking that the entire awakening of the conscience is not to ones own guilt alone but to the guilt of the world or hereditary guilt this light is suspended by a chain wrapt around the wrist of the figure showing that the light which reveals sin to the sinner appears also to chain the hand of christ the light which proceeds from the head of the figureis that of the hope of salvation it springs from the crown of thorns and though itself sad subdued and full of softness is yet so powerful that it entirely melts into the glow of it the forms of the leaves and boughs which it crosses showing that every earthly object must be hidden by this light where its sphere extends if you will study every detail of this reproduction finding all the objectsthe apple the rusty boltsnoting how the full risen moon has formed a natural nimbus for the sacred head and then reread what ruskin has said you will discover the rarest truths in holman hunts picture the several pictures which he painted but which cannot now be found are hark which was first exhibited in the royal academy scene from woodstock the eve of st agnes jerusalem by moonlight the king of hearts moonlight at salerno interior of the mosque of omar the pathless water winter afternoon sussex downs penzance the archipelago willothewisp ivybridge the

morning prayer bianca past and present and dead mallard should you ever find one of these pictures bearing the initials p r b or those of holman hunt you will have made an interesting discovery and should make it known to others xxiv george inness american 18251897 pupil of regis gignoux george inness was destined to keep a grocery store as his father had kept one before him and had grown rich in it when george was a young man he was given a grocery store in newark new jersey a very small store indeed and it is not surprising that the young man preferred art to butter and eggs the inness family had just moved from newburg probably the elder innes seeking in newark a good location for his sons beginning the first artwork inness did was engraving as he had been apprenticed to that business but afterward he studied with gignoux a pupil of delaroche at that time there was what is known as the hudson river school its ideas were set and formal and not very inspiring aside from the subjects treated church was then a young man like inness and he was studying in the hudson river school but the young grocer struck out a line for himself he was forty years old before he got to paris but once there he turned to the men at barbizonrousseau millet corot and the restfor inspiration and began to do beautiful things indeed rousseau became his friend and the art of inness grew large and rich through such influences inness had inherited much religious feeling from his scotch ancestors and all his work was conscientious very carefully done when inness returned from paris he was not yet well known he went to montclair new jersey to live and it was there that he did his best work finally after he was fifty years old he became known as a truly splendid painter he loved best to paint quiet scenes of morning evening sunset and the like his pictures began to gain value and one that he had sold for three hundred dollars jumped in price to ten thousand and more his work is not equally good because his moods greatly influenced him plateberkshire hills this picture in the george a hearn collection is full of the sense of restfulness that the works of this artist always convey the trees are as motionless as the distant hills and if the oxen are moving at all it is but slowly some other inness paintings are the georgia pines sunset on the passaic the wood gatherers and after a summer shower xxv sir edwin henry landseer english school 18021873 pupil of his father john landseer it is pleasant to speak of one artist whose good work began in the companionship of his father the case of edwin landseer is most unusual his father was a skilful engraver who loved art and encouraged the cultivation of it in his son as other fathers of painters encouraged them to become priests or haberdashers or bakers as the case might be little landseers beginning has been described by his father as he and a friend stood looking upon one of the scenes of his childhood these two fields were edwins first studio many a time have i lifted him over this very stile i then lived in foley street and nearly all the way between marylebone and hampstead was open fields it was a favourite walk with my boys and one day when i had accompanied them edwin stopped by this stile to admire some sheep and cows which were quietly grazing at his request i lifted him over and finding a scrap of paper and a pencil in my pocket i made him sketch the cow he was very young indeed thennot more than six or seven years old after this we came on several occasions and as he grew older this was one of his favourite spots for sketching he would start off alone or with john thomas or charles and remain till i fetched him in the afternoon i would then criticise his work and make him correct defects before we left the spot sometimes he would sketch in one field sometimes in the other but generally in the one beyond the old oak we see there as it was more pleasant and sunny all the landseer men were gifted and the mother was the beautiful woman whom reynolds painted as a gleaner carrying a bundle of wheat upon her head there were seven little landseers the oldest of them being thomas the famous engraver whose reproduction of his brothers works will preserve them to us always even after the originals are gone the first of edwins drawings which seemed to his family worthy of publishing was a great st bernard dog such a wonderful performance for a little fellow of thirteen that thomas engraved it and distributed it all over england little edwin had seen this beautiful dog one day in the streets of london in a servants charge and he was so delighted with its beauty that he followed the two home and asked the dogs owner if he might sketch him the st bernard was six feet four inches long and at the middle of his back stood two feet seven inches in height a great critic said that this drawing was one of the very finest that any master of art had ever made though it was done by a little child of thirteen years and it is also said that landseer himself never did anything better than that littleboy work a live dog who was let into the room with itas critic maybeproved to be the most flattering of such because he bristled instantly for a fight while the boy was still thirteenwhich seems to have been a magic and not a tragic number to himhe exhibited pictures in the royal academy these were a mule and a dog with a puppy in the stories of famous artists we are told that he was a fine manly little chap with light curly hair and very well behaved when he became a student of the academy the keeper fuseli used to look about among the students and cry where is my little dog boy if landseer was not in his place the little chaps favourite dog was his own brutus which he painted lying at full length and though the picture was small it sold for seventy guineas this means an earning capacity indeed for a small boy when he was but seven years old he had made pictures of lions and tigers each with a different expression from the other and each with a character of its own critics spoke specially of the tigers whiskers as admirable in the rendering of foreshortened curves tigers whiskers were thought to be most difficult things to make but in landseers pictures they were as natural as life the great success of the artists animal pictures was that he made them seem to have human intelligence and it was also said that if one only saw the dogs collar as landseer painted it he would know it to be the work of a great artist that a great dogpicture must be attached to it at least one of his pictures had a remarkable history he had been commissioned by the hon h pierrpont to paint a white horse in a stable after the painting was ready for delivery it disappeared and for twentyfour years it could not be found at last it was discovered in a hayloft it had been stolen by a servant and hidden there in spite of the long years that had passed landseer sent it at once to the man for whom it had been made with the message that he had not retouched it nor changed it in the least because said he i thought it better not to mingle the style of my youth with that of my old age one of landseers early advisers had told him he must dissect animals to get the proper effects in painting them as it was necessary for him to understand their construction so one time when a famous old lion died in the exeter exchange menagerie landseer got its body and dissected it and immediately afterward he painted three great lion pictures the lion disturbed at his repast a lion enjoying his repast and a prowling lion sir walter scott became so enchanted with landseers pictures that the great novelist came to london to take the young artist to his home at abbotsford his dogs are the most magnificent things i ever saw said scott leaping and bounding and grinning all over the canvas landseer lived in the centre of london till he was more than thirty years old and then looking for more quiet and space he bought a very small house and garden at no 1 st johns wood there was not much room in the house but it had a stable attached which made a fine studio and there landseer lived with a sister of his for nearly fifty years when he first wished to rent the house the landlord asked him a hundred pounds premium which landseer felt that he could not pay and he was about to give it up when a friend declared that if the matter of money was all that prevented him he was to rent it immediately and he could repay him as he chose landseer then took the house his friend paying down the premium and landseer returned the money twentypounds at a time till all the debt was paid landseer made this a famous and hospitable house and it is said that more great people gathered under his roof than had ever gathered about any other artist with the exception of sir joshua reynolds that was the house in which landseers loving old father spent his last days and finally died a story is told of the witty dorsay who would call out at the door when he went to visit the artist landseer keep de dogs off me i want to come in and some of dem will bite meand dat fellow in de corner is growling furiously on one of his several visits to abbotsford where he went many times after his first invitation to enjoy scotts delightful hospitality he painted a famous dog of sir walters called maida which died six weeks afterward there are several such stories about dogs who died rather tragically and were also painted by landseer the two king charles spaniels which he painted both died soon after sitting to the great painter they had been pets of mr vernon who commissioned the painting and the white blenheim spaniel fell from a table and was killed while the king charles fell through the railings of a staircase and was picked up dead the great bloodhound countess belonging to mr bell who gave her picture to the academy was watching for her masters return one dark night and when she heard the wheels of his carriage then his voice she leaped from the balcony but missed her footing and fell nearly dead at mr bells feet that gentleman loved the dog so much that he was distracted and taking her into his gig knowing that she must die he raced in to london again that same night and rousing sir edwin begged him to paint the dog before it was too late then and there was the sketch of the dying animal made sir edwin landseer was the most versatile and entertaining of artists he was a wit and could also perform all sorts of sleight of hand tricks besides being so quick with his pencil that his doings seemed miraculous one evening during a conversation with many friends someone declared that in point of time sir edwin could do a recordsketch one young woman spoke up and said there is one thing that even he cannot dohe cannot make two different pictures at the same time think not cried sir edwin let us see gaily taking two pencils he rapidly drew a stags head with one hand and a horses head with the other landseer became the guest of royalty a favourite of queen victoria whose dog dash was one of the many famous dogs painted by him dash was the favourite spaniel of the duchess of kent victorias mother and the queens biographer says that she too loved him very much on coronation day she had been away from him longer than usual and when the great state coach rolled up to the palace steps she could hear dash barking for her in the hall oh she exclaimed theres dash and throwing aside the ball and sceptre which she carried she hurried to change her fine robes in order to wash the dog this is a very homelike and picturesque story but it is possibly not true doubtless the little queen heard the dog barkand was glad to see him at windsor landseer painted another royal dog islay the pet terrier of victoria also dandie dinmont belonging to the princess alice then eos who was prince albertsking edwardsdog all the last years of sir edwin landseer life the royal family were his devoted and comforting friends the painter suffered much and during his visits to balmoral he wrote to his sister how the queen used to go several times a day to his room to look after his comfort and to inquire about his condition he wrote the queen kindly commands me to get well here she has today been twice to my room to show additions recently added to her already rich collection of photographs why i know not but since i have been in the high lands i have for the first time felt wretchedly weak without appetite the easterly winds and now again the unceasing cold rain may possibly account for my condition but i cant get out drawing tires me however i have done a little better today the doctor residing in the castle has taken me in hand and gives me leave to dine today with the queen and the rest of the royal family flogging would be mild compared with my sufferings no sleep fearful cramp at night accompanied by a feeling of faintness and distressful feebleness when he was well he was gay and cheerful and dickens thackeray and many other noted men were his friends we are told that above all things sir edwin was a great mimic and that one night at dinner he threw everybody into fits of laughter by imitating his friend the sculptor sir francis chantry it was at the sculptors table where a large party was assembled chantry called sir edwins attention when the cloth was removed to the reflection of light in the highly polished table come here and sit in my place said chantry and see the perspective you can get then he went and stood by the fire while landseer sat in his place seated then in chantrys chair landseer called out in perfect imitation of his host come young man you think yourself ornamental now make yourself useful and ring the bell chantry did so and when the butler came in he was confused and amazed to hear his masters voice from where landseer sat in chantrys place at the table the voice of his master from the head of the table ordered claret while his master really stood before the fire with his hands under his coattails we are told that landseer stood his pictures on their heads or upon one corner or looked at them from between his legs any way every way to get a complete view of them from all quarters he went to bed very late and got up very late but in the mornings while lying in bed he mostly thought out the subjects of his pictures he was not much of a sportsman preferring to paint animals rather than to kill them and one day when hunting he saw a fine stag before him instead of firing at it he thrust his gun into a gillies hands crying hold that hold that and whipping out his pencil and pad he began to sketch the stag whereupon the gillies were disgusted that he should miss so fine a shot and they said something to each other in gaelic which sir edwin must have understood for he became very angry it was a pity wrote one who knew all his qualities that landseer who might have done so much for the good of the animal kind never wrote on the subject of their treatment he had a strong feeling against the way some dogs are tied up only allowed their freedom now and then he used to say a man would fare better tied up than a dog because the former can take his coat off but a dog lives in his forever he declared a tiedup dog without daily exercise goes mad or dies in three years he had a wonderful power over dogs and he told one lady it was because he had peeped into their hearts a great mastiff rushed delightedly upon him one day and someone remarked how the dog loved him i never saw the dog before in my life the artist said while teaching some horses tricks for astleys he showed his friends some sugar in his hand and said here is my whip his studio was full of pets and one dog used as a model used to bring the masters hat and lay it at his feet when he got tired of posing this charming man suffered a great deal before his death and had dreadful fits of depression during one of these he wrote i have got trouble enough ten or twelve pictures about which i am tortured and a large national monument to complete that monument was the one in trafalgar square for which he designed the lions at the base if i am bothered about anything and everything no matter what i know my head will not stand it much longer later he wrote my health or rather condition is a mystery beyond human intelligence i sleep seven hours and awake tired and jaded and do not rally till after luncheon j l came down yesterday and did her best to cheer me i return to my own home in spite of kind invitations from mr and mrs gladstone to meet princess louise at breakfast of the many anecdotes told of this great man his introduction to the king of portugal furnishes the most amusing i am delighted to make your acquaintance the king said i am so fond of beasts before he died he had made a large fortune from his work and during his illness he was tended most lovingly by his friends and sister one day walking in his garden much depressed he said sadly i shall never see the green leaves again but he did live through other seasons he wished to die in his studio and at one time when he was much distracted the queen wrote him not to fear but to trust those who were doing all they could for him that her confidence in his physicians and nurses was complete at last with brother sister friends and fortune about him the great animal painter died and on october 11 1873 and was buried with great honours in st pauls cathedral platethe old shepherds chief mourner of all the dogs landseer loved to paint the sheep collie has the most character and here he shows us one expressing in every line of his face and form the most profound grief the glengarry bonnet on the floor beside the shepherds staff the spectacles lying on the bible the rams horn the vacant chair the black and white shawl known as a shepherds plaidall these things have failed to comfort this humble follower we can imagine him not bounding ahead with a joyous bark but walking staidly behind the coffin when it is borne away and laying himself down upon his masters grave perhaps to die of starvation as some of his kind have been known to do the painting is one of the sheepshanks collection in the south kensington museum among landseers other famous dog pictures are low life and high life dignity and impudence and the sleeping bloodhound all in the national gallery xxvi claude lorrain gellee classical french school 16001689 pupil of godfrey wals of all the contrasts between the early and later lives of great artists claude lorrain gives us the most complete he was born to make pastry his family may have been all pastry cooks because people of lorrain were famous for that work anyway as a little chap he was apprenticed to one his parents were poor lived in the duchy of lorrain and from that political division the artist was named the town in which he was born was chamagne and his real name was gelle as a pastry cooks apprentice he served his time and then without any thought of becoming anything else in the world he set off with several other pastry cooks to go to rome where their talents were to be well rewarded but how strangely things fall out in rome he was engaged to make tarts for agostine tassi a landscape painter his work was not simply to furnish his master with desserts but to do general housekeeping and it fell to his lot to clean tassis paint brushes so far as we know this was the first introduction of claude lorrain to art other than culinary from cleaning brushes it was but a step to trying to use them upon canvas and tassi being a goodnatured man began to give lorrain instruction till the pastry cook became his masters assistant in the studio this led to a larger and larger life for the young frenchman and he copied great masters did original things and finally in his twentyfifth year returned to france a fullfledged artist he remained there two years and then went back to italy where he lived till he died the visit to france turned out fortunately because on his way back he fell in with one of the original twelve members of the french academy charles errard who became the first director of the academy in rome a warm friendship sprang up between the men and errard was very helpful to the young artist nevertheless lorrain did not gain much fame till about his fortieth year when he was noticed by cardinal bentivoglio and was given certain commissions by him he grew in bentivoglios favour so much that the cardinal introduced him to the pope the catholic church set the fashions in art politics and history of all sorts at that time so that lorrain could not have had better luck than to become its favourite the pope was urban viii whose main business was to hold the power of the church and make it stronger if he could so that he was continually building fortresses and other fortifications and he had use for artists and decorators lorrains fame outlasted the life of urban viii and he became a favourite in turn with each of the three succeeding popes all this time he was doing fine work in italy and for italy besides receiving orders for pictures from france holland germany spain and england for his fame had reached throughout the world besides leaving many paintings behind him when he died he left half a hundred etchings also a more precise record of his work than most artists have left he executed two hundred sketches in pen or pencil washed in with brown or india ink the high lights being brought out with touches of white on the backs of them the artist noted the date on which the sketch was developed into a picture and for whom the latter was intended the story is that his popularity produced many imitators and that he adopted this means to establish the identity of his own work and distinguish it from the many copies made these sketches were collected in a volume by lorrain and called liber veritatis and for more than a hundred years the dukes of westminster have owned this plateacis and galatea this picture in the dresden gallery is a scene from the mythical story of a goddess who fell in love with the youthful son of a faun and a naiad thus she excited the jealous fury of the cyclops polythemus who is seen in the picture herding his flock of sheep upon the high cliff at the right soon he will rise and hurl a rock upon acis crushing the life out of him so that there will be nothing left for galatea to do but to turn him into the river acis but meanwhile the lovers are unconscious and happy venus is reposing near them on the waves and cupid is closer still while the sea in the background seems to be stirred with a fresh morning breeze some

14011428 pupil of ghibertio donatello and brunellesco this artist who lived and died within the century that witnessed the discovery of america was famous for more than his painting he was the original inventor who first learned and taught the mixing of colours with oils thus making the peculiar distemper unnecessary the story of italian artists includes a history of their names for the italians seem to have had most remarkable reasons for naming children for example this artist masaccio was born on st thomass day hence his name of tommaso presently for short or for love he was called maso and to cap all being a careless lad his friends added the derogatory accio and there we have the artist completely named he owed nothing of this to his father who was plain or ornamentally ser giovanni di simone guidi of castello san giovanni in the valdamo as a very little boy it was plain to be seen that slovenly thomas was going to be a great artist and no time was lost in putting him to work with the best of masters he was a veritable inventive genius until his time difficulties in drawing had been overcome mostly by ignoring them since no artist had been able to draw a foreshortened foot it had been the fashion in art to paint people standing upon their tiptoes to make it possible for an artist to paint the foot the enterprising thomas came along and he decided that feet must be painted both flat and crossed on tiptoe or otherwise in short he did not mean to lose by a foot he worked at this problem day and night till at last the naturally poised foot came into existence for the artist never after masaccios time did an artist paint the foot stretched upon the toes moreover until his time flesh had never been painted of a remotely natural colour so masaccio set about combining colours till he made one that had the tint of real flesh thus he was the first to overcome the difficulties of drawing and the first to discover a mixture that would not leave a glazed hard unnatural appearance and be likely to crack and destroy the finest effort of an artist he worked during his youth in pisa where the leaning tower stands then he worked in florence finally in rome but those early pictures are long since gone it was a century of adventure and discovery as well as of art and with so much change so many wars and rumours of wars many great art works were lost besides the horrible plague swept italy east west north and south who was to concern himself with saving works of art when human life was going out wholesale all over the land masaccio was certainly very poor most of his life he lived with his mother and his brother giovanni an artist like himself but not nearly so brilliant masaccio could not spend his life in painting but had to eke out the family fortunes by keeping a little shop near the old badia and being pestered day and night by his creditors he was forced again and again to go to the pawn shop somewhere about 1422 careless thomas painted his greatest picture which was doomed to destruction too early for us to know much about it but it was named san paolo and it was painted in the bellroom of the church of the carmine in florence the figure for his model was an illustrious personage bartoli dangiolini who had held many honourable offices in florence for many years a critic and friend of artists tells us that the portrait was so great it lacked only the power of speech in this picture masaccio made his first great triumph in the foreshortening of feet he undertook to celebrate the consecration of the church of the carmine and for this he made many frescoes among which was a correct painting of the procession as it entered from the cloisters of the church among the citizens who followed in its wake portraits are introduced of brunellesco donatello masolino felice brancacci the founder of the chapel giovanni di bicci de medici and others including the porter of the convent with the key of the door in his hand this work was thought to be very wonderful because the figures grew smaller in the distance thereby giving perspective for the first time imagine how crude a thing was painting in the day of careless thomas that fresco is long since gone but drawings of it still exist which tell us something of the people of christopher columbuss dayprevious to their appearance and their conditions after masaccio had finished the procession he went back to his painting of the chapel and in the end covered three of its four walls with his works many of those paintings are scenes from the life of st peter and several were worked at by other artists than masaccio masaccio was greater than raphael greater than michael angelo in so far as he pointed the way that they were to go having solved for them all the problems that had kept artists from being great before him sir joshua reynolds says that he appeared to be the first who discovered the path that leads to every excellence to which the art afterward arrived and may therefore be justly considered one of the great fathers of modern art the artist lived but a little time and was most likely poisoned nobody knows but it is said that other painters were so wildly jealous of his original genius that they wished him out of the way and his death was at least mysterious he drew very rapidly and let the details go caring only to represent motion and action because he painted so many portraits into his pictures there was great life and animation in them and people said of him that he painted not only the body but the soul plateartists portrait footnote many artists have left us portraits of themselves painted no doubt with the aid of a mirror in a group or alone this one of masaccio in the naples museum shows him to have been a picturesque model some of his known pictures are the frescoes in the church of st clemente in rome the frescoes in the brancacci chapel in the church of the carmine st peter baptising and the madonna and child with st anne which is in the accademia at florence xxviii jean louis ernest meissonier pronounced maysohnyay french school 18151891 pupil of lon cogniet this artist was born at lyons his father was a salesman and an arttraining seemed impossible for the young man because the meissoniers were poor people nevertheless he was so persevering that while still a young man he got to paris and began to paint in the louvre he was but nineteen at that time and his fate seemed so hard and bitter that later in life he refused to talk of those days he sat for many days in the louvre by daubignys side painting pictures for which we are told he received a dollar a yard we can think of nothing more discouraging to a genius than having to paint by the yard it is said that his poverty permitted him to sleep only every other night because he must work unceasingly and someone declares that he lived at one time on ten cents a week this is a frightful picture of poverty and distress meissoniers first paying enterprise was the painting of bonbon boxes and the decorating of fans and he tried to sell illustrations for childrens stories but for these he found no market a brilliant compiler of meissoniers life has written that his first illustrations in some unknown journal were scenes from the life of the old bachelor in the first picture he is represented making his toilet before the mirror his wig spread out on the table in the second dining with two friends in the third on his deathbed surrounded by greedy relations and in the fifth the servants ransacking the death chamber for the property this was very likely a vision of his own possible fate for meissonier must have been at that time a lonely and unhappy man there are many stories of his first exhibited work which caffin declares was the visit to the burgomaster but mrs bolton who is almost always correct in her statements tells us that it was called the visitor and that it sold for twenty dollars at the end of a six years struggle in paris his pictures were selling for no more until this artists time people had been used only to great canvases and had grown to look for fine work only in much space but here was an artist who could paint exquisitely a whole interior on a space said to be no larger than his thumb nail his work was called microscopic which meant that he gave great attention to details painting very slowly during the italian war of 1859 and in the german war of 1870 this wonderful artist was on the staff of napoleon iii during the siege of paris he held the rank of colonel and he lost no chance to learn details of battles which he might use later in making great pictures thus he gained the knowledge and inspiration to paint his picture friedland which was bought by a t stewart and is now in the metropolitan museum he himself wrote of that picture i did not intend to paint a battlei wanted to paint napoleon at the zenith of his glory i wanted to paint the love the adoration of the soldiers for the great captain in whom they had faith and for whom they were ready to die it seemed to me i did not have colours sufficiently dazzling no shade should be on the imperial face the battle already commenced was necessary to add to the enthusiasm of the soldiers and make the subject stand forth but not to diminish it by saddening details all such shadows i have avoided and presented nothing but a dismounted cannon and some growing wheat which should never ripen this was enough the men and the emperor are in the presence of each other the soldiers cry to him that they are his and the impressive chief whose imperial will directs the masses that move around salutes his devoted army he and they plainly comprehend each other and absolute confidence is expressed in every face this great work was sold at auction for 66000 and given to the metropolitan museum it is said that when he painted the retreat from russia meissonier obtained the coat which napoleon had worn at the time and had it copied crease for crease and button for button he painted the picture mostly out of doors in midwinter when the ground was covered with snow and he writes sometimes i sat at my easel for five or six hours together endeavouring to seize the exact aspect of the winter atmosphere my servant placed a hot footstove under my feet which he renewed from time to time but i used to get halffrozen and terribly tired so attentive was he to truthfulness in detail that he had a wooden horse made in imitation of the white charger of the emperor and seating himself on this he studied his own figure in a mirror at last this conscientious man was made an officer of the legion of honour having already become president of the academy edmund about writes that to cover m meissoniers pictures with gold pieces simply would be to buy them for nothing and the practice has now been established of covering them with banknotes meissonier seldom painted the figure of a woman in his pictures but all of his subjects were wholesome and fine one time an admirer said to him i envy you you can afford to own as many meissonier pictures as you please oh no i cant the distinguished artist replied that would ruin me they are a good deal too dear for me in his maturity he became very rich and his homes were dreams of beauty filled with rare possessions such as bridles of black leather once owned by murat rare silver designed by the artist himself great pictures and flowers of the rarest description besides valuable dogs and horses yet it was said that this man who lives in a palace is as moderate as a soldier on the march this artist whose canvases are valued by the halfmillion is as generous as a nabob he will give to a charity sale a picture worth the price of a house praised as he is by all he has less conceit in his nature than a wholesale painter on the 31st of january in his country house at poissy this great man whose life reads like a romance died after a short illness his funeral services were held in the madeleine and he was buried at poissy near versailles a great military procession following him to the grave plateretreat from moscow in the painting of this picture we have already told how every detail was mastered by actual experience of most of them meissonier made dozens of studies for ita horses head an uplifted leg cuirasses helmets models of horses in red wax etc he also prepared a miniature landscape strewn with white powder resembling snow with models of heavy wheels running through it that he might study the furrow made in that terrible march home from burning moscow all this workhard patient exacting work some of his other pictures are the emperor at solferino moreau and his staff before hohenlinden a reading at diderots and the chess players xxix jean franois millet fontainebleaubarbizon school 18141875 pupil of delaroche two great artists painted peasants and little else one was the artist of whom we shall speak and the other was jules breton one was realistic the other idealistic both did wonderful work but millet painted the peasant worn patient steadfast overwhelmed with toil breton a peasant full of energy grace vitality and joy millet painted peasants as he knew them and hardly any one could have known them better for he was himself peasantborn his youth was hard and the scenes of his childhood were such as in after life he became famous by painting millet lived in the department of manche in the village of gruchy near cherbourg manche juts into the sea at the english channel and whichever way millet looked he must have seen the sea his old grandmother looked after the household affairs while his father and mother worked in the fields and millet must have seen them hundreds of times standing at evening with bowed heads listening to the angelus bell he toiled too as did other lads in his position his grandmother was a religious old woman and nearly all the pictures he ever saw in his boyhood were those in the bible which he copied again and again drawing them upon the stone walls in white chalk the old grandmother watched him never doubting that her boy would become an artist it was she who had named himfranois after her favourite saint francis and it was she who beside the evening fire would tell him legends of st francis it was she alone who had time and strength left after the days work to teach him the little he learned as a boy and to fix in his mind pictures of home his father and mother were worn like packhorses after their day in the fields the mother very likely had to hitch herself up with the donkey or the big dog after the fashion of these people as she helped draw loads about the field who can look for bretons ideal stage peasants from millet who knew the truth as he saw it every day many years after his life in the gruchy home millet painted the portrait of the grandmother whom he had loved so much that he cried out i wish to paint her soul no one could desire a better reward than such a tribute millet had an uncle who was a priest and he did what he could to give the boy a start in learning he taught him to read virgil and the latin testament and all his life those two books were millets favourites besides drawing pictures on the walls of his home he drew them on his sabots pity some one did not preserve those old wooden shoes he did his share of the farm work doing his drawing on rainy days when he was about eighteen years old coming from mass one day he was impressed with the figure of an old man going along the road and taking some charcoal from his pocket he drew the picture of him on a stone wall the villagers passing at once knew the likeness they were pleased and told millet so old millet the father also was delighted for he too had wished to be an artist but fate had been against him seeing the wonderful things his son could do he decided that he should become what he himself had wished to be and that he should go to cherbourg to study franois set off with his father carrying a lot of sketches to show and upon telling the master in cherbourg what he wanted and showing the sketches he was encouraged to stay and begin study in earnest so back the old father went with the news to the mother and grandmother and the priest uncle that franois had begun his career he stayed in cherbourg studying till his father died when he thought it right to go home and do the work his father had always done he returned but the womenfolk would not agree to him staying you go back at once said the grandmother and stick to your art we shall manage the farm she sewed up in his belt all the money she had saved and started him off again for he had then been studying only two months now he remained till he was twentythree a fine strapping broadshouldered country fellow he had long fair hair and piercing dark blue eyes all the time he was with delaroche he was dissatisfied with his workand with his masters which seemed to millet artificial untrue he knew nothing of the classical figures the master painted and wished him to paint for his heart and mind were back in gruchy among the scenes that bore a meaning for him he wished to study elsewhere and by this time he had done so well that one of the artists with whom he had studied went to the mayor of millets home town and begged him to furnish through the towncouncil money enough to send millet to paris this was done and millet began to hope he was very shy and afraid of seeming awkward and out of place the night he got to paris was snowy full of confusion and strange things to him and an awful loneliness overwhelmed him the next morning he set out to find the louvre but would not ask his way for fear of seeming absurd to some one so that he rambled about alone looking for the great gallery till he found it unaided he spent most of the days that followed gazing in ecstasy at the pictures he liked angelo titian and rubens best he had come to paris to enter a studio but he put off his entrance from day to day for his shyness was painful and he feared above all things to be laughed at by city students at last one day he got up enough courage to apply to delaroche whose studio he had decided to enter if he could as he liked his work best the students in that studio were full of curiosity about the new chap with his peasant air his bushy hair and great frame so sturdy and awkward they at once nicknamed him the man of the woods and they nagged at him and laughed at the idea that he could learn to paint till one day exasperated nearly to death he shook his fist at them from that moment he heard no more from them for they were certain that if he could not paint he could use his fists a good deal better than any of them delaroche liked the peasant but did not understand him very well and millet was not too fond of his painting so after two years he and a friend withdrew from that studio and set up one for themselves thus eight years passed the friends living from hand to mouth doing all sorts of things signpainting advertisements and the like and millet in the midst of his poverty got married he went home returning to paris with his wife and after starving regularly he became desperate enough to paint a single picture as he wished it seemed at the time the maddest kind of thing to do who would see ugly toilworn peasants upon his salon walls paris wanted dainty aesthetic art and an academy artist would have scoffed at the idea but the millets were starving anyway so why not starve doing at least what one chose so millet painted his first wonderful peasant picture the winnower and just as the family were starving he sold itfor 100 he had done at last the right thing in doing as he pleased this was a sign to him that there was after all a place for truth and emotion in art but the millets must change their place of living and go to some place where the money made would not at once be eaten up jacquethe friend with whom millet had set up shop and who also became famous lateradvised them to go to a little place he knew about which had a name ending in zon it was near the forest of fontainebleau he said and they could live there very cheaply and it was quiet and decent the millets got into a rumbling old cart and started in search of the place which ended in zon near the forest of fontainebleau jacque had also decided to take his family there and they all went together when they got to fontainebleau they got down from the car and went afoot through the forest they arrived tired and hungry toward evening and went to gannes inn where there were rousseau diaz and other artists who like themselves had come in search of a nice clean picturesque place in which to starve if they had to those who were just sitting down to supper welcomed the newcomers for they had been there long enough to form a colony and fraternity ways one of these was to take a certain great pipe from the wall and ask the newcomer to smoke and according to the way he blew his rings he was pronounced a colourist or classicist the two friends blew the smoke and at once the other artists were able to place jacque he was a colourist but what were they to say about millet who blew rings after his own fashion oh well he cried dont trouble about it just put me down in a class of my own a good answer diaz answered and he looks strong and big enough to hold his own in it thus the newcomers took their places in the life of barbizonthe place whose name ended in zon and millets real work began his first wife lived only two years but he married again all this time he was following his conscience in the matter of his work and selling almost nothing in a letter to a friend he tells how dreadfully poor they are although his new wife was the most devoted helpful woman imaginable known far and near as mre millet the artist wrote to sensier his friend who aided him i have received the hundred francs they came just at the right time neither my wife nor i had tasted food in twentyfour hours it is a blessing that the little ones at any rate have not been in want the revolution of 1848 had come before millet went to barbizon and he like other men had to go to war then the cholera appeared and these things interrupted his work and after such troubles people did not begin buying pictures at once rousseau was famous now but millet lived by the hardest toil until one day he sold the woodcutter to rousseau himself for four hundred francs rousseau had been very poor and it grieved him to see the trials and want of his friend so he pretended that he was buying the picture for an american that picture was later sold at the hartmann sale for 133000 francs millet was now forty years old and had not yet been recognised as a wonderful man by any but his brother artists he was truly in a class of his own he had learned to love barbizon and cried better a thatched cottage here than a palace in paris and we have the picture in our minds of millet followed patiently and lovingly by mre millet in the peasant dress which she always wore that she might be ready at a moments notice to pose for his figures then there were his little children and his sunny simple fraternal surroundings which make his life the most picturesque of all artists his paintings had the simplest stories with seldom more than two or three figures in them it was said that he needed only a field and a peasant to make a great picture when he painted the man with the hoe he did it so truthfully in a way to make the story so well understood by all who looked upon it that he was called a socialist no one was so much surprised as millet by that name i never dreamed of being a leader in any cause he said i am a peasantonly a peasant of his picture the reaper a critic wrote he might have reaped the whole earth all his pictures were sermons he called them epics of the fields he pretended to nothing except to present things just as they were as he writes in a letter to a friend about the water carrier in the woman coming from drawing water i have endeavoured that she shall be neither a watercarrier nor a servant but the woman who has just drawn water for the house the water for her husbands and her childrens soup that she shall seem to be carrying neither more nor less than the weight of the full buckets that beneath the sort of grimace which is natural on account of the strain on her arms and the blinking of her eyes caused by the light one may see a look of rustic kindliness on her face i have always shunned with a kind of horror everything approaching the sentimental i have desired on the other hand that this woman should perform simply and goodnaturedly without regarding it as irksome an act which like her other household duties is one she is accustomed to perform every day of her life also i wanted to make people imagine the freshness of the fountain and that its antiquated appearance should make it clear that many before her had come to draw water from it at forty he was in about the same condition as he had been on that evening ten or twelve years before when he had entered barbizon carrying his two little daughters upon his shoulders his wife following with the servant and a basket of food to settle themselves down to hardship made sweet by kind comradeship and hope now a change came millet painted the angelus he was dreadfully poor at that time and sold the picture cheaply but it laid the foundation of his fame and fortune he had worked upon the canvas till he said he could hear the sound of the bell although its first purchaser paid very little for it it has since been sold for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars at last having struggled through his worst days without recognition and with nine little children to feed and clothe he was given the white cross of the legion of honour and as if to make up for the days of his starvation he was nearly feasted to death in paris he was placed upon the hanging committee of the salon and took a dignified place among artists he and mre millet travelled a little but always he returned to barbizon till the war came and he had to move to normandy to work afterward he returned to barbizon to the scenes and the old friends he loved so well and there he died he had come back ill and tired with the long struggle and he instructed his friends to give him a simple funeral this was done they carried his coffin while his wife and children walked beside him to the cemetery and he was buried near the little church of chailly whose spire is seen in the angelas and where rousseau whom he loved had already been laid there in barbizon today may be seen rousseaus cottage and millets studio the peasants sow and reap and glean as in the days of millet troyons oxen and sheep are still standing in the meadow jacques poultry are feeding in the barnyard the leaves on rousseaus grand old trees are trembling in the forest corots misty morning is as fresh and soft as ever while diazs ruddy sunsets still penetrate the branches and the peasant pauses daily as the angelus from the chailly church calls him to silent prayer platethe angelus in the angelus you may see faroff the spire of the church at chailly from which the bell sounds the days work is drawing to a close the peasant man and woman have been digging potatoesthe man uncovering them while his wife has been putting them in the basket as the angelus floats across the fields the two pause and bow their heads in prayer the man has dropped his fork and uncovered his head and his wife has clasped her hands devoutly before her all the air seems still and full of tender sound and colour and we like millet seem to hear the bell this is the only picture he painted which is full of the sentimentality he so much disliked it is a great picture but we need to know the title in order to interpret it besides this one millet painted the gleaners the woodcutters the sower the man with the hoe the water carrier the reaper and many other stories of the peasant poor xxx claude monet pronounced claude monay impressionist school of france 1840 anothermanetwas the founder of this school among modern painters but monet is always considered his most conspicuous follower monets remarkable method of putting his colours upon canvas does not mean impressionism he is an impressionist but also monetan artist with a method entirely different from that of any other he belongs to what in france is called the pointillistes the word means nothing more nor less than an effort to accomplish the impossible if you stand a little way from a very hot stove you may be able to see a kind of movement in the air a quivering of particles or molecular motion and this is what the pointillistes try to show in their paintingsmonet most of all the theory is that by putting little dabs of primitive colours close together upon canvas without mixing them just separate dabs of red yellow blue etc the effect of movement is produced needless to say none of them ever have produced such an effect but they have made such grotesque ugly pictures that they have attracted attention even as a humpbacked person does the first who painted thus was a frenchman named seurat who tried it after closely studying experiments made in light and colour by professor rood of columbia university after him came pissarro and then monet america also has such a painter childe hassam but nobody is so grotesque as monet he was born in paris but spent most of his youth in havre where he met a painter of harbours and shipping scenes called boudin through his influence monet studied outofdoor effects and was beginning to do fairly good work when he was drawn as a conscript and sent to algeria it is written that monet discovered that green seen under strong sunshine is not green but yellow that the shadows cast by sunlight upon snow or upon brightly lighted surfaces are not black but blue and that a white dress seen under the shade of trees on a bright day has violet or lilac tones this only means that these things have been scientifically determined not that the naked eye ever perceives them and it is for the natural unscientific eye that art exists none of us see the separate colours of the spectrum as we look about in everyday fashion upon everyday objects professor rood managed to produce an intelligent effect by putting separate colours on discs and whirling these round so that the colours mingled monet tried to do the same by dotting his original colours close together and leaving the picture to its own destruction it ought to revolve if the scientific idea is to be carried out nothing desirable can be made out of his pictures even when viewed from far off while at close range they are simply grotesque and photographs of them give the impression that the entire landscape is wabbling to the ground i wonder if anyone small or grown up can understand this it was indeed a higher kind of impressionism that monet originated one that reveals a vivid rendering not of the natural and concrete facts but of their influence upon the spirit when they are wrapped in the infinite diversities of that impalpable immaterial universal medium which we call light when the concrete loses itself in the abstract and what is of time and matter impinges on the eternal and the universal monets pictures look just as that explanation of them sounds the same writer says that monet was greater than corot because he was more sensitive to colour but if monet had been as sensitive to colour as corot he could not have lived and looked at his own pictures platehaystack in sunshine the main feature of this picture is such a hay stack as never existed anywhere of indescribable lurid colour against a background of blue such as never was seen all about there are violet and rosecoloured trees and it is a picture that every child should know because he is likely never to have another such opportunity monet has made two interesting pictures of churches one at vernon the other at varangeville xxxi murillo bartolome esteban pronounced mooreeloh bartolomay astaybahn andalusian school 16171682 pupil of juan del castillo the story of murillo has been delightfully told by mrs sarah bolton like velasquez he was born in seville a city called the glory of the spanish realms and was baptised on new years day 1618 in the church of the magdalen murillos father paid his rent in work instead of in money he made a bargain with the convent who owned his house that he would keep it in repair if he might have it free of rent so there gaspar estban and his wife maria perez settled perez was the family name of murillos mother who had very good connections one of her brothers juan del castillo being a man who encouraged all art and had an art school of his own little murillo therefore had encouragement from the start an unusual circumstance at a time when parents rarely wished to think of their sons as painters as a matter of fact his mother would have preferred that he should become a priest but she was kind and sensible and put no difficulties in the way of the little murillo doing as he wished the story goes that the perez family had been very rich but however it may have been that was not the case when the artist was born one day after his mother had gone to church murillo being left at home alone retouched a picture that hung upon the wall it was a picture of sacred subjectjesus and the lamb he thought he could make some improvements in it so he painted his own hat upon the head of jesus and changed the lamb into a little dog his mother was a good deal shocked at what seemed to her an irreligious act though it showed the family genius after that the boy was found to be painting upon the walls of his schoolroom and making sketches upon the margins of his books though he did little else at school he had one sister therese and they were left without father or mother before the artist was eleven years old it was at that time that he received the name of murillo by which he is known it came about thus after the death of his parents he went to live with his mothers sister the doa anna murillo who had married a surgeon called juan agustin lagares and since the little artist was to live with his aunt he soon became known by her family name there in her home he and his sister therese were brought up but he was not to become a surgeon like his uncleinlaw but an artist like his uncle juan the teacher in seville that uncle took him in hand taught the boy to draw to mix colours to stretch his canvas and soon murillos genius won the love of master and pupils in peace and reasonable comfort he served a nine years apprenticeship and painted his first important if not especially great pictures these were two madonnas one of them the story of the rosary st dominic had instituted the rosary using fifteen large and one hundred and fifty small beads upon which to keep record of the number of prayers he had said the large beads representing the paternosters and glorias and the small ones the aves this practical way of indicating duties helped the heedless to concentrate their attention and did much to increase the number of prayers offered indeed it is said that by this single expedient dominic did more to excite the devotion of the lower orders especially of the women and made more converts than by all his orthodoxy learning arguments and eloquence it was this incident in the history of the catholic church that murillo commemorated when the artist was twentytwo years old his uncle juan del castillo broke up his home and went elsewhere to live leaving the artist without home or means and with his little sister to take care of without vanity or ambition but with only the wish to care for his sister and to get food the marvellous painter took himself to the market place and there wedged in between stalls old clothes vegetables all sorts of wares like a wanderer and a gypsy he began his career at the weekly marketthe feria or fair opposite the church of all saintshis brotherly kindly feeling for the vagabonds he daily met is shown in the treatment he gives them in his wonderful pictures during the two years that he worked in that openair studio he had flowergirls muleteers hucksters all about him and he painted dozens of rough pictures which found quick sale among the patrons of the market what velasquez was doing in the court of madrid murillo was doing in the streets of seville the one painting cardinals kings and courtiers the other painting beggars gamins and waifs between the two the world has been shown the social history of spain as it then existed through a peculiar happening the american indian saw the beauties of murillos work before europe was even conscious there was such a man in his old home his uncles studio murillo had had a dear comrade moya they had not met for two years or more and when they did come together again moya told murillo he had been travelling that he had been to flanders with the spanish army and thence to london in both places seeing gorgeous paintings and other inspiring things he opened the eyes of murillo to the splendours the world contained and the artist became wild with desire to go and see them for himself but he had no money he was painting pictures in the market place of seville and getting so little for his hasty work that he could barely support himself and little therese what must he do in order to get to london and see the world what he did do was to buy a piece of linen cut it into six pieces and hide himself long enough to paint upon them saints flowers fruit and landscapes and then he went forth to sell them he actually sold those pictures to a shipowner who was sending his ship to the west indies eventually they were hung upon the walls of a mission in wild far off america it is said that after this murillo made no little money by painting such pictures destined to give the american savage an idea of the christian religion one cannot but wonder if there may not be all unknown to us murillo pictures made in the marketplace of seville nearly three hundred years ago hidden away in the remains of those old spanish missions even today such a picture would be more rare than the greatest that he ever painted after selling his six pictures murillo started afoot not to london but on a terrible journey across the sierra mountains to madridthe home of velasquez murillo knew that this native of seville had become a famous artist he was powerful and rich and at the court of philip ii while murillo had no place to lay his head and besides he had left therese behind in seville in the care of friends he had no claim upon the kindness of velasquez but he determined to see him to introduce himself and possibly to gain a friend it was under these forlorn circumstances he made himself known to the great spanish court painter the story of their meeting is a fine one for murillo velasquez had a warm embrace a kind and hospitable word the stranger told velasquez how he had crossed the mountains on foot was penniless but could use his brush instead of jealousy and suspicion the young man met with nothing but the most cheerful encouragement found the velasquez home open to him took up his lodging there and established his workshop with nothing around him but friendship and the sympathy his nature craved from the marketplace to the home of velasquez and the palace of philip ii it was a beautiful dream to murillo with what splendour of colour and mastery of design he illuminated the annals of the poor coming forth from some dim chancel or palacehall in which he had been working on a majestic madonna picture he would sketch in with the brush still loaded with the colours of celestial glory the lineaments of the beggar crouching by the wall or the gypsy calmly reposing in the black shadow of an archway such versatility had never before been seen west of the mediterranean and it commanded the admiration of his countrymen all his beggarly little children neglected and houseless appeared only to be full of cheer and merriment with soft eyes and contented faces it was a happy carefree gay and kindly beggardom that he painted with nothing in it to sadden the heart thus he lived for three years working in the galleries of the king making friends at court painting beautiful women gallant cavaliers and fascinating little beggars in the course of time however he grew restless and velasquez wished to give him letters of introduction to roman artists and people of quality advising him to go to rome to study the greatest art in the world this was an alluring plan to murillo but after all he longed for his own home and chose to return there rather than go to rome besides his sister therese was still in seville once more in his home at one stroke of his magic brush murillo raised himself and a monastic order from obscurity to greatness in his native city was the order of san francisco the monks had long wished to have their convent decorated in a worthy manner by some artist of repute but they were poor and had never been able to engage such a painter when murillo got back home he was as badly in need of work as the franciscans were in want of an artist the monks held a council and finally agreed upon a price which they could pay and which murillo could live upon then he began a wonderful set of eleven large paintings among them were many saints dark and rich in colouring and no sooner was it known that the paintings were being made than all the rich and powerful people of seville flocked to the convent to see the work they gathered about the young artist overwhelmed him with honours and praise and the monastery was crowded from morning till night with those who wished to study his work from that moment murillos fame if not his fortune was made he married a rich and noble lady with the tremendous name of doa beatriz de cabrera y sotomayer he had fallen in love with her while painting her as an angel about that time he formed a strange partnership with a landscape painter who agreed to supply the backgrounds that his pictures needed if murillo would paint figures into his landscapes this plan did very well for a little time but it did not last long murillo painted in three distinct styles and these have come to be known as the warm the cold and the vaporous he painted pictures in the great cathedral of the escorial and the guardian angel was one of them also he painted st anthony of padua and of this picture there is one of those absurd stories meant to illustrate the perfection of art it is said that the lilies in it are so natural that the birds flew down the cathedral aisles to pluck at them many artists have painted this saint but murillos is the best picture of all when the nephew of his first master murillos cousin saw that work he said it is all over with castillo is it possible that murillo that servile imitator of my uncle can be the author of all this grace and beauty of colouring the duke of wellington offered for this picture as many gold pieces as would cover its surface of fifteen square feet this would have been about two hundred and forty thousand dollars but we need not imagine that murillo received any such sum for the work this picture has a further interesting history the canvas was cut from the frame by thieves in 1874 and later it was sold to mr schaus the connoisseur and picture dealer of new york he paid 250 for it and at once put it into the hands of the spanish consul who restored it to the cathedral the story of the saint whom murillo painted is as interesting as murillos own among the many wonderful things said to have happened to him was that a congregation of fishes hearing his voice as he preached beside the sea came to the top and lifted up their heads to listen while murillo was doing his work he was living a happy domestic life he had three children and doubtless he used them as models for his lively cherubs as he used his wifes face for madonnas and angels he founded an academy of painting in seville for the entrance to which a student could not qualify unless he made the following declaration praised be the most holy sacrament and the pure conception of our lady the most delightful stories are told of murillos kindness and sweetness of disposition he had a slave who loved him and who one day while murillo was gone from the studio painted in the head of the virgin which the master had left incomplete when murillo returned and saw the excellent work he cried i am fortunate sebastianthe slaves namefor i have not created only pictures but an artist this slave was set free by murillo and in the course of time he painted many splendid pictures which are today highly prized in seville this is a description of murillos house which is still to be seen near the church of santa cruz the courtyard contains a marble fountain amidst flowering shrubs and is surrounded on three sides by an arcade upheld by marble pillars at the rear is a pretty garden shaded by cypress and citron trees and terminated by a wall whereon are the remains of ancient frescoes which have been attributed to the master himself the studio is on the upper floor and overlooks the moorish battlements commanding a beautiful view to the eastward over orange groves and rich cornlands out to the gray highlands about alcala murillos fame brought fortune to his little sister therese she married a nobleman of burgos a knight of santiago and judge of the royal colonial court he became the chief secretary of state for madrid murillo made money but gave almost all that he made to the poor though he did not make money in the service of the church as velasquez made it in the service of the king his work of more than twenty pictures in the capuchin church of seville occupied him for three years and in that time he did not leave the convent for a single day of all the charming stories told of this glorious artist one which is connected with his work in that church is the most picturesque it seems that every one within the walls loved him and among others a lay brother who was cook this man begged for some little personal token from murillo and since there was no canvas at hand the artist bade the cook leave the napkin which he had brought to cover his food and during the day he painted upon it a madonna and child so natural that one of his biographers declares the child seems about to spring from marys arms this souvenir made for the cook of the capuchin convent has been reproduced again and again as one of the artists greatest performances toward the close of his happy life he became more and more devout spending many hours before an altarpiece in the church of santa cruz where was a picture of the descent from the cross by pedro campana why do you always tarry before the descent from the cross the sacristan once asked of him i am waiting till those men have brought the body of our blessed lord down the ladder murillo answered his wife had died his daughter had become a nun and all that was left to him was his dear son gaspar when in his sixtythird year he began his last work the marriage of st catherine he had not finished this when he fell from the scaffolding upon which he was working and fatally hurt himself he died with his son beside him he was a much loved man and when he was buried his bier was carried by two marquises and four knights and followed by a great concourse of people he chose to be buried beneath the picture he loved so muchthe descent from the cross and upon his grave was laid a stone carved with his name a skeleton and an inscription in latin which means live as one who is about to die the church has since been destroyed and on its site is the plaza santa cruz but murillos grave is marked by a tablet each country seems to have had at least one man of beautiful heart and mind to represent its art raphael in italy murillo in spain were types of gentle and greatly beloved men leonardo in italy and drer in nuremberg were types of forceful intellectual men highly respected and of great benefit to the world of all the painters who ever lived murillo was the one who painted little children with the most loving and fascinating touch platethe immaculate conception besides the little angels in this picture we have a bewildering choice among many other beauties many pictures of this subject have been painted and many were painted by murillo but the one presented here is the greatest of all it hangs in the louvre salle vi mary seems to be suspended in the heavens not standing upon clouds under the hem of her garments is the circle of the moon while there is the effect of hundreds of little cherub children massed about her feet in a little swarm at the right where the shadow falls heaviest and still others half lost in the vapoury background at the left where the heavenly light streams upon them and brilliantly lights up the virgins gown in this picture are all murillos beloved child figures some carrying little streamers their tiny wings aflutter and all crowding lovingly about mary far below this gorgeous group we can imagine the dark and weary earth lost in shadow among murillos most famous paintings are the birth of the virgin two beggar boys the madonna of the rosary the annunciation adoration of the shepherds holy family education of mary the dice players and the vision of st anthony xxxii raphael sanzio pronounced rahfayel sahntsyoh 14831590 umbrian florentine and roman schools pupil of perugino it was said of raphael that every evil humour vanished when his comrades saw him every low thought fled from their minds and this was because they felt themselves vanquished by his pleasant ways and sweet nature imagine his beautiful face with its sunny eyes reflecting no shadow of sadness or pain such a one was sure to be beloved by all the father of raphael was giovanni santi himself an able artist both he and raphael studied in many schools and took the best from each the son was brought up in an italian court that of guidobaldo of urbino where the father was a favourite poet and painter so that he had at least one generation of artlovers behind him at a time when learning and art were much prized nothing ever entered into his life that was sad or sorrowful his whole existence was a triumph of beautiful achievements there were three great artists of that time the other two being michael angelo and leonardo da vinci both of whom were absolutely unlike raphael in their art and in their characters raphael was born on april 6th at contrada del monte in the ducal city of urbino his mothers name was magia ciarla and she was the daughter of an urbino merchant she had three children besides the great painter all of whom died young and when raphael was but eight years old his mother died also it is said that it was from her raphael inherited his beauty goodness mildness and genius his fathers patron the duke of urbino was a fine soldier but he also cherished scholarship and art and kept at his court not less than twenty or thirty persons at work copying greek and latin manuscript which he wished to add to his library raphael had a stepmother bernardina the daughter of a goldsmith a good and forceful woman but not gentle like the first wife and when raphael was eleven years of age his father too died by his fathers will raphael became the charge of his uncle bartolommeo a priest but the property was left to the stepmother so long as she remained unmarried almost at once the priest and the stepmother fell to quarreling over the spoils and thus raphael was left pretty much to his own devices but just when life began to look dark and sad for him his mothers brother took a hand in the situation he settled the dispute between the priest and the second wife and arranged that raphael should be placed in the studio of some great painter for the loving lad had already worked in his fathers studio and had given promise of his wonderful gifts so he became the pupil of perugino a painter noted for his fine colouring and sympathetic handling of his subjects at that time italian schools were less wonderful in colouring than in other matters of technique let him become my pupil said perugino when raphael was brought to him and some of his work was exhibited soon he will be my master a very different attitude from that of ghirlandajo toward michael angelo raphael and his master became friends and worked together for nine years his first work was not conceived until raphael was seventeen it was to be a surprise to his master who had gone to florence a banner was wanted for the church of s trinita at citta di castello and raphael undertook it painting the trinity on one canvas and the creation of man on another then he painted the crucifixion which was bought by cardinal fesch who lived in rome that painting is now in a collection of the earl of dudley it was sold away from rome in 1845 for twelve thousand dollarsor a little more no one will deny that this is an unusual sum for an artists first work but about the same time he did a much more wonderful thing he painted a little picture six and threequarter inches square it was of the virgin walking in the springtime before the leaves had appeared upon the trees and with snowcapped mountains behind her she holds the infant jesus in her arms while she reads from a small book and the little child looks upon the page with her this six inches of beauty sold to the emperor of russia in 1871 for sixty thousand dollars before raphael was twentyone he had left his masters studio and had gone into the splendid world of rome where angelo was straining at his bonds but how differently each accepted his life the gentle raphael who took the best of the ideas of all great painters and gave to them his own exquisite characteristics was beloved of all shed light upon art and friends alike to such a one all life was joyous michael angelo trying ever to do the impossible betraying his hatred of limitations in all that he did doing always that which aroused horror distress longing elemental feelings in those who studied his wonderful work and giving hope and satisfaction and peace to noneto such as he life must ever have been hateful and painful these men lived at the same time among the same people one of raphaels greatest pictures came into the possession of a poor widow who being hard pressed by poverty sold it to a bookseller for twelve scudi in time it was bought from the bookseller by grand duke ferdinand iii of tuscany who prayed before it night and morning taking it with him on his travels that picture is now in the pitti palace at florence and it is called the madonna del granduca the berlin museum purchased a raphael madonna for 34000 which was painted about the same time as these others but after a little the artist left florence where he had been studying the methods of leonardo and angelo and returned to urbino the home he loved where his conduct was such that all the world seems to have become his lover it is written that he was the only very distinguished man of whom we read who lived and died without an enemy or detractor no better can ever be said of any one while he dwelt in perugia and urbino he had painted the ansidei madonna so called because that was the name of the family for which it was painted that madonna was sold in 1884 to the national gallery by the duke of marlborough for 350000 a madonna on a round plaquelike canvas 4234 inches in diameter was bought by the duke of bridgewater for 60000 it is the holy family under a palm tree painted originally for a friend taddeo taddei who was a florentine scholar many of the pictures which after many vicissitudes have landed far from home and been bought for fabulous sums were painted for love of some friend or were paid for by modest sums at the time the artist received the commissions lord ellesmere in london now owns the holy family under a palm tree it is said of raphael that whenever another painter known to him or not requested any design or assistance of any kind at his hands he would invariably leave his work to perform the service he continually kept a large number of artists employed all of whom he assisted and instructed with an affection which was rather that of a father to his children than merely of an artist to artists from this it followed that he was never seen to go to court except surrounded and accompanied as he left his house by some fifty painters all men of ability and distinction who attended him thus to give evidence of the honour in which they held him he did not in short live the life of a painter but that of a prince there is something wonderfully inspiring about such a life we read of emperors and the homage paid to them of the esteem in which men who accomplish deeds of universal value are held but nowhere do we behold the power of a beautiful and exquisite personality and character allied with a single art so impressively exhibited he urged nothing yet won all things by the force of his loving and sympathetic mind how is it dear cesare that we live in such good friendship but that in the art of painting we show no deference to each other he asked of cesare da sesto who was da vincis greatest pupil in discussing the great ones of the earth herman grimm son of the collector of fairy tales says can we mention a violent act of raphaels goethes or shakespeares no it is restful only to recall these wonderful men one of raphaels most beautiful virgins was modeled from a beautiful flowergirl whom he loved la belle jardinire raphael as well as michael angelo was summoned by pope julius ii but how different were the two occasions michael angelo had stood with dogged gloomy selfassertiveness before the pope head covered knee unbent uncompromising while yet no injury had been done him resentful before he had received a single cause for resentment the attitude was typical of his art and his unhappy life when raphael appeared his bent knee his chestnut locks falling upon his shoulders the pope exclaimed he is an innocent angel i will give him cardinal bembo for a teacher and he shall fill my walls with historical pictures the artists behaviour was no sign of servility but the simple recognition of forms and customs which the people themselves had made and by which they had decided they should graciously be bound the attitude of angelo was not heroic but vulgar that of raphael not servile but in good taste showing a reasonable mind pope julius had summoned raphael for a special reason alexander vi his predecessor in the vatican had been a depraved man the fair and virile julius had a healthy sentiment against occupying rooms which must continually remind him of the notorious alexanders mode of life some one suggested that he have all the portraits of the former pope removed but julius declared even if the portraits were destroyed the walls themselves would remind me of that simoniac that jew the word jew was then execrated by all christians for the world was not yet christian enough to know better raphael was summoned to decorate the vatican that julius might have a place which reminded him not at all of alexander it is said that when raphael had completed one of his masterpieces the pope threw himself upon the ground and cried i thank thee god that thou hast sent me so great a painter while at work upon his first fresco at the vaticanla disputa the dispute over the holy sacramentraphael met a woman with whom he fell deeply in love her father was a soda manufacturer and her name was margherita missirini relates this incident in raphaels career she lived on the other side of the tiber a small house no 20 in the street of santa dorothea the windows of which are decorated with a pretty frame work of earthenware is pointed out as the house where she was born the beautiful girl was very frequently in a little garden adjoining the house where the wall not being very high it was easy to see her from the outside so the young men especially artistsalways passionate admirers of beautydid not fail to come and look at her by climbing up above the wall raphael is said to have seen her for the first time as she was bathing her pretty feet in a little fountain in the garden struck by her perfect beauty he fell deeply in love with her and after having made acquaintance with her and discovered that her mind was as beautiful as her body he became so much attached as to be unable to live without her she is spoken of today as the fornarina because at first she was supposed to have been the daughter of a baker fornajo raphael made many rough studies for his picture la disputa and upon them he left three sonnets written to the woman so dear to him these sonnets have been translated by the librarian of lecole nationale des beauxarts as follows love thou hast bound me with the light of two eyes which torment me with a face like snow and roses with sweet words and tender manners so great is my ardour that no river or sea could extinguish my fire but i do not complain for my ardour makes me happy how sweet was the chain how light the yoke of her white arms about my neck when these bonds were loosed i felt a mortal grief i will say no more a great joy kills and though my thoughts turn to thee i will keep silence although he had been a man of many loves raphael must have found in the manufacturers daughter his best love because he remained faithful and devoted to her for the twelve years of life that were left to him it was said some years later while he was engaged upon a commission for a rich banker that raphael was so much occupied with the love that he bore to the lady of his choice that he could not give sufficient attention to his work agostino the banker therefore falling at length into despair of seeing it finished made so many efforts by means of friends and by his own care that after much difficulty he at length prevailed on the lady to take up her abode in his house where she was accordingly installed in apartments near those which raphael was painting in this manner the work was ultimately brought to a conclusion raphael painted this beautiful ladylove many times and in a picture in which she wears a bracelet he has placed his name upon the ornament after this time he painted the madonna della casa dalba which the duchess dalba gave to her physician for curing her of a grave disorder she died soon afterward and the physician was arrested on the charge of having poisoned her in course of time the picture was purchased for 70000 by the russian emperor and it is now in the hermitage st petersburg a writer telling of that time relates the following anecdote raphael of urbino had painted for agostino chigi the rich banker already mentioned at santa maria della pace some prophets and sibyls on which he had received an advance of five hundred scudi one day he demanded of agostinos cashier giulio borghesi the remainder of the sum at which he estimated his work the cashier being astounded at this demand and thinking that the sum already paid was sufficient did not reply cause the work to be estimated by a judge of painting replied raphael and you will see how moderate my demand is giulio borghesi thought of michael angelo for this valuation and begged him to go to the church and estimate the figures of raphael possibly he imagined that selflove rivalry and jealousy would lead the florentine to lower the price of the pictures michael angelo went accompanied by the cashier to santa maria della pace and as he was contemplating the fresco without uttering a word borghesi questioned him that head replied michael angelo pointing to one of the sibyls that head is worth a hundred scudi and the others asked the cashier the others are not less someone who witnessed this scene related it to chigi he heard every particular and offering in addition to the five hundred scudi for five heads a hundred scudi to be paid for each of the others he said to his cashier go and give that to raphael in payment for his heads and behave very politely to him so that he may be satisfied for if he insists on my paying also for the drapery we should probably be ruined by the time raphael was thirtyone he was a rich man and had built himself a beautiful house near the vatican on the via di borgo nuova naught remains of that dwelling except an angle of the right basement which has been made a part of the accoramboni palace his friends wished him above all things to marry but he was still true to margherita though he had become engaged to the daughter of his nephew he put the marriage off year after year till finally the lady he was to have married died and was buried in raphaels chapel in the pantheon margherita was with him when he died and it was to her that he left much of his wealth in the time of raphael excavations were being made about rome and many beautiful statues uncovered and he was charged with the supervision of this work in order that no art treasure should be lost or overlooked the pope decreed that if the excavators failed to acquaint raphael with every stone and tablet that should he unearthed they should be fined from one to three hundred gold crowns raphael had his many paintings copied under his own eye and engraved and then distributed broadcast so that not only men of great wealth but the common people might study them henry viii invited him to visit england and become court painter and francis i wished him to become the court painter of france he loved history and wished to write certain historical works he loved poetry and wrote it he loved philosophy and lived itthe philosophy of generous feeling and kindly thought for all the world he kept poor artists in his own home and provided for them raphael died on good friday night april 6th in his thirtyseventh year and all rome wept he lay in state in his beautiful home with his unfinished picture of the transfiguration as background for his catafalque that painting with its colours still wet was carried in the procession to his burial place in the pantheon when his death was announced the pope leo x wept and cried ora pro nobis while the ambassador from mantua wrote home that nothing is talked of here but the loss of the man who at the close of his sixandthirtieth year has now ended his first life his second that of his posthumous fame independent of death and transitory things through his works and in what the learned will write in his praise must continue forever raphael painted two hundred and eightyseven pictures in his thirtyseven years of life platethe sistine madonna it is said that the sistine madonna while painted from an italian modeldoubtless the lady whom raphael so dearly lovedhas universal characteristics so that she may be understood by everyone he lived only three years after painting this picture and it was the last holy family painted by him the madonna stands upon a curve of the earth which is scarcely to be seen and looming mistily in front of her is a mass of white vaporous clouds on either side are figures st sixtus for whom the picture was named and st barbara beside st sixtus we see a crown or tiara and the little tower at st barbaras side is a part of her story barbara was the daughter of an eastern nobleman who feared that her great beauty might lead to her being carried off therefore he caused her to be shut up in a great tower while thus imprisoned barbara became a christian through the influence of a holy man and she begged her father to make three windows in her gloomy tower one to let the light of the father stream upon her another to admit the light of the son and the third that she might bathe in the light of the holy ghost both st barbara and st sixtus were martyrs for their faith this madonna is painted as if enclosed by green velvet curtains which have been drawn aside letting the golden light of the picture blaze upon the one who looks then upon a little ledge below looking out from the heavens are two little cherubsknown to all the world they look wistful wise roguish and beautiful with fat little arms resting comfortably upon the ledge raphael is said to have found his models for these little angels in the street leaning wistfully upon the ledge of a bakers window looking at the good things to eat which were within raphael took them put wings to them placed them at the feet of mary and made two little images which have brought smiles and tears to a multitude of people the sistine madonna hangs alone in a room in the dresden gallery among raphaels greatest works are the madonna della sedia of the chair la belle jardinire the school of athens saint cecilia the transfiguration death of ananias a cartoon for a series of tapestries madonna del pesce la disputa the marriage of mary and joseph st george slaying the dragon st michael attacking satan and the coronation of the virgin xxxiii rembrandt van rijn dutch school 16061669 pupil of van swanenburch here are a few of the titles that have been given to the greatest dutch painter that ever lived the shakespeare of painting the prince of etchers the king of shadows the painter of painters muther calls him a hero from cloudland and not only does he alone wear these titles of greatness but he alone in his family had the name of rembrandt one writer has said that the great painter was born in a windmill but this is not true he was born in leyden for certain though not a great deal is known about his youth and his father was a miller his mother a bakers daughter when the pilgrim fathers who had sought safety in leyden were starting for america where they were going to oppress others as they had been oppressed rembrandt was just beginning his apprenticeship in art he was born at no 3 weddesteg a house on the rampart looking out upon the rhine whose two arms meet there in front of it whirled the great arms of his fathers windmill though he was not born in it and of all the women rembrandt ever knew it is not likely that he ever admired or loved one as passionately as he admired and loved his mother he painted and etched her again and again with a touch so tender that his deepest emotion is placed before us rembrandt had brothers and sistersfive adriaen gerrit machteld cornelis and willem of these adriaen became a miller like his father and presumably the old historic windmill fell to him willem became a baker but rembrandt the fourth child it was determined should be a learned man and belong to one of the honoured professions such as the law so he was sent to the leyden academy but here again we have an artist who decided he knew enough of all else but art before he was twelve years old he found himself at that age in the studio of his first artmaster jacob van swanenburch a relative who had studied art in italy and was a good master for the lad but rembrandt became so brilliant a painter in three years time that he was sent to amsterdam to learn of abler men the lad could not in those days get far from his adored mother so he stayed only a little time before he went back to leyden where she was there was his heart and painting or no painting he must be near it until the past thirty years no one has seemed to know a great deal of rembrandts early history but much was written of him as a boorish gross vulgar fellow those stories were false he was a devoted son handsome studious in art and earnest in all that he did and after he had made his first notable painting he was compelled by the demands of his work to move to amsterdam for good he hired an apartment over a shop on the quay bloemgracht it is probable that his sister went with him to keep his house and that it is her face repeated so frequently in the many pictures which he painted at that time this does not suggest coarse doings or a careless life but permits us to imagine a quiet sober unselfish existence for the young bachelor at that time soon however he fell in love he saw one other woman to place in his heart and memory beside his mother his wife was saskia van ulenburg the daughter of an aristocrat refined and rich he met her through her cousin an art dealer who had ordered rembrandt to paint a portrait of his dainty cousin rembrandt could have been nothing but what was delightful and good since he was loved by so charming a girl as saskia he painted her sitting upon his knee and used her as model in many pictures first last and always he loved her tenderly in one portrait she is dressed in red and goldembroidered velvets the mantle she wore he had brought from leyden in another picture she is at her toilet having her hair arranged again she is painted in a great red velvet hat and then as a jewish bride wearing pearls and holding a shepherds staff in her hand again rembrandt painted himself as a giant at the feet of a dainty woman and in every way his work showed his love for her after he married her in june 1634 he painted the picture samsons wedding saskia dainty and serene sitting like a princess in a circle of her relatives he himself appearing as a crude plebeian whose strange jokes frighten more than they amuse the distinguished company the early years of his marriage were spent in joy and revelry surrounded by calculating business men who kept a tight grasp on their money bags he assumed the rle of an artist scattering money with a free hand surrounded by small townsmen most proper in demeanour he revealed himself as the bold lasquenet frightening them by his cavalier manners he brought together all manner of oriental arms ancient fabrics and gleaming jewellery and his house became one of the sights of amsterdam his existence reads like a fairy tale it is said that saskia strutted about decked in gold and diamonds till her relatives shook their heads in alarm and amazement at such wild goings on before he married saskia he had painted a remarkable picture named the school of anatomy it represents a great anatomist the friend of rembrandtnicholaus tulpand a group of physicians who were members of the guild of surgeons of amsterdam it is so wonderful a picture that even the dead man who is being used as a subject by the anatomist does not too greatly disturb us as we look upon him the thoughtful interested faces of the surgeons are so strong that we half lose ourselves in their feeling and forget to start in repulsion at sight of the dead body a fine description of this painting can be found in sarah k boltons book famous artists and it includes the description given by another excellent authority the artist was twentysix years old when he painted the school of anatomy this picture is now at the hague and two hundred years after it was painted the dutch government gave 30000 florins for it rembrandt painted a good many samsons first and lasthimself evidently being the strong man and the pictures beyond doubt express his own mood and his idea of his relation to things after a little son was born to the artist he painted still another samsonthis time menacing his fatherinlaw but as the artist had named his son after his fatherinlawrombertuswe cannot believe that there was any menace in the heart of rembrandtsamson soon his son died and rembrandt thought he should never again know happiness or that the world could hold a greater grief but one day he was to learn otherwise a little girl was born to the artist named cornelia after rembrandts mother and he was again very happy meantime his brothers and sisters had died and there came some trouble over rembrandts inheritance but what angered him most of all was that saskias relatives said she had squandered her heritage in ornaments and ostentation this made rembrandt wild with rage and he sued her slanderers for he himself had done the squandering buying every beautiful thing he could find or pay for to deck saskia in and he meant to go on doing so at this time he painted a picture of the feast of ahasuerus or the wedding of samson and he placed saskia in the middle of the table to represent esther or delilah as the case might be dressed in a way to horrify her critical relatives for she looked like a veritable princess laden with gorgeous jewels one of his pictures he wished to have hung in a strong light for he said pictures are not made to be smelt the odour of the colours is unhealthy the first baby girl died and on the birth of another daughter she too was named cornelia but that baby girl also died and next came a son titus named for saskias sister titia and then saskia died thus rembrandt knew the deepest sorrow of his life he painted her portrait once again from memory and that picture is quite unlike the others for it is no longer full of glowing life but daintier suggestive of a more spiritual life as if she were growing fragile it is written that from this time while he did much remarkable work he seemed like a man on a mountain top looking on one side to sweet meadows filled with flowers and sunlight and on the other to a desolate landscape over which a clouded sun is setting with saskia died the best of rembrandt he made only one more portrait of himselfbefore this he had made many and in it he makes himself appear a stern and fateful man it was after saskias death that he painted the night watch or more properly the sortie rembrandts home where he and saskia were so happy is still to be seen on a quay of the river amstel it is a house of brick and cut stone four stories high the vestibule used to have a flagstone pavement covered with firwood there were also blackcushioned spanish chairs for those who wait and all about were twentyfour busts and paintings there was an antechamber very large with seven spanish chairs covered with green velvet and a walnut table covered with a tournay cloth there was a mirror with an ebony frame and near by a marble winecooler upon the wall of this salon were thirtynine pictures and most of them had beautiful frames there were religious scenes landscapes architectural sketches works of pinas brouwer lucas van leyden and other dutch masters sixteen pictures by rembrandt and costly paintings by palma vecchio bassano and raphael in the next room was a real art museum containing splendid pictures an oaken press and other things which suggest that this was the workroom where rembrandts etchings were made and printed in the drawingroom was a huge mirror a great oaken table covered with a rich embroidered cloth six chairs with blue coverings a bed with blue hangings a cedar wardrobe and a chest of the same wood the walls were literally covered with pictures among which was a raphael above was a sort of museum and rembrandts studio there was rare glass from venice busts sketches paintings cloths weapons armour plants stuffed birds and shells fans and books and globes in short this was a most wonderful house and no other interior can we reconstruct as we can this because no other such detailed inventory can be found of a great mans effects as that from which these notes are taken a legal inventory made in 1656 long after saskia had died and possibly at a time when rembrandt wished to close his doors forever and forget the scenes in which he had been so happy holland being truly a protestant country its artists have given us no great madonna pictures although they painted loving happy dutch mothers and little babes but on the whole their subjects are quite different from those of the painters of italy france and spain rembrandts studio was different from any other when he first began to work independently and to have pupils he fitted it up with many little cells properly lighted so that each student might work alone as he knew far better work could be done in that way it is said that his pictures of beggars would by themselves fill a gallery he had a kindly sympathy for the poor and unfortunate and tramps knew this so that they swarmed about his studio doors trying to get sittings there is a story which doubtless had for its germ a joke regarding the slowness of an errand boy in a friends household but which at the same time shows us how rapidly rembrandt worked the artist had been carried off to the country to lunch with his friend jan six and as they sat down at the table six discovered there was no mustard he sent his boy hans for it and as the boy went out rembrandt wagered that he could make an etching before the boy got back six took the wager and the artist pulled a copper plate from his pockethe always carried oneand on its waxed surface began to etch the landscape before him just as hans returned rembrandt gleefully handed six the completed picture he was a great portrait painter but he loved certain effects of shadow so well that he often sacrificed his subjects good looks to his artistic purpose and very naturally his sitters became displeased so that in time he had fewer commissions than if he had been entirely accommodating his meals in working time were very simple often just bread and cheese eaten while sitting at his easel and after saskia died he became more and more careless of all domestic details rembrandt finally married again the second time choosing his housekeeper a good and helpful woman who was properly bringing up his little son and making life better ordered for the artist but he had grown poor by this time for he was never a very good business man his beautiful house was at last sold to a rich shoemaker every picture latterly reflected his condition and mood he chose subjects in which he imagined himself always to be the actor and when his second wife died he painted a picture of youth surprised by death he had not long to live he became more and more melancholy and sleeping by day would wander about the country at night disconsolate and sad finally when he died an inventory of his effects showed him to be possessed of only a few old woollen clothes and his brushes the miracle in rembrandts painting is the deep impenetrable shadow in which nevertheless one can see form and outline punctuated with wonderful explosions of light nothing like it has ever been seen it is the most dramatic work in the world and the most powerful in its effect other men have painted light and colour rembrandt makes gloom and shadow living things this miracleworkers funeral cost ten dollars he died in amsterdam and was buried in the wester kirk platethe sortie this picture is generally known as the night watch but it is really the sortie of a company of musketeers under the command of a standard bearer captain frans banningcock and all his company were to pay rembrandt for painting their portraits in a group and in action and they expected to see themselves in heroic and picturesque dress in the full blaze of day but rembrandt had found a magnificent subject for his wonderful shadows and the artist was not going to sacrifice it to the vanity of the archers this picture was called the patrouille de nuit by the french and the night watch by sir joshua reynolds because upon its discovery the picture was so dimmed and defaced by time that it was almost indistinguishable and it looked quite like a night scene after it was cleaned up it was discovered to represent broad daya party of archers stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight how this different light is painted which encircles the figures here sunny there gloomy rembrandt runs through the entire range of his colours from the lightest yellow through all shades of light and dark red to the gloomiest black one writer describes it thus it is more than a picture it is a spectacle and an amazing one a great crowd of human figures a great light a great darknessat the first glance this is what strikes you and for a moment you know not where to fix your eyes in order to comprehend that grand and splendid confusion there are officers halberdiers boys running arquebusiers loading and firing youths beating drums people bowing talking calling out gesticulatingall dressed in different costumes with round hats plumes casques morions iron corgets linen collars doublets embroidered with gold great boots stockings of all colours arms of every form and all this tumultuous and glittering throng start out from the dark background of the picture and advance toward the spectator the two first personages are frans banningcock lord of furmerland and ilpendam captain of the company and his lieutenant willem van ruijtenberg lord of vlaardingen the two marching side by side the only figures that are in full light are this lieutenant dressed in a doublet of buffalohide with gold ornaments scarf gorget and white plume with high boots and a girl who comes behind with blond hair ornamented with pearls and a yellow satin dress all the other figures are in deep shadow excepting the heads which are illuminated by what light here is the enigma is it the light of the sun or of the moon or of the torches there are gleams of gold and silver moonlight coloured reflections fiery lights personages which like the girl with blond tresses seem to shine by a light of their own the more you look at it the more it is alive and glowing and even seen only at a glance it remains forever in the memory with all its mystery and splendour like a stupendous vision charles blanc has said to tell the truth this is only a dream of night and no one can decide what the light is that falls on the groups of figures it is neither the light of the sun or of the moon nor does it come from the torches it is rather the light from the genius of rembrandt this wonderful picture was painted in 1642 and many of the archers guild who gave rembrandt the commission would not pay their share because their faces were not plainly seen this picture which alone was enough to make him immortal was the very last commission that any of the guilds were willing to give the artist because he would not make their portraits beautiful or fine looking to the disadvantage of the whole picture this work hangs in the rijks museum in amsterdam he painted more than six hundred and twentyfive pictures and some of them are the anatomy lesson the syndics of the cloth hall the descent from the cross samson threatening his step father the money changer holy family the presentation of christ in the temple the marriage of samson the rape of ganymede susanna and the elders manoahs sacrifice the storm the good samaritan pilate washing his hands ecce home and pictures of his wife saskia xxxiv sir joshua reynolds english school 17231792 pupil of thomas hudson when reynolds was little josh instead of sir joshua he grew tired in church one day and sketched upon the nail of his thumb the portrait of the rev mr smart who was preaching after service he ran to a boathouse near and with ships paint upon an old piece of sail he painted in full and flowing colours that reverend gentlemans portrait after that there was not the least possible excuse for his father to deny him the right to become an artist the father himself was a clergyman with a good education and he had meant that his son should also be well educated and become a physician but a lad who at eight years of age can draw the plympton school househe was born at plympton earl in devonshirehas a right to choose his own profession at twentythree years of age sir joshua was painting the portraits of great folk and being well paid for it as well as lavishly praised his first real sorrow came at a christmas time when he was summoned home from london where he was working to his fathers deathbed after that the artist turned his thoughts toward italy but where was the money to come from earning a living did not include travelling expenses but a good friend captain keppel was going out to treat with the dey of algiers about his piracies and learning that the artist wished to go to italy he invited him to go with him on his own ship the centurion so while the captain was discussing pirates with the dey sir joshua stopped with the governor of minorca and painted many of the people of that locality thence on to rome strange to say raphaels pictures disappointed the english artist and he said so but michael angelo was to reynolds the most wonderful of painters and he said that his pictures influenced him all the rest of his life he wished his name to be the last upon his lips and while that was not so yet it was the last he pronounced to his fellow academicians in his final address it was in italy that a distressing misfortune came upon sir joshua he meant to learn all that a man could learn in a given time of the art treasures there and while he was working in a draughty corridor of the vatican he caught a severe cold which rendered him deaf he continued deaf till the end of his life and had to use an eartrumpet when people talked with him when he got back to england hudson his old master said discouragingly reynolds you dont paint as well as when you left england on the whole his reception at home after his long absence was not all that he could have wished but he took a place in leicester square settled down to live there for the rest of his life and went at painting in earnest although artists criticised him more or less after his return the public appreciated him and very soon orders for portraits began to pour in upon him and the flow of wealth never ceased so long as he lived it was said that all the fashionables came to him that did not go to gainsborough but those who were partial to sir joshua declared that all who could not go to him went to gainsborough the two great artists controlled the art world in their time dividing honours about equally it was said that all those women and men sat to sir joshua for portraits who wished to be transmitted as angels and who wished to appear as heroes or philosophers sir joshua was a charming man generous in feelingas gainsborough was notand his closest friend was dr johnson the most different man from the artist imaginable but reynoldss art and johnsons philosophy made a fine combination each giving the other great pleasure besides johnson his friends were goldsmith garrick bishop percy and other famous men of the time these and others formed the literary club at sir joshuas suggestion about that time there was the first public exhibition of the work of english artists and sir benjamin west and sir joshua reynolds built the royal academy for that first exhibition with the help of king georges patronage joshua reynolds was knighted when he was made the first president of that great body soon after the academy was established reynolds began a series of discourses which in time became famous for their splendid literary quality and some people knowing his close friendship with burke and dr johnson declared that the artist got one of them to write his discourses for him this threw johnson and burke into a fury of resentment for their friend and the doctor declared indignantly that sir joshua would as soon get me to paint for him as to write for him burke denied the story no less emphatically besides these speeches which were a great advantage to the members of the academy sir joshua instituted the annual banquet to the members and king georgewho just before had given the commission of court painter to one less talented than sir joshuabade him paint his portrait and the queens to hang in the academy this was a great thing for the new society and advanced its fortunes very much barry and gainsborough were both churlish enough to envy sir joshua and to quarrel with his good feeling for them but both men had the grace to be sorry for behaviour that had no excuse and both made friends with him before they diedgainsborough on his deathbed toward his last days the artist was attacked with paralysis but grew better and was able to paint again then he began to go blindhe was already deafand this affliction made painting impossible shortly before his death he undertook to raise funds for a monument to his dead friend dr johnson but he grew more and more ill and on the 23d february 1792 this great artist and blameless gentleman passed peacefully away that he was very painstaking in his work is shown by an anecdote about his infant hercules how did you paint that part of the picture some one asked him how can i tell there are ten pictures below this some better some worseshowing that in his desire for perfection he painted and repainted so untiring was he in seeking out the secrets of the old masters that he bought works of titian and rubens and scraped them to learn their methods insisting that they had some secret underlying their work so anxious was he to get the most brilliant effects of colours that he mixed his paints with asphaltum egg varnish wax and the like till one artist said the wonder is that the picture did not crack beneath the brush many of these great pictures did go to pieces because of the chances sir joshua took in mixing things that did not belong together in order to make wonderful results sir george beaumont recommended a friend to go to reynolds for his portrait and the friend demurred because his colours fade and his pictures die before the man never mind that sir george declared a faded portrait by reynolds is better than a fresh one by anybody else the same tender sensitive and devoted nature which caused sir joshuas mother to weep herself blind upon her husbands death belonged to the artist all of his life he was surrounded by loving friends and his devotion to them was conspicuous he like drer and several other painters was a seventh son and his fathers disappointment was keen when he took to art instead of to medicine so little did his father realise what his future might be that he wrote under the sketch of a wall with a window in it drawn upon a latin exercise book this is drawn by joshua in school out of pure idleness but by the time joshua was eight years old and had drawn a fine sketch of the grammarschool with its cloister the astonished father said now this exemplifies what the author of perspective says in his preface that by observing the rules laid down in this book a man may do wondersfor this is wonderful sir joshua laid downeven wrote outa great many rules of conduct for himself some of these were the great principle of being happy in this world is not to mind or be affected with small things also if you take too much care of yourself nature will cease to take care of you when samuel reynolds joshuas father consulted with his friend mr craunch as to whether a boy who made wonderful paintings at twelve years of age would be likely to be a successful apothecary he told craunch that joshua himself had declared that he would rather be a good apothecary than a poor artist but if he could be bound to a good master of painting he would prefer that above everything in the world this was how he came to be apprenticed to hudson the painter young reynoldss sister paid for his instruction at firstor for half of it with the understanding that reynolds was to pay her back when he was earning at that time reynolds wrote to his father while i am doing this i am the happiest creature alive one day while in an art store buying something for hudson reynolds saw alexander pope the poet come in and every one bowed to him and made way for him as if for a prince pope shook hands with young reynolds and in writing home describing the poet the artist said that he was about four feet six inches high very humpbacked and deformed he wore a black coat and according to the fashion of that time had on a little sword he had a large and very fine eye and a long handsome nose his mouth had those peculiar marks which are always found in the mouths of crooked persons and the muscles which run across the cheeks were so strongly marked that they seemed like small cords this is a masterly description of one famous man by another he finally was dismissed from his masters studio on the ground that he had neglected to carry a picture to its owner at the time set by hudson but the fact was the older artist had become jealous of the work of his pupil and would no longer have him in his studio afterwards while he was painting down in devonshirethirty portraits of country squires for fifteen dollars apiecehe said those who are determined to excel must go to their work whether willing or unwilling morning noon and night and they will find it to be no play but on the contrary very hard labour this shows that reynoldss idea of genius was an infinite capacity for hard work while reynolds was on his memorable journey to rome he made several volumes of notes about the pictures of great italian artistsraphael titian etc and one of those volumes is in the lenox library new york city he made a most characteristic and delightful remark in regard to his disappointment in raphaels pictures i did not for a moment conceive or suppose that the name of raphael and those admirable paintings in particular owed their reputation to the ignorance of mankind on the contrary my not relishing them as i was conscious i ought to have done was one of the most humiliating things that ever happened to me he loved home and country so much that while in venice he heard a familiar ballad sung in an opera and it brought the tears to his eyes because of its association with home his young sister was so undecided in her ways and opinions as to make it impossible for reynolds long to live with her but she undertook to be his housekeeper when he returned to london and she also tried to copy his pictures reynolds said the results made other people laugh but they made me cry reynolds painted the portraits of two irish sistersthe countess of coventry and the duchess of hamiltontwo of the most beautiful women in all the british empire seven hundred people sat up all night in and about a yorkshire inn to see the duchess of hamilton get into her postchaise in the morning while a worcester shoemaker made money by showing the shoe he was making for the countess of coventry sir joshua declared that whenever a new sitter came to him even till the last years of his life he always began his portrait with the determination that that one should be the best he had ever painted success was bound to attend that sort of man he painted every picture almost as an experiment meaning to learn something new with every work and he spent more than he made in perfecting his art as he said he would be content to ruin himself in order to own one of the best works of titian his deeds of kindness are beyond counting he rescued his friend dr johnson from debtthereby saving him from prison and when a young lad a son of dr mudge who was very anxious to visit his father on the occasion of his sixteenth birthday grew too ill to make the journey reynolds said gaily no matter my boy i will send you to your father he painted a splendid portrait of the boy and sent it to dr mudge this gift of a picture however was very unusual with reynolds who unlike gainsborough who gave his by the bushel to everyone declared that his pictures were not valued unless paid for when sir william lowther a gay and rich young man of london died he left twentyfive thousand dollars to each of thirteen friends and each of the thirteen commissioned the painter to make a portrait of lowther their benefactor his work room was of interest the chair for his sitters was raised eighteen inches from the floor and turned on casters his palettes were those which are held by a handle not those held on the thumb the stocks of his pencils were long measuring about nineteen inches he painted in that part of the room nearest to the window and never sat down when he painted the chariot in which he drove about had the four seasons allegorically painted upon its panels and his liveries were laced with silver while the wheels of his coach were carved with foliage and gilded sir joshua knew that it paid to advertise and as he had no time to go about in that gorgeous chariot he made his sister go for he declared that people seeing that magnificent coach would ask whose chariot is that and upon being told could not fail to be impressed with his prestige the comical inconsequence of this anecdote concerning a man so important robs it of vulgarity the graceful anecdotes told of reynolds are without number but one and all are to his advantage and show him to have been good and gentle a devoted and highbred man platethe duchess of devonshire and her daughter this is generally considered one of the finest of sir joshuas pictures if not the most beautiful of all he was such a welcome guest at the houses of grandees that perchance he had noticed the lovely duchess playing with her still more lovely baby and thought what a charming picture the two would make as a representation of the artists ability to portray grace and sweetness it can hardly be surpassed he painted it in 1786 half a dozen years before his death and it now hangs in chatsworth the home of the present duke of devonshire other well known reynolds paintings are the hon ann bingham the countess of spencer the nieces of sir horace walpole and the angels heads in the national gallery xxxv peter paul rubens flemish school 15771640 pupil of tobias verhaecht the story of peter paul rubens whose birthday falling upon the saint days of peter and paul gave to him his name is hardly more interesting than that of his parents although it is quite different the story of rubenss parents seems a part of the artists story because it must have had something to do with influencing his life so let us begin with that john rubens was peter pauls father and he was a learned man a druggist but he had also studied law and had been town councillor and alderman in the town where he was born life went easily enough with him till the reformation wrought by martin luther began to change john rubenss way of thinking and he turned from catholic to lutheran from being a good catholic john rubens became a rabid reformer and when under the new faith the antwerp churches were stripped of their treasures the magistrates were called to account for it john rubens as councillor was among those summoned the magistrates declared that they were all good catholics but a list of the reformers fell into the duke of alvas hands and rubenss name was there this meant death unless he should succeed in flying from the country which he instantly did that was in 1568 when he had four children but peter paul was not one of themsince he was a seventh son the rubens family went to live in cologne where the father found his learning of great use to him and he was honoured by being made legal adviser to anne of saxony who was william the silents second queen john rubenss behaviour was not entirely honourable and before long he was thrown into prison but his good wife maria pypelincx undertook to free him he had treated her very badly but her devotion to his cause was as great as if he had treated her well despite his wifes efforts he was kept a prisoner in the dungeon at dillenburg for two years and afterward he was removed to siegen the place where peter paul was born in the sixteenth century there were no records of any sort kept in the town of siegen and so we cannot be absolutely sure that peter paul was born there but his mother was certainly there just before and after the date of his birth which was the 29th of june 1577 after his birth his father was set free in siegen and allowed to go back to the city in which he had misbehaved himself in cologne he became once more a catholic and he died in that faith meantime ten years had passed since peter pauls birth and both his father and mother were determined above all things their son should have a fine education quite unlike other artists for the boy seemed capable of learning while he was still very small he could speak to his tutor in french to his mother in flemish and to his father in latin besides these languages he spoke also italian and english before he was an artist rubens like drer and leonardo da vinci was a child of rare intelligence as a little chap he went to antwerp with his motherthis was after his fathers deathand in belgium he took for the first time the rle of courtier in which he was to become so successful later in life the charming little fellow dressed in velvet and lace took his place in the household of the countess of lalaing in brussels very soon after entering that household rubens was permitted by his mother to leave it for the studio of the painter who was his first master though not the one who really taught him much rubens did not stay there long but went instead to the studio of adam van noort an excellent painter of the time after that he studied under another artist who was both a scholar and a gentleman van veen and with him peter paul was able to speak in latin and in his many other languages while learning to paint at the same time thus we find rubenss lot was always cast not among the rich but among the intelligent the well bred and the cultivated this fact alone would prepare us to anticipate pleasant things for him and from him in those days of guilds there were many rules and regulations van noort rubenss teacher was dean of the painters guild and through his influence the guild recognised rubens as master which meant that he was qualified to take pupils thus he was pupil and teacher at the same time one is unable to think of rubens as having low tastes as being morose erratic or anything but a refined gracious and brilliant gentleman he began well lived well and ended well none of his teachers really impressed their style of art upon him he was the model for others rubens became nothing but rubens but all the art world wished to become rubenesque rubens went to mantua to see the art of italy and while there he met the duke of mantua who was vincenzo gonzaga the richest most powerful personage of that region and time the duke engaged rubens to paint the portraits of many beautiful womenjust the sort of commission that rubenss pupil van dyck would have loved but rubenss art was of sterner stuff and the work by no means delighted him he had great ideas profound purposes and wished to undertake them but just then it seemed best that he perform that which the duke of mantua wanted him to do hence he set about it later rubens went to the spanish court not as a painter but as a cavalier upon a diplomatic mission bearing many beautiful presents to king philip iii he went to madrid where his elegance manly beauty dashing manner and ability to speak several languages made him a wonderful success he remained for three years at the court and studied the methods of spanish painters he also painted the members of the spanish court as velasquez had done but they looked like people of another world the spanish aristocracy had always been painted with pallid faces languid and elegant poses but rubens gave them a touch of the life he lovedmade them robust and apparently healthyminded of all great colourists rubens took the lead titian with his golden hues and warm haired women was very great but rubens the fleming as he was called revelled in richness of colouring and flamed through art like a glorious comet rubens had long been wanted in his own country his sovereigns albert and isabella wished him to return and become their painter but they were unable to free him from his engagements in italy and spain at last rubens received word that his mother whom he loved devotedly was likely to die and what kings could not do his love for her accomplished although his patron the duke of mantua was absent and his consent could not be secured rubens set off posthaste to his mothers home he arrived in antwerp too late to see maria pypelincx who had died before he reached her once more on his native soil albert and isabella determined to induce him to remain he had intended to go back to mantua and continue his work under the duke but since he was now in belgium he decided to stay there and thus he became the court painter in his own country which after all he greatly preferred to any other he was to have a salary of five hundred livres 96 a year also the rights honours privileges exemptions etc that belonged to those of the royal household and he was given a gold chain in this day of large doings there is something about such details that seems childish but a gold chain was by no means a small affair at a time when 96 was considered an ample moneyprovision for an artist that gorgeous gold chain a mark of distinction rather than a reward is to be seen in all its glory in one of rubenss great paintings the artist himself is mounted upon a horse the chain about his neck while he is surrounded by no fewer than eightandtwenty lifesize figures many in gorgeous attire warriors in steel armour horsemen slaves camels etc this picture the adoration of the magi was twelve feet by seventeen and was painted at the towns expense it was later sent to spain and placed in the madrid gallery one of the greatest honours that could come to students of that day was to be admitted to rubenss studio to paint under his direction and it is said that hundreds of young men waited their turn painting meanwhile in the studios of inferior artists till they should be admitted to the studio of the great master rubens was a king among painters as well as a painter patronised by kings he had two wives and he married the first one in 1609 her name was isabella brant sir joshua reynolds said of her his wife is very handsome and has an agreeable countenance but the picture is rather hard in mannerby which he meant a picture which rubens had painted of her one of his greatest privileges when he was engaged at the court of albert and isabella had been that he need obey none of the exactions of the guild of st luke none of their rigid rules concerning the employment of art students rubens could take into his service whom he pleased whether they had been admitted as members of the guild or not though to be a member of the guild was a testimony to their qualifications in the end this did a good deal of harm for rubens employed students to do the preliminary work of his pictures who had not been his pupils and who were not otherwise qualified thus we read criticisms like that of sir joshuas and many of rubenss pictures are marred in this manner a story is told of van dyck and other pupils of rubens breaking into the masters studio and smudging a picture which van dyck afterward repaired by painting in the damaged portion most successfully we are also told in connection with rubenss picture the descent from the cross that van dyck restored an arm and shoulder of mary of magdala but certainly van dyck did not become a pupil of rubens till some time after that picture was painted the work of a wonderful period in rubenss art was completely destroyed in two years time he painted forty ceilings of churches in antwerp all of which were burned but there is a record of them in the copies made by de witt in water colours from which etchings were afterward made this work of rubens was the first example of foreshortening done by a flemish painter above all things rubens liked to paint big pictures on very large surfaces as did michael angelo the large size of picture gives us painters more courage to present our ideas with the utmost freedom and semblance of reality i confess myself to be by a natural instinct better fitted to execute works of the largest size he wrote this to the english diplomat trumbull in 1621 in the midst of rubenss greatest success as a painter came his diplomatic services it was desirable that spain and england should be friends and rubens always moving about because of his work and being so very clever the spanish powers thought him a good one to negotiate with england while on a professional visit to paris the english duke of buckingham and the artist met and this seemed to open a way for business the infanta consented to have rubens undertake this delicate piece of statesmanship but philip of spain did not like the idea of an artista wandering fellow as an artist was then thought to beentering into such a dignified affair the real negotiator on the english side was gerbier by birth also a fleming and strange to tell he too had been an artist the english engaged him to look after their interests in the affair and as soon as philip learned that their diplomat was also an artist his prejudices against rubens as a statesman disappeared so it was decided that the two flemings artists and diplomats should meet in holland to discuss matters about that time sir dudley carleton wrote to lord conway rubens is come hither to holland where he now is and gerbier in his company walking from town to town upon their pretence of taking pictures which may serve him for a few days if he dispatch and be gone but yf he entertayne tyme here long he will infallibly be layd hold of or sent with disgrace out of the country this i have made known to rubens lest he should meet with a skorne what may in some sort reflect upon others the two clever men got through with their talk nothing unfortunate happened and rubens got off to spain where he laid the result of his talk with gerbier before the spanish powers he was given a studio in philips palace where he carried on his art and his diplomacy the king became delighted with him as a man and an artist and as well as attending to state business he did some wonderful painting while in madrid he was there nine months or more and then started off for england to tell charles i of philip iiis wishes but upon his arrival he learned that a peace had just been concluded between france and england and all was excitement he was received in england as a great artist every honour was showered upon him and when he made philips request to charles that he should not act in a manner hostile to spain charles agreed and kept that agreement though france and venice urged him to break it charles knighted rubens while he was in england and the university of cambridge made him master of arts the sword used by the king at the time he gave the accolade is still kept by rubenss descendants while he was in london rubens was very nearly drowned in the thames going down to greenwich in a boat when he first went from italy to spain on a mission of state he carried a note or passport bearing the following lines with these presents he took magnificent gifts to philip among them a carriage and six neapolitan horses comes peter paul a fleming peter paul will say all that is proper like the well informed man that he is peter paul is very successful in painting portraits if any ladies of quality wish their pictures let them take advantage of his presence when he visited england there was no longer need of such introduction he went in all the magnificence that his genius had earned for him rubens was always a happy man so far as history shows he married the first time a woman who was beautiful and who loved him as he loved her he was able to build for himself a beautiful house in antwerp in the middle of it was a great salon big enough to hold all his collection of pictures vases bronzes and beautiful jewels there was also a magnificent staircase up which his largest pictures could be easily carried for it was built especially to accommodate the requirements of his work rubenss greatest picture was painted through a strange happening when this beautiful house was being built the land next to his belonged to the archers guild and when the workmen came to dig rubenss cellar they went too far and invaded the adjoining property the archers made complaint and there seemed no way to adjust the matter till some one suggested that rubens make them a picture which should be accepted as compensation for the harm done this rubens did and the picture was to be st christopherthe archers patron saint but when the work was done rubens surprised them by exhibiting a picture of all who could ever have been called christbearers this was the descent from the crossnot a single picture but a picture within a picture for there were shutters folding in front of it and on these was painted the archers patron st christopher rubenss daily life is described thus his life was very methodical he rose at four attended mass breakfasted and painted for hours then he rested dined worked until late afternoon then after riding for an hour or two one of his spirited horses and later supping he would spend the evening with his friends he was fond of books and often a friend would read aloud to him while he worked this is a pleasant picture of a reasonable and worthy life it is said that once he painted eighteen pictures in eighteen days and it is known that he valued his time at fifty dollars a day his pupil van dyck being pushed for money turned alchemist and tried to manufacture gold but when rubens was approached by a visionary who wanted him to lend him money by which he might pursue such a work promising rubens a fortune when he should have discovered how to make his gold the artist laughed and said you are twenty years too late friend when i wield these indicating his palette and brush i turn all to gold many are the delightful anecdotes told of rubens it is said that while he was at the english court he was painting the ceiling of the kings banqueting hall and a courtier who stood watching wished to say something pour passer le temps so he asked does the ambassador of his catholic majesty sometimes amuse himself with painting nobut he sometimes amuses himself with being an ambassador was the witty retort which showed how he valued his two commissions when king charles i knighted rubens he gave him beside the jewelled sword a golden chain to which his miniature was attached if rubens had gone about with all the chains and decorations given him by kings and other great ones of the earth he would have been weighted down and would have needed two pairs of shoulders on which to display them rubenss first wife died and when he married again he was as fond of painting pictures of the second wife as he had been of the first the name of the second was helena fourment and she is called by one author a spicy blonde certainly she was very gay big and robust and only sixteen years old when she married rubens who was then a man of fiftythree of one picture the straw hat for which he is supposed to have used his wifes sister as model he was so fond that he would not sell it at any price rubens had a rare mother as shown in her letters to her husband john when he was in prison for his wrongdoing it would seem that such a mother must have a strong forceful son and rubens is less of a surprise than many artists who had no such influence in their childhood the history of rubenss mother is worthy of being told even had she not had a famous son who painted a beautiful picture of her rubenss holy families are like those of no other painter the virgin the child all the others in the picture are quite different from the italian figures these are human beings good to look upon full of love and joy softness and beauty it was his learning that first won favour for him in italy the duke of mantua hearing him read from virgil spoke to him in latin and being answered in that tongue was so charmed that the foundation of their friendship and the dukes patronage was laid in italy he was called the antiquary and apelles of our time his nephewbiographer writes of him he never gave himself the pastime of going to parties where there was drinking and cardplaying having always had a dislike for such as rubens grew in fame he found that many were jealous of him and on one occasion a rival proposed that he and rubens each paint a picture upon a certain subject and leave it to judges to decide which work was the bestrubenss or his own no said rubens my attempts have been subjected to the scrutiny of connoisseurs in italy and spain they are to be found in public collections and private galleries in those countries gentlemen are at liberty to place their works beside them in order that comparison may be made this was a dignified way of disposing of the case rubens loved to paint animals and he had a great lion brought to his home that he might study its poses and movements the flesh of his figures was so lifelike that guido declared he must mix blood with his paints he was called the painter of life rubens a seventh child had also seven children two belonging to his first wife five to the second many stories are told of his patience and his kindness it is said that at one time his old pupil van dyck returned to antwerp after an absence greatly depressed and in need of money rubens bought all his unsold pictures and he did this charitable act more than once and is known to have done the same thing for a rival and enemy out of sheer goodness of heart kings and queens came to the rubens house people of many nations did him honour and toward his closing days when gout had disabled him ambassadors visited him since he could not go to them in a description of his death and burial which took place at antwerp we read he was buried at night as was the custom a great concourse of citizens and sixty orphan children with torches followed the body he was placed in the vault of the fourment family and as he had requested the holy family was hung above him in that picture we find the st george to be rubens himself st jerome his father an angel his youngest son while martha and mary are isabella and helena his two wives he left many sketches to whichever of his sons became an artist or to the husband of his daughter who should marry an artist but there were none such to claim the bequest platethe infant jesus and st john the little girl behind jesus is supposed to represent his future bride the christian church the thoughtful farseeing look upon the face of the christchild though it does not clash with his youthful charm is meant to suggest that he has a premonition of his work in the world the other joyous little figures also demonstrate the artists love for children he brings them into his pictures as cherubs wherever he can and they are frequently just as well painted and more universally appreciated than his stout women in this picture he has a good opportunity to show his adorable flesh tints combined with the movement and freedom naturally associated with child life the original painting is in the court museum at vienna but it has always been so popular that many copies of it have been made and one of these is in the berlin gallery platethe artists two sons see frontispiece this picture hangs in the lichtenstein gallery at vienna the two boys eleven and seven years of age are the sons of rubens by his first wife isabella brant and albert the elder of the two greatly resembles his mother he is evidently a student for he wears the dress of one and carries a book in one hand the other is placed affectionately upon the shoulder of his little brother nicolas whose face figure and attire are all much the more childish of the two critics consider this painting to mark the highest point which rubens reached in portraiture it has all the colour character and vitality of his best work some of his other pictures are coronation of marie de medicis the kirmesse slaughter of the innocents susannas bath capture of samson a lion hunt and the rape of the daughters of leucippus xxxvi john singer sargent american and foreign schools 18561926 pupil of carolus durand this artist was born in europe of american parents thus we may say that he was american though he owed nothing but dollars to the united states since his instruction was obtained in italy and france and all his associations in art and friendship were there he was probably the most brilliant of the artists termed american his great mural work in the boston public library is hardly to be surpassed above all sargents portraits are masterly he was famous in that branch of art before he was twentyeight years old among his finest portraits is that of carmencita a spanish dancer who for a time set the world wild with pleasure the list of his famous portraits is very long sargents father was a philadelphia physician who originally came from new england but the artist himself was born in florence he was given a good education and grew up with the beauties of florence all about him in a refined and charming home he was the delight of his master carolus durand for he was modest and refined yet full of enthusiasm and energy in his twentythird year he painted a fine picture of his master sargent was a musician as well as a painter a man of great versatility as if the gods and all the muses had presided at his birth platecarmencita in this picture of the famous spanish dancer sargent shows all the life and character he can put into a portrait the girl seems on the point of springing into motion she is poised ready for flight and the proud lift of her head makes one believe that she will accomplish the most difficult steps she attempts the painting is in the luxembourg paris other noted sargent portraits are mr marquand in the metropolitan museum of art lady elcho mrs arden mrs tennant mrs meyer and children homer st gaudens henschel and mr penrose xxxvii tintoretto jacopo robusti venetian school 15181594 pupil of titian tintoretto was born with an ideal as a young boy he wrote upon his studio wall the drawing of michael angelo the colouring of titian and that was the end he tried to reach his father was a tintorea dyer of silk a tinterand it was from the character of that work the artist took his name he helped his father with the dyeing of silks while he was still a child and was called ii tintoretto little dyer as the little tinter showed great genius for painting his father placed him in titians studio but for some reason he only stayed there a few days long enough however to permit us to call him a pupil of titian especially as he wrote that masters name upon his wall and determined to imitate him after his few days with titian tintoretto studied with schiavone and afterward set up a studio for himself as a determined lad in this studio of his tintoretto tried every means of developing his art he studied the figures upon medicean tombs made by michael angelo taking plaster casts of them and copying them in his studio he used to hang little clay figures up by strings attached to his ceiling that he might get the effect of them high in air by looking at them thus from below he gained an idea of foreshortening although this artist nearly succeeded in getting into line with michael angelo he did not colour after the fashion of his master titian tintoretto was about twentyeight years old before he got any very big commission but at that age a chance came to him in the church of santa maria del orto were two great bare spaces unsightly and vast about fifty feet high and twenty broad in that day anything and everything was decorated with masterpieces and it was almost disgraceful for a church to let such a space as that go unfrescoed tintoretto saw an opportunity and finally offered to paint pictures there for nothing if the church would agree to pay for the materials he needed the church certainly was not going to refuse such an offer even if tintoretto was not thought to be much of an artist at the time if the work was poor one day they could choose to have it repainted thus tintoretto got his first great opportunity he painted on those walls the last judgment and the golden calf they made him famous and gained him the commission to paint the picture which is used as an illustration here the brothers of the scuola di san rocco asked him to compete with veronese in painting the ceilings after he had done four pictures for their walls tintoretto consented and veronese and two others who were in the competition set about making their sketches which they were to present for the brothers consideration finaly the day of decision came all were assembled the artists armed with sketches of their plans where are yours tintoretto the others asked we expect a drawing of your idea well there it is the artist answered drawing a screen from the ceiling behold he had already painted it to suit himself the work was complete that is the way i make my sketches he said though the work was magnificent it had not been done according to the monks ideas of business and order they objected and objected very well the artist cried i will make the ceiling a present to you as there was a rule of their order forbidding them to refuse a present they had to accept tintorettos this did not promise very good business at the time but the work was so splendid and tintoretto so reasonable that they finally agreed to give him all the work of their ordernearly enough to keep him employed during a lifetime after that he painted sixty great pictures upon their walls he painted so much and so fast that he did not always do good work and one critic declares that while tintoretto was the equal of titian he was often inferior to tintorettowhich after all is a very fine compliment his life was so tranquil and uneventful that there is little to say of it but there is much to say of his art he lived mostly in his studio and when he died he was buried in the santa maria del ortothe church in which he had done his first work veronese had given to venice a brilliant glowing rich ravishing riot of colour and figures but tintoretto was said to rise up against the joyful veronese as the black knight of the middle ages the sombre priest of a gloomy art tintoretto was of stormy temperament and upon one occasion he proved it by thrusting a pistol under a critics nose after he had invited him to his studio it is this half savage spirit that may be seen in his paintings he had deepset staring eyes it is said a furrowed brow and hollow cheeks indicative of his passionate spirit he painted very few female figures but mostly men when he did paint a woman she looked mannish and not beautiful when he painted gorgeous subjects like doges and senators he gave to them gloomy backgrounds aweinspiring poses and he seldom painted a figure fullface but threequarter or half so that he did not give himself a chance to present human figures in beautiful postures he is said to have been the first who painted groups of wellknown men in pictures intended for the decoration of public buildings one great critic has written that while the dutch in order to unite figures represented them at a banquet tintorettos nobili aristocrats were far too proud to show themselves to the people in so gay and informal a situation with the coming of tintoretto it was said a dark cloud had overcast the bright heaven of venetian art instead of smiling women bloody martyrs and pale ascetics were painted by him he dissected the dead in order to learn the structure of the human body in his paintings his women especially with their pale livid features and encircled eyes strangely sparkling as if from black depths have nothing in common with the soft painted flesh which he pictured in his youth while he was following titian as closely as he could as he grew older and his art more fixed he followed michael angelo more and more titians colouring was that of an autumn day but tintorettos that of a dismal night yet these very qualities in tintorettos work made him great platethe miracle of st mark this painting in the academy at venice tells the story of how a christian slave who belonged to a pagan nobleman went to worship at the shrine of st mark that was unlawful the nobleman had his slave taken before the judge who ordered him to be tortured just as the executioner raised the hammer with which he was finally to kill the slave st mark himself came down from heaven broke the weapon and rescued the slave the figure of the patron saint of venice is swooping down head first above the group his garments flying in the air a bright light touches the slaves naked body as he lies upon his back the executioner having turned away and raised his hammer aloft while others have drawn back in fright at the appearance of the patron saint we may imagine that tintoretto was trying to acquire this power of painting wonderful figures hovering in the air when he hung his little clay images from the ceiling of his studio years before other pictures of his are the marriage of bacchus and ariadne martyrdom of st agnes st rocco healing the sick the annunciation the crucifixion and many others xxxviii titian tiziano vecelli pronounced titzeeahno vaychellee venetian school 14771576 pupil of giovanni and gentile bellini titian was a child of the tirol mountains handsome strong full of health and fine purposes even as a boy he was born in a little cottage at pieve in the valley of cadore through which flows the river piave and he wandered daily beside its banks gathering flowers from which he squeezed the juices to paint with when he grew up he became a wonderful colourist and from his boyhood nothing so much delighted him as the brilliant colours flaunted by the flowers of wood and field gathered about his good fathers hearth were many children caterina francesco orsa and the rest living in peace and happiness closely bound together by love titian had a gentle loving mother named lucia while his father was a soldier and an honoured man in the little town where they lived he was councillor and also superintendent of the castle and inspector of mines no light honours among those simple country people doubtless titian inherited his splendid bearing and his determined character from his soldier father even while a little child the man who was destined to become a great artist began his work with the juices of the wildflowers which he daubed upon the wall of the humble home in the tirol valley making a madonna with angels at her feet and a little jesus upon her knee but if titian was a great painter he was never even a fair scholar he went to school but would not or could not study his father soon saw that he was wasting his time and being made very unhappy through being forced to do that for which he had no ability so he was soon released from booklearning and sent to venice seventyfive miles from home to learn art in venice the vecelli family had an uncle and it was with him that titian lived though he studied first with sebastian zuccato the head of the venetian guild of mosaic workers and a pretty good teacher in his way he was not able to teach titian very much for the boy was an inspired artist and needed a good master so after a little the family held a consultation and it was decided that titian should become the pupil of gentile bellini a very clever artist indeed there was an interesting story told about this master which made the vecellis feel that their boy would do well to be under the influence of a kindhearted man as well as a genius it seems that bellinis fame had become so great that the sultan had sent for him to paint the portraits of himself and the sultana bellini went gladly to turkey to do this but he took with him certain pictures to show his patron among them was one of st john the baptist having his head cut off the sultan looked at it and cutting heads off being a large part of his business he saw that bellini had not scientifically painted it and in order to show him the true way to conduct such matters he sent for a slave and ordered his head chopped off in bellinis presence bellini was so terrified and sickened by the dreadful sight that he fled from turkey and would not paint its ruler the sultana nor anyone else who had to do with such cruel things as he had witnessed it was into this mans studio that titian went as a young boy but after a little he displeased gentile bellini who complained that his pupil worked too fast and therefore could not expect to do great work he declared that picture painting was serious and careful work and that titian was too careless and quick as a matter of fact titian was too wonderful for bellini ever to do much for and since he could not get on with him he went to another mastergentile bellinis brother giovanni one of titians chief troubles in the studio of gentile had been that he was not allowed to use the gorgeous colouring he loved but in the brothers studio he found to his joy that colour was more valued and he was given more freedom to use it also there was a young peasant pupil with giovanni who like titian loved to use beautiful colours and he and the newcomer became fast friends the other artists name was giorgione and he had the most delightful ways about him winning friends wherever he went so it was no wonder that the warmhearted titian sought his companionship one day those two young comrades left their masters studio to have a good time off by themselves there was a stated hour for their return but they had spent all their money and forgot that giovanni bellini was expecting them home when they did return the door was closed and locked what were they to do they did the only thing they could as comrades in misfortune they joined forces set up a studio of their own and went to work to earn their living as best they might at first it was hard sledding but in time they got a good job namely to decorate the walls of a public building in venice which was used by foreign merchants for the transaction of their business a sort of exchange as we understand it this was the fondaco de tedeschi and it had two great halls eighty rooms and twentysix warehouses it was indeed a big undertaking for the two young men and they divided the business between them their joy was great their cartoons successfully made and the work well begun when alas they fell to quarreling simply because someone had declared that titians work upon the building was a little better than giorgiones this dispute parted the two friends who had had good times together and it must have been giorgiones fault because ludovico dolce one who knew titian well said that he was most modest he never spoke reproachfully of other painters in his discourse he was ever ready to give honour where honour was due he was moreover an eloquent speaker having an excellent wit and perfect judgment in all things of a most sweet and gentle nature affable and most courteous in manner so that whoever once conversed with him could not choose but love him henceforth forever that is a most loving and splendid tribute for one man to pay another not long after giorgione died and titian took up his unfinished work doing it as well as his own there was a brilliant and mature artist called palma vecchio in venice and titian painted in his studio where he saw and loved vecchios daughter violante the young artist was not very well off financially and therefore could not marry hence he was not specially happy over his love affair about that time he took to painting after the manner of vecchio through being so much influenced by his soft feelings for the older artists daughter he used the lovely violante again and again for his model and many of the beautiful faces which titian painted at that time show the features of his ladylove with his new love titians serious work seemed to begin and at twentyone he painted his first truly great picture sacred and profane love to day this picture hangs upon the walls of the borghese palace in rome raphael painted a great many pictures but titian must have painted more at least one thousand have his signature now came wars and troubles for venice the turks french and venetians became at odds and during the strife many fine works of art were lost among them many of titians pictures he had painted bishops also the wicked borgias and many other great personages but all of these are gone and to this day no one knows what became of them at last titian began one of his greatest paintings the tribute money and he set about it because he had been criticised some german travellers in venice visited titians studio and though they found his work very fine one of them said that after all there was only one master able to finish a painting as it should be finished and that was the great drer the german pointed out the differences between titians method and drers and declared that venetian painters never quite came up to the promise of their first pictures drers wonderful pictures were quite different from titians inasmuch as his work was fuller of detail and careful finishing but titian was as great in another way his effects were broader but quite as satisfying however the german criticism put him on his mettle and he answered that if he had thought the greatest value of a painting lay in its fiddling little details of finishing he too would have painted them to show that he could paint after drers fashion as well as his own he undertook the tribute money and the result was a wonderful picture soon rome sent for titian the florentines raphael and michael angelo were already there doing marvellous things but the pope wished to add the genius of titian to theirs and made him a great offer to go and live in rome and do his future work for that city this was an honour but amid all his fame and the homage paid him titian had remembered the old home in the vale of cadore it was there his heart was and he determined to return to the home of his boyhood to do his best work so he sent his thanks and refusal to the pope and he wrote as follows to his home folks through the council of his town i titian of cadore having studied painting from childhood upward and desirous of fame rather than profit wish to serve the doge and signorini rather than his highness the pope and other signori who in past days and even now have urgently asked to employ me i am therefore anxious if it should appear feasible to paint the hall of council beginning if it pleases their sublimity with the canvas of the battle on the side toward the piazza which is so difficult that no one as yet has had the courage to attempt it then in stating his terms he asked for a very moderate sum of money and a brokerage for life the government did not have to think over the matter long titians father had been honoured among them titians genius was well known and the commission was gladly given him as soon as he got this business affair settled he moved into the palace of the duke of milan at san samuele on the grand canal where he remained for sixteen years so says his biographer titians affairs were not yet entirely smooth because both of the bellinis having painted for his patrons they naturally considered titian an intruder and thought that the work should have been given to them they did all they could to make trouble for the younger artist but after a time titian came into his rights receiving his brokerage which gave to him a yearly sum of money 120 crowns 12604 his taxes were taken off for the future provided he would agree to paint all the doges that should rule during his lifetime titian undertook to do this but he did not keep his word for he painted only five doges though many more followed he had no sooner received his commission from the council of his native place than he began to neglect it and to paint for the husband of the wicked poisonerlucretia borgiawhose name was alfonso deste the duke of ferrara it was for him he painted the venus worship now in the museum of madrid also the three ages which belongs to lord ellesmere and the virgins rest near bethlehem now in the national gallery afterward he painted noli me tangere which is in the same london gallery there is a picture of great size in the academy of arts in venice which was first seen on a public holiday nearly four hundred years ago it is the assumption of the virgin first shown on st bernardinos day when all the public offices were closed by order of the senate and the whole city had a gay time this occasion made titian the most honoured artist of his time but still the venetians had cause to complain because now their painter took so much work in hand that he nearly ceased doing the work on the council hall the council sent him word that unless he attended to business the paintings should be finished by some one else and he would have to pay the new artist out of his own pocket but in waywardness he paid no attention to this summons lucretia borgia died and her husband having never loved her fell at once in love with a girl of a lower class who was very good and worthy to be loved the duke wanted titian to paint them both and so once more the great painter neglected his contract with the council the girls name was laura and titian painted her and the duke in one picture which now hangs in the louvre at last after seven years of his neglecting to do his promised work the council became enraged and threatened to take the artists property away from him that frightened titian very much and he began frantically to work on the battle piece on the hall wall it was about this time that he married he had probably forgotten violante in the passing of so many years at any rate it was not she whom he married but a lady whose first name was cecilia soon he had a little family of children but one of them was destined to make titian very unhappy this was pomponic who became a priest but he was also a wicked spendthrift and kept his father forever in trouble trying to pay his debts and keep him out of scrapes another son became an artist not great like his father but very helpful and a comfort to him then his wife died and titian had loved her so dearly that for a long time he had not the heart to paint much his sister orsa came to live at his home and take care of his motherless children he left the palace on the grand canal and bought a home north of venice with beautiful gardens attached and there he lived and worked entertaining the most illustrious men titians house and gardens became the show place of the country so many geniuses and famous people visited there it was there that he painted the martyrdom of saint peter and the picture was so loved by the venetians that the signori threatened with death any one who should take the picture from the chapel where it hung in spite of this caution the picture was burned in the fire that destroyed the chapel in 1867 titian was now getting to be old but he was yet to do great work and to have kingly patrons charles v visited bologna and seeing titians great work wanted him to paint his portrait so the artist went to bologna and painted the portrait of the king clothed in armour but without any headcovering making charles v look so fine a personage that he was delighted charles said he had always been painted to look so much uglier than he really was that when people who had seen his portraits actually saw himself they were pleasantly disappointed while titian was painting his picture lombardi the sculptor wished above all things to see charles so titian said you come with me to the sittings and act as if you were some apprentice carrying my colours and brushes and then you can watch the king as easily as possible lombardi did as titian suggested but he hid in his big and baggy sleeve a tablet of wax on which to make a relief picture of charles one day the king surprised the sculptor and demanded to be shown what he was doing thereupon he was so much pleased that he commissioned lombardi to make the model in marble while the king was sitting for two portraits to titian the artist one day dropped his brush the king looked at the courtiers who were lounging about watching the work but none of them picked it up so the king himself did so titian was distressed over this and apologised to the king there may be many kings said charles but there will never be more than one titianand he deserves to be served by caesar himself after that he would allow no other artist to paint his portrait declaring that titian alone could do it properly and for the two pictures titian received two thousand scudi in gold was made a count of the lateran palace of the aulic council and of the consistory with the title of count palatine and all the advantages attached to those dignities his children were thereby raised to the rank of nobles of the empire with all the honours appertaining to families with four generations of ancestors he was also made knight of the golden spur with the right of entrance to court this was great return for two portraits of a king but it shows what a king could do if he chose titian had a brother who also became an artist less famous than himself and it was that brother who when their father died in the cadore home went back to care for the old place and to keep it in readiness so that the famous titian might return to it for rest and peace foreign sovereigns had invited titian to end his days with them but they could not tempt him from that vale of cadore nor his country home in venice all this time he had been neglecting the work upon the hall of council and at last the councillors gave the work to another took away titians brokerage and told him he must return to venice all the moneys they had given him for twenty years back this finally cured him of his neglect and he went to work in earnest painting so rapidly that he finished the work in two years before he died titian went to rome where he painted pope pauls portrait and the story is told that when the portrait was set to dry upon the terracewhich it probably was notthe people who passed took off their hats to it thinking it was the pope himself besides his bad son and his good one titian had a beautiful daughter whom he painted again and again he went to augsburg once more to paint king charles who for that work added a pension of five hundred scudi to what he had already done for him this made the artist as rich as a prince instead of poor as a painter king philip ii loved art as his father had and he took a painting of titians with him to the convent of yuste where he went to die wishing to have it near to console him in those days art had become a religion for high and low great personages still went to casa grande titians venetian home where he entertained like a prince no one knew better than he how princes behaved and when a cardinal came to dine with him he threw his purse to his servant crying prepare a feast for all the world is dining with me henry iii of france visited titian and ordered sent to him every picture of which he had asked the price his friends stood by him all his life but in his old age his beautiful daughter lavinia died leaving behind her six children for him to love as his own the brother had died before that in the old home at cadore and at more than eighty years of age titian was still painting from morning till night about this time he sent to king philip the last supper which was to be hung in the escorial the monks found it too high to fill the space and though the artist in charge navarrette begged them to let it be they cut a piece off the top that it might be hung where they wanted it titian had so far had to pay no taxes but at that time an account of his property was demanded and this is what he owned several houses pieces of land sawmills and the like and he was blamed because he did not state the full value of his possessions at ninetyone he painted a picture which became the guide of rubens and his brother artists so wonderful was it again at ninetynine he began a picture which was to be given to the monks of the frari in return for a burial place for the artist within the convent walls but he never finished it he died during the time of the plague but of old age alone though his son orzio died of the disease the alarm of the people was so great that a law had been passed to bury all who died at that time instantly and without ceremony but that law was waived for the painter titian in the midst of a nations tragedy was borne to the convent of the frari with honours two centuries later the austrian emperor commanded the great sculptor canova to make a mausoleum above the tomb it was said that shortly before he died titian began to be less sure in his use of colours and would often daub on great masses but his students came in the night and rubbed them off so that the master never felt his failing as king charles had said there was never but one such artist in the world titian prepared his canvas by painting upon it a solid colour to serve for the bed upon which the picture itself was to be painted to quote more exactly from a good descriptionsome of these foundation colours were laid on with resolute strokes of his brush which was heavily laden with colour while the halftints were made with pure red earth the lights with pure white softened into the rest of the foundation painting with touches of the same brush dipped into red black and yellow in this way he could give the promise of a figure in four strokes after laying this foundation he turned his picture toward the wall and left it there for months at a time frequently turning it around that he might criticise it if during this time of waiting he thought any part of the work already done was poor he made it right changing the shape of an arm adding flesh where he thought it was needed reducing flesh where it seemed to him out of proportion and then he would again turn the canvas face to the wall after months of selfcriticism and retouching he would have the first layer of flesh painted upon his figures and a good beginning made it was contrary to his habit to finish at one painting and he used to say that a poet who improvises cannot hope to form pure verses he would often produce a halflight with a rub of his finger or with a touch of the thumb he would dab a spot of dark pigment into some corner to strengthen it or throw in a reddish strokea tear of blood so to speakto break the parts in fact when finishing he painted more with his fingers than with his brush he used to say white red and black these are all the colours that a painter needs but one must know how to use them platethe artists daughter lavinia previous to the time of titian it had been the custom to paint portraits of beautiful ladies merely to their waists just far enough to show their hands he went further and produced knee portraits which gave him an opportunity to paint their gorgeous gowns as well he has done so in making this picture of his daughter lavinia probably just before her marriage to cornelio sarcinelli which took place in 1555 she is attired in goldcoloured brocade with pearls about her neck her dress combined with the dish of fruit she holds so high gives titian the colour effects he always sought a yellow lemon is specially striking and the red curtain to the left harmonises with the whole the uplift of the arms and the turn of the head give the desired amount of action it is not titians customary style of work he seldom did anything so intimate and personal and the picture is the more interesting on that account it is in the berlin gallery some of titians famous pictures are his own portrait flora holy family and st bridget the last judgment the entombment the magdalene bacchanal st sebastian bacchus and ariadne and the sleeping venus xxxix joseph mallord william turner english 17751851 pupil of the royal academy if the occupation of a shepherd produced a poet no less did an artist of the first water come out of a barber shop turners father was a jolly little fellow who dressed hair for english dandies and did all of those things which in those days fell to men of his profession it was in this little shop that the great artist grew up father turner was ambitious for his son who was anxious to study art the less said of the artists mother the better for she was a termagant and finally went crazy so that the father and his little boy were soon left alone to plan and work and strive to make each other happy the pair were never apart turners art beginning was at six years of age on the occasion of a visit his father paid to a goldsmith of whose hair curling and peruquing he had charge perched upon a chair too high for a little boys comfort and feeling that it took his father very long indeed to satisfy the customer josephs eye lighted upon a silver lion which ornamented a silver tray he studied every detail of that lion while waiting for his father and finally when they got home he sat down and drew it from memory by tea time he had a lion in full action upon the paper this delighted his father above everything and it was settled then and there that the little fellow should have a chance to learn art the father could not give much time to his upbringing but he taught him to be honest and kindhearted and to save his money his playground was generally the bank of the thames and under london bridge where roving with the sailors he learned to love the ships the settingsuns and evening waters from a daily study of them he did not do much at school because the other pupils at new brentford learning that he could draw wonderful things upon the schoolroom walls used to do his sums for him while he sketched for them after a while father turner began to hang up some of his sons sketches upon the walls of the barber shop among the wigs and curls and toupes and he put little tags upon them telling the price the extraordinary work of his little boy began to attract the attention of the jolly barbers patrons and by the time he was twelve years old the child had a picture upon the walls of the royal academya farcry from barber shop to academy one authority says that this first exhibition occurred in his fourteenth year but by that time he was a pupil of the academy and it is not unlikely that he had shown his mettle before he now began to earn his own living but he still dwelt in the barber shop with his father while in the academy he coloured prints made backgrounds for other painters drew architects plans and in that way made money he had been sent to a drawing master to study the art of perspective but having no mathematical knowledge he had been unable to learn it and the teacher had advised his father to put little turner to cobbling or making clothes however william was to learn perspective and even to be made master of that branch of art in the academy itself in after years when he had become a great artist someone spoke pityingly of the drudgery he had had to do to make money as a young boyreferring to his painting of backgrounds and the like well and what could be better practice turner answered cheerfully he used to go to the house of dr munro who lived in fine style on the strand this gentleman owned rembrandts rubenses titians and other great masterpieces and in that house the little barber had a chance to see the best of art and also to copy it this was a great opportunity for him and he made the most of it besides the chance for study he earned about half a crown an evening and his supper for his copying turner was the first painter to make warm moonlight all other artists had given cold silvery effects to a moonlit atmosphere but turner had seen a mellow sympathetic moon and he first showed it to others about this time he went travelling for an engraver of the copper plate magazine had engaged the young boy to go into wales and make sketches for his work turner set off on a pony which a friend had lent him with his baggage done up in a bundleit did not make a very big oneand thus he voyaged it was a fine experience and he came home with many beautiful scenes on paper which he in after years made into complete pictures next he made the acquaintance of thomas girtin the first in his country of a fine school of watercolour painters and this acquaintance grew into a close friendship the two were devoted to each other and worked together at any sort of mechanical art work that would bring them a living when girtin died turner said had tim girtin lived i should have starved showing how highly he valued girtins work turner is said to have been a stout clumsy little fellow who never cared how he looked he wore an illfitting suit and his luggage tied up in a handkerchief was slung over his shoulder on a cane sometimes he carried a small valise and an old umbrella the handle of which he converted into a fishing rod for turner dearly loved both hunting and fishing the hero travelled a great deal because above every thing he loved the fields and streams and to tramp alone it is said that it was his habit to walk twentyfive miles a day seeing everything on the way letting no peculiarity of nature escape him his sketchbook was a curiosity because he not only made sketches in it but jotted down his travelling expenses what he thought about things that he saw and all the gossip he heard in the towns through which he passed because he liked best to travel alone he was called the great hermit of nature one memorable dayof which he thought but little at the timehe stopped on the road to make a sketch of norham castle later he completed the picture and it became famous so successful that from that hour he had all the work he could do years afterward when passing that way again in company with a friend he was seen to take off his hat to the castle why are you doing that his friend asked in amazement well that castle laid the foundation of my success he answered and i am pleased to salute it during his young manhood turner had fallen in love with a girl and planned to marry but after he returned from one of his country trips he found she had married another and from that moment the artist was a changed man he had been generous and gay before now he began to save his money so that people thought him miserlybut he was forgiven when it became known what he finally did with his fortune after the young woman deserted him he wandered more than ever and one of his fancies was to keep boys from robbing birds nests he looked after the little birds so carefully that the boys named him old blackbirdy he had already begun those wonderful pictures of ships and seas and his house was ornamented with fullrigged little ships and water plants which he carefully raised to put into his pictures by that time he had bought a home of his own in the country and his father the barber went to live with him the old mans trade had fallen off because the fashions had changed wigs were less worn and hair was not so elaborately dressed in the country home the old man took charge of all the household affairs prepared his sons canvases for him and after the pictures were painted it was the exbarber who varnished them so that turner said father begins and finishes all my pictures there the father and son lived in perfect peace and affection till turner decided to sell the place and move into town because said he dad is always working in the garden and catching cold meanwhile he had been made master of perspective in the academy and it was expected that he would lecture to the students but he was not cut out for a lecturer he was not elegant in his manners nor impressive in his speech on one occasion when he had risen to deliver a speech he looked helplessly about him and finally blurted out gentlemen ive been and left my lecture in the hackney coach during these years he had tried to establish a studio like other masters and to have pupils and apprentices about him but the stupid ones he could not endure having no patience with them and he treated all the fashionable ones so bluntly they would not stay so the idea had to be given up he became a visitor at farnley hall in yorkshire where a friend mr hawksworth fawkes lived and in the course of his lifetime fawkes put fifty thousand dollars worth of turners pictures upon his walls the fawkes family described turner as a most delightful man the fun frolic and shooting we enjoyed together and which whatever may be said by others of his temper and disposition have proved to me that he was in his hours of distraction from his professional labours as kindly hearted a man and as capable of enjoyment and fun of all kinds as any i ever knew another friend writes of all lighthearted merry creatures i ever knew turner was the most so and the laughter and fun that abounded when he was an inmate of our cottage was inconceivable particularly with the juvenile members of our family the story of his disappointment in marriage is an interesting one it is said that the young lady whom he loved was the sister of a schoolmate they had been engaged for some time but while he was on one of his travels his letters were stolen and kept from the young woman she believed he had forgotten her and her stepmother who had taken the letters persuaded the girl to engage herself to another turner returned just a week before her marriage and tried to win her back but although she loved him she felt herself then bound to her new suitor and therefore married him her marriage was very unhappy and her misery as well as his own distressed the artist till his death almost all his life in spite of his seeming gaiety he worked like a slave rising at four oclock in the morning and working while light lasted when remonstrated with about this he would sadly say there are no holidays for me all his ways were honest and simple and his election to the academy was very exceptional in the way it came about most academicians had graces and airs and good fellowship to commend them as well as their works but turner had none of these things he had given no dinners nor played a social part in order to get the membership when the news was brought him that he was elected some one advised him to go and thank his fellow academicians for the honour as that was the custom but turner saw no reason in it since i am elected it must have been because they thought my pictures made me worthy why then should i thank them why thank a man for performing a simple duty in half a century turner was absent only three times from the academy exhibitions and his membership was of very great value to him at this time turner had an idea for an art publication to be called liber studiorum he meant to issue this in dark blue covers and to include in each number five plates there was to be a series of five hundred plates altogether and these were to be divided according to subject into historical landscape pastoral mountainous marine and architectural studies after seventy plates had been published the enterprise fell through because no one bought the periodical and there was no money to keep it going the engraver of the plates charles turner became so disgusted with the failure that he even used the proofs of these wonderful studies to kindle the fire with many years later a great printdealer colnaghi made turner the engraver hunt up all the proofs that he had not used for kindling paper and these he bought for 1500 good god cried charles turner i have been burning banknotes all my life some years later still 3000 was paid for a single copy of the liber studiorum turner was a most conscientious man and many stories are told of his manner of teaching he could not talk eloquently nor give very clear instructions talking not being his forte but he would lean over a students shoulder point out the defects in his work and then on a paper beside him make a few marks to illustrate what he had said if the artist had genius enough then to imitate him well and good if not turner simply went away and left him his own ways of working were remarkable he often painted with a sponge and used his thumbnail to tear up a sea it mattered little to him how he produced his effects so long as he did it his impressionistic style confused many of his critics and it is told how a fine lord once looked at a picture be had made and snorted nothing but daubs nothing but daubs then catching the inspiration he leaned close to the canvas and said no painting so it is i find mr turner said a lady that in copying your pictures touches of red blue and yellow appear all through the work well madam dont you see that yourself in nature because if you dont heaven help you was the reply once after painting a summer evening he thought that the picture needed a dark spot in front by way of contrast so he cut out a dog from black paper and stuck it on that dog still appears in the picture another time he painted a snowstorm at sea which some critics called soapsuds and whitewash turner who had been for hours lashed to the mast of a ship in order to catch the proper effect was naturally much hurt by the criticism what would they have he exclaimed i wonder what they think a storm is like i wish theyd been in it turner was conscientiously fond of his work and when he sold a picture he said that he had lost one of his children he grew rich but he never was knighted because his manners were not fine enough to suit the king he wished to become president of the royal academy but that was impossible because he was not polished enough to carry the honour gracefully after selling his place in the country turner bought a house in harley street where he lived a strange and lonely life a gentleman has written about this incident which shows us his manner of living two ladies called upon turner while he lived in harley street on sending in their names after having ascertained that he was at home they were politely requested to walk in and were shown into a large sittingroom without a fire this was in the depth of winter and lying about in various places were several cats without tails in a short time our talented friend made his appearance asking the ladies if they felt cold the youngest replied in the negative her companion more curious wished she had stated otherwise as she hoped they might have been shown into his sanctum or studio after a little conversation he offered them biscuits which they partook of for the noveltysuch an event being almost unprecedented in his house one of the ladies bestowing some notice upon the cats he was induced to remark that he had seven and that they came from the isle of man thus we learn that turners desolate house was full of manx cats and of many other pets when he had moved elsewhereto 47 queen anne streetone of the pictures he cared most for bligh shore was put up as a covering to the window and a cat wishing to come in scratched it hopelessly the housekeeper started to punish it for this but turner said indulgently oh never mind and saved the cat from chastisement the place he lived in where his dad was always working in the garden and catching cold he called solus lodge because he wished his acquaintances to understand that he wanted to be alone one picture painted by him to order was to have brought him 2500 but when it was finished the man was disappointed with it and would not take it later turner was offered 8000 for it but would not sell it turner again fell in love but his bashfulness ruined his chances he wrote to the brother of the lady if she would only waive her bashfulness or in other words make an offer instead of expecting one the same solus lodge might change occupiers faint heart certainly did not win fair lady in this case for she married another before he died turner was offered 25000 for two pictures which he would not sell no he said i have willed them and cannot sell them he disposed of several great works as legacies one picture of which he was very fond carthage was the occasion of an amusing anecdote chantry he said to his friend the sculptor i want you to promise that when i am dead you will see me rolled in that canvas when im buried all right said chantry ill do it but ill promise to have you taken up and unrolled also a remarkable incident of generosity is told of turner in 1826 he hung two exquisite pictures in the academy one cologne having a most beautiful golden effect this was hung between two portraits by sir thomas lawrence the golden colouring of turners picture entirely destroyed the effect of the lawrence pictures and without a word turner washed his lovely picture over with lampblack this gave the lawrence pictures their full colour value a friend who had been enthusiastic about the cologne was provoked with turner what in the world did you do that for he demanded well poor lawrence was so unhappy it will all wash off after the exhibition turner had his reward in cash for the picture sold for 2000 guineas above all things turner hated engravings or any process that cheapened art and one day he stated this to his friend lawrence i dont choose to be a basket engraver he declared what do you mean by that sir thomas inquired why when i got off the coach t other day at hastings a woman came up with a basket of your mrs peel and offered to sell me one for a sixpence turner dearly loved his friends and the story of chantrys death illustrates it he was in his room when the sculptor breathed his last and just as he died the artist turned to another friend george jones and with tears streaming down his face wrung joness hand and rushed from the room unable to speak again when william frederick wells another friend died turner rushed to the house of clara wells his daughter and cried oh clara clara these are iron tears i have lost the best friend i ever had in my life in his old age turner suddenly disappeared from all his haunts and his friends could not find him they were much troubled but one day his old housekeeper found a note in a pocket of an old coat which made her think he had gone to chelsea she looked there for him and found him very ill in a little cottage on the thames river everybody about called him admiral booth believing him to be a retired admiral he had felt his death near and had tried to meet it quite alone he died the very day after his friends found him as he was being wheeled by them to the window to look out upon the river for the last time he was buried in st pauls cathedral between sir joshua reynolds and james barry he left his drawings and pictures to a turner gallery and 100000 to the royal academy to be used for a medal to be struck every two years for the best exhibitor the rest of his fortune went to care for poor and decayed male artists born in england and of english parents only this was to be known as turners gift and that is why he had saved money all his life a few more of the numberless stories of his generosity should be told a picture had been sent to the academy by a painter named bird it was very fine and turner was full of its praise but when they came to hang it no place could be found it cant be hung the others of the committee said it must be hung returned turner but nothing could be done about it for there was absolutely no place then turner went aside with the picture and sat studying it a long time finally he got up took down a picture of his own and hung birds in its place there he said it is hung again an old drawingmaster died and turner who had known the family for a long time was aware that they were destitute so he gave the widow a good sum of money with which to bury her husband and to meet general expenses after some time she came to him with the money but turner put his hands in his pockets no he said keep it use it to send the children to school and to church on one occasion when he had irritably sent a beggar from his house he ran out and called her back thrusting a 5 note into her hand before letting her go there was a man who in turners youth while the little fellow was making pictures in the cheerless barber shop bought all of these drawings he could find he often raised the price and in every way tried to help turner in after years that old patron went bankrupt turner heard that his steward had been instructed to cut down some fine old trees on this mans estate and sell them turner without letting himself be known in the matter at once stopped the cutting and put into his old patrons hands about 20000 the rescued man afterward through the same channels that he had received the money paid it all back years passed and the son of that same man got into the same difficulties and again without being known in the matter turner restored his fortune that son in his turn honestly paid back the full amount this was the miser who saved all his moneyto do good deeds to his friends ruskin wrote that in all his life he had never heard from turner one unkind or blameful word for others platethe fighting tmraire this was the picture which turner loved best of all the one he would never sell but at his death ho gave it to the english nation many years before he painted it he had gone down to portsmouth one day to see nelsons fleet come in after the glorious victory of trafalgar the tmraire was pointed out to hima battle ship that had very proudly borne the english flag for during the battle it had run in between two french frigates and captured them both and now between thirty and forty years later he lingered one afternoon on the banks of the thames as he looked over the water he saw the grand old hulk being towed down the river by a noisy little tug to be broken up at deptford theres a fine subject he exclaimed as he looked at the heroic ship that had known many glorious years and in his thought he compared it to a battlescarred warrior borne to the grave then he painted the picture the glow of the setting sun irradiates the scene and bids farewell to the old ship twilight is coming on and the new moon has just risen in its pearly light it is a pathetic picture and well illustrates how truly a master of sunsets and waves the artist was among his other paintings are several of venice the slave ship and many other sea pieces xl sir anthony van dyck flemish school 15991641 pupil of rubens anthony van dykes father was neither a gentleman nor an illborn person he was betwixtandbetween being a silk merchant who met so many fine folk that he seemed to be fine folk himself and by the time anthony had grown up he actually believed himself to be one of them if manners stand for fineness sir anthony must have been superfine because he was almost overburdened with manners he became a wonderful belaced perfumed shiny gentleman who never stooped to paint anything less than royalty and its associates nor in anything less than velvets and laces like rembrandt and gainsborough he set a fashionor rather the style in which he painted came to be known after his name we are all familiar with the kind of ornamentation on clothes called van dyckpointed lace or trimmingsand pointed beards as a very young lad he was almost too dainty to be liked by healthy boys and the worst of it was he did not care whether healthy robust chaps liked him or not certainly he did not care for them he liked to sit in his fathers shop and be smiled upon by the great ladies who came to buy and in turn to smile shyly at them this tendency became stronger as he grew to be a man anthonys mother made the most exquisite embroideries and this may mean that some part of his art was inherited she handled lovely colours and tried to fashion beautiful flower shapes for customers she was a fragile tender sort of woman while the father was doubtless a dapper overnice little fellow anthony was born in antwerp and the facts concerning his education as in the case of most artists are lost to our knowledge he probably had a little of some sort outside of painting but it certainly was not enough to hurt him nor to make a fine healthy man of him he was very beautiful in a ladylike faintcoloured way not in the least resembling the handsome gorgeous elegant robust rubens a true cavalier of a dashing sort he was apprenticed to a painter when he was ten years old and later on became the pupil of rubens he painted a whole series of apostles heads about which a lawsuit took place the papers relating to this were found about twenty years ago though the lawsuit occurred as far back as 1615 several of the apostles heads that brought about the suit are today to be seen in the gallery at dresden everything in those daysespecially in germany and hollandwas represented by a guild in reading about the mastersingers of nuremberg we are told that on the day when the trial of singers was to take place dozens of guilds assembled in the meadowguilds of bakers of shoemakersof which hans sachs was the headguilds of goldsmiths etc van dyck was a member of the painters guild when he was no more than nineteen his work at that time showed so much strength that there is a picture of his an old gentleman and lady in the dresden gallery which for a long time was supposed to have been painted by his master rubens an intimate friend of van dyck kenelm digby says that van dycks first relations with rubens came about by van dyck being employed to make engravings for the reproduction of rubenss great works after that he studied painting with him one of his friends of that time wrote that at twenty van dyck was nearly as great as rubens though this is hardly substantiated by the verdict of time and that being a man with very rich family connections he could hardly be expected to leave home on every hand we have signs of the artists affected feeling about himself and other people however an annual pension from the king of england seems to have made travelling possible to this fine gentleman of lace ruffles pale face and ladylike ways there is an entry about him on the royal account book of special service performed for his majesty also antonio van dyck gent his majestys servant is allowed to travaile 8 months he havinge obtayneid his majestys leave in that behalf as was signified to the e of arundel certainly by that time van dyck had become a truly great portrait painter not the greatest because every picture showed the same characteristics in its subjectelegance fine clothes languid manners without force of great truth or any excellent moral quality to distinguish one from another nevertheless the kind of painting that he did he did better than anyone else had ever done or probably ever will do while in england he painted all the royalties and many aristocrats and wherever he went he was always painting pictures of himself he travelled about a good deal always painting people of the same classkings and queens and fine folk and painting them pretty nearly all alike when he went to italy he was everywhere received as a great painter but while artists agreed that his work was excellent he was not much liked by them and many tales are told about that journey which are interesting if not entirely true van dyck was the sort of man about whom tales would be made up one however sounds true it is said that he fell in lovewhich of course he was always doingwith a beautiful country girl and that for love of her he painted an altar piece into which he put himself seated on the great gray horse which rubens had given him that picture is in st martins church at saventhem near brussels but although one is inclined to believe this story because it was quite the sort of thing which might be expected of van dyck even this is not true because the painting was done long after the artist had made his italian journey and it was commissioned by a gentleman living at saventhem whose daughter van dyck undoubtedly liked pretty well but he made the picture for money not for love while he was in italy he lived with a cardinal and painted languid pictures of sacred subjects which were far from being his best work the best that he did was in portraiture distinguished though he was he did not have a very good time in italy because he would not join the artists who worked there nor associate with them in the least and naturally this made him disliked we see a good many portraits painted by van dyck of persons mounted upon or standing beside the gray horse and these were painted about the time of that italian journey he used the rubens horse in many paintings of all the people with whom he painted he most valued the knowledge he got from a blind woman painter of sicily called sofonisba anguisciola and he often said that he had learned more from a blind woman than from all the openeyed men he ever knew this woman artist was over ninety years old at the time he learned from her while he was in italy the plague broke out and van dyck fled for his life leaving an unfinished picture behind him one ordered by the english king the subject being rinaldo and armida which had gained for the artist his knighthood pension it is said that during his first year in england he painted the king and queen twelve times he had an extraordinary record for industry and painted very quickly as he had need to do because it took a great deal of money to buy the sort of things van dyck likedfine laces and velvets perfumes and satins his plan was to sketch his subject first on gray paper with black and white chalk and after that he gave the sketch to an assistant who increased it to the size he wished to paint the next step was to set his painter to work upon the clothing of his figures this was painted in roughly together with background and any architectural effect van dyck wanted after this the artist himself sat down and in three or four sittings of not more than an hour each he was able to finish a picture worth today thousands of dollars he painted hands specially well and kept certain models for them alone van dyck had eleven brothers and sisters whom he always kept in mind some of his sisters had become nuns while some of his brothers were priests and van dycks influence got a monkish brother called to the dutch court to act as chaplain to the queen by this time every royal personage in the world nearly had sent for van dyck to paint his portrait for he could make one look handsomer than could any other painter in existence if the king was very ugly van dyck painted such beautiful clothes upon him that nobody noticed the plainness of the features when van dyck was about thirtysix years old he married a great lady the lady mary ruthven granddaughter of the earl of gowrie but before that he had had a ladylove margaret lemon whom he painted as the virgin and in several other pictures when he married lady mary margaret lemon was so furiously jealous that she tried to injure van dycks right hand so that he could paint no more about this time rubens died in flanders leaving behind him an unfinished series of pictures which had been commissioned by the king of spain van dyck was asked to finish these but declined until he was asked to make an independent picture to complete the series and this he was delighted to do ferdinand of austria wrote to the king of spain that van dyck had returned in great haste to london to arrange for his change of home in order to do the work possibly he may still change his mind he added for he is stark mad this shows how van dycks erratic ways appeared to some people he had a sister justiniana who was also something of an artist and she married a nobleman when she was about twelve years old when van dyck died he was buried in st pauls london and charles i placed an inscription on his tomb in the young peoples story of art is the following anecdote a visit was once paid by a courtly looking stranger passing through haarlem to franz hals the distinguished dutch painter hals was not at home but he was sent for to the tavern and hastily returned the stranger told him that he had heard of his reputationhad just two hours to spareand wished to have his portrait painted hals seizing canvas and brushes fell vigorously to work and before the given time had elapsed he said have the goodness to rise sir and examine your portrait the stranger looked at it expressed his satisfaction and then said painting seems such a very easy thing suppose we change places and see what i can do hals assented and took his position as the sitter the unknown began and as hals watched him he saw that he wielded the brush so quickly he must be a painter his work too was rapidly finished and as hals looked at it he exclaimed you must be van dyck no one else could paint such a portrait no two portraits could have been more unlike the story adds that the famous dutch and flemish masters heartily embraced each other the stories of van dycks youth are interesting and probably true it is said that he drew so well when he was a pupil of rubens that the great master often allowed him to retouch his own works once in rubenss studio some of the students got the key and went in to see what the master was doing when he was absent rubens had left a painting fresh upon the easel and in looking about them one of the boys rubbed against it this frightened them all what should they do rubens would find his picture ruined and know that they had broken in after consultation they decided there was no one with them who could repair the damage as well as van dyck who set about it and soon he had painted in the smudged part so perfectly that when rubens saw it he did not for some time know that anything had happened to his picture later he suspected something and when he learned of the prank and its outcome he was so delighted with van dycks work that he praised him instead of blaming him for it van dyck had a very precise method of working when sitters came to him he would paint for just one hour then he would politely dismiss them and his servant would wash his brushes and clear the way for the next sitter he dined with his sitters often that he might surprise in them the expression which he wanted to paint also he had their clothing sent to his studio that it might be exactly imitated by himself or by those assistants who painted in the foundation for his finished work while attached to king charles is court van dyck was given a fine house at blackfriars on the thames and he had a private landing place made for boats so that the royal family might visit him at their convenience charles i used often to go to van dycks studio to escape his many troubles and thus the artists home became as fashionable a gathering place as gainsboroughs studio was in bath he painted queen henrietta not less than twentyfive times he often furnished concerts for his sitters for he himself was passionately fond of music and moreover he believed that music often brought to the faces of his sitters an expression that he loved to paint he painted so many pictures of a certain kind of little dog in the pictures of king charles i that ever since that breed has been known as the king charles spaniel after a while van dyck got heavily into debt king charles himself was in great trouble and he had no money with which to pay his painters pension the artist had lived so extravagantly that he did not know at last which way to turn so in desperation he thought to try alchemy and maybe to learn the secret of making gold he wasted much time at this as cleverer men have done but at last he became too ill for that or for his own proper work and badly off though charles was himself he offered his court physician a large sum if he could cure his court painter but van dyck had enjoyed life too well and nothing could be done for him he was the seventh child of his parentswhich some have thought had something to do with his genius and success he lived gaily all the years of his life going restlessly from place to place and having many acquaintances but probably few friends outside of his old master rubens who loved him for his genius platechildren of charles the first van dyck painted the family of the unfortunate king of england four times there are five children in the windsor castle picture and this one which hangs in the turin gallery was probably painted before the birth of the fourth child in 1636 it is celebrated for its colouring as well as for its great artistic merit the children are surely childlike enough despite their stately attire and they little dream of the sad fate awaiting the whole of the stuart family to which they belong other van dycks are the blessed herman joseph lords digby and russell lord wharton countess folkestone and william prince of orange xli velasquez diego rodriguez de silva pronounced vaylahsketh castilian school 15991669 pupil of herrera it is pretty difficult to find out why a man was named soandso in the days of the early italian and spanish painters more likely than not they would be called after the master to whom they had been first apprenticed or after their trade after the town from which they came and rarely because their father had had the name before them in velasquezs case he was named after his mother no one seemed to be certain what to call him but he generally wrote his name diego de silva velasquez his father was rodriguez de silva a lawyer but in calling the boy velasquez the family followed a universal spanish custom of naming children after their mothers little velasquez was well taught in his childhood he studied many languages and philosophy for he was intended to be a lawyer or something learned anything but a painter the disappointment of parents in those days when they found a child was likely to become an artist is touching despite his equipment for a useful life according to the ideas of his parents this little chap was bound to become nothing but a maker of pictures herrera was a badtempered master and little velasquez could not get on with him so after a year of harsh treatment he went to another master pacheco but by that time he had learned a secret that was to help make his work great herrera had taught him to use a brush with very long bristles which had the effect of spreading the paint making it look as if his colours had floated upon the canvas in a way that was the despair of those who came after him velasquez was born in seville at a time when about all the art of the world was italian or german thus he became the creator of a new school of painting he stayed five years in pachecos studio and pupil and master became very fond of each other pacheco was not a great masternot so good as herrerabut he was easy to get on with and knew a good deal about painting so that as velasquez had the genius he was as well placed as he needed to be in pachecos studio there was a peasant boy whose face was very mobile showed every passing feeling and velasquez used to make him laugh and weep till surprising some good expression he would quickly sketch him with this excellent model velasquez did a surprising amount of good work spain had just then conquered the faroff provinces of mexico and peru and was continually receiving from its newly got lands much valuable merchandise rapidly growing rich this latin country loved art and all things beautiful so its money was bound to be spent freely in such ways madrid had been made its capital and at that time there were few fine pictures to be found there the moors who had conquered spain had forbidden picture making because it was contrary to their religion to represent the human figure or even the figures of birds and beasts then the inquisition had hindered art by its rules one of which was that the virgin mary should always be painted with her feet covered another that all saints should be beardless there were many more exactions while cathedrals were being built elsewhere the moors had been in control of spanish lands so that no cathedral had been built there and when velasquez came upon the scene the time of great cathedral building was past it had ceased to be the fashion although there had been such painters as beneguette morales navarrette and ribera all spanish and of considerable genius they had been too badly handicapped to make painting a great art in spain when madrid became the capital of spain it had no unusual buildings unless it was an old fortress of the moors the alcazar caesars house but the nation was buying paintings from italy and it began to beautify madrid which had the advantage of the former moorish luxury and art very beautiful though not pictorial in madrid then there seemed to be great opportunity for a fine artist like velasquez and his master urged him to go there and try his fortune so he set out on muleback attended by his slave but unless he could get the ear of the king it was useless for him to seek advancement in madrid without the king as patron at that time an artist could not accomplish much after trying again and again velasquez had to return to his old master without having seen the king but after a time a picture of his was seen by philip iv and he was so much pleased with it that he summoned the artist through his minister olivares he offered him 11340 in gold fifty ducats to pay his return expenses the next year he gave him 68040 to move his family to madrid at last the artist had found a place in the rich city and he went to live at the court where the warmest friendship grew between him and the king the latter was an author and something of a painter so that they loved the same things this friendship lasted all their lives and they were together most of the time the king always being found in velasquezs studio in the palace when his duties did not call him elsewhere during the many many yearsnearly thirtyseventhat velasquez lived with philip iv he employed himself in painting the scenes at court thus he became the pictorial historian of the spanish capital he was a man of good disposition kindly and generous in conduct and in feeling so that he was always in the midst of friends and wellwishers philip iv was indeed a noble companion but he was not a gay one being known as the king who never laughedor at least whose laughter was so rare the few times he did laugh became historic one would expect this serious and depressing atmosphere to have had an effect upon a painters art but it chanced that rubens visited spain and there velasquez being the one famous artist it was natural they should become interested in each other rubens told velasquez of the wonders of italian painting till the spaniard could think of nothing else and finally he begged philip to let him journey to italy that he might see some of those wonders for himself the request made the king unhappy at first but at last he gave his consent and velasquez set out for italy the king gave him money and letters of introduction and he went in company with the marquis of spinola after velasquez had stayed eighteen months in italy philip began to long for his friend and sent for him to return he came back full of the stories of brilliant italy and charmed the king completely there is as absurd a story of velasquezs perfection in painting as that of raphaels whose portrait of the pope left upon the terrace to dry imposed upon passers by it is said of velasquezs work that when he had painted an admiral whom the king had ordered to sea and left it exposed in his studio the king entering thought it was the admiral himself and angrily inquired why he had not put to sea according to orders on the face of them these stories are false but they serve to suggest the perfection of these artists paintings philip being a melancholy man had his court full of jesters poor misshapen creaturesdwarfs and hunchbackswho were supposed to appear funny and velasquez as court painter painted those whom he continually saw about him who formed the court family thus we have pictures of strange groupsdwarfs little princesses dressed precisely as the elders were dressed favourite dogs and velasquez himself at his easel in 1618 while still with his master pacheco he had married the masters daughter a big portly woman before he left seville he bad two daughters these were all the children he had although he painted a picture of velasquezs family which includes a great number of people the figures in that painting are the children of his daughter not his own and this may account for one biographers statement that the artist had seven children he was devoted to and happy in his family of children and grandchildren he did not grow rich but received regularly during his life in madrid twenty gold ducats 4536 a month to live upon and besides this his medical attendance lodging and additional payment for every picture the one which brought him this good fortune was an equestrian portrait of philip first uncovered on the steps of san felipe everywhere the people were delighted with it poets sung of it and the king declared no other should ever paint his portrait this picture has long since disappeared in 1627 velasquez won the prize for a picture representing the expulsion of the moors from spain and was rewarded by being appointed gentleman usher to this was shortly afterward added a daily allowance of twelve realsthe same amount which was allowed to court barbersand ninety gold ducats 20412 a year for dress which was also paid to the dwarfs buffoons and players about the kings persontruly a curious estimate of talent at the court of spain the record of philip iv with unpleasing even degenerate characters about him is brightened by the thought of his loyalty to his court painter and lifelong friend when the kings favourites fell those who had been the friends of velasquez the artist loyally remained their friend in adversity as he had been while they were powerful this constancy even to the royal enemies was never resented by philip he honoured the faithfulness of his artist even as he himself was faithful in this friendship philips court was such that there was little to paint that was ennobling and so velasquez lacked the inspiration of such surroundings as the italian painters had philip iv was hailfellowwellmet with his stablemen his huntsmen his cooks and yet he seems to have had no sense of humour was long faced and forbidding to look at and despite his strange habits considered himself the most mighty and haughty man in the world he felt himself free to behave as he chose because he was philip of spain and he chose to do a great many absurd and outrageous things in all philips portraits painted by velasquez he wears a stiff white linen collar of his own invention and he was so proud of this that he celebrated it by a festival he went in procession to church to thank god for the wonderful blessing of the golillathe name of his collar this unsightly thing became the fashion and all portraits of men of that time were painted with it in regard to the wonderful structure of philips moustaches it is said that to preserve their form they were encased during the night in perfumed leather covers called bigoteras such absurdities in a king who had the responsibilities of a nation upon him seem incredible velasquez made in all three journeys to italy and the last one was on a mission for the king which was much to the latters credit philip had determined to have a fine art gallery in madrid for spain had by this time many pictures but no statuary so he commissioned his painter to buy whatever he thought well of and could buy in italy hence the artist set off again with his slavethe same one with whom he had journeyed to madrid so long before his name was pareja and his master had already made an excellent artist of him they went to genoa thence to the great artcentres of italy were received everywhere with honour and the artist bought wisely velasquez did not care for raphaels paintings as much as for titians and he said so to salvator rosa an honoured painter in italy while in rome velasquez painted the pope also his own slave pareja when he returned to spain he took with him three hundred statues but a large number of them were nude and the spanish court not over particular about most things was very particular about naked statues so that after philips death they nearly all disappeared after his return and after the queen had died and philip had married again velasquez was made quartermastergeneral no easy post but not without honour though it interfered with his picture painting a good deal he had to look after the comfort of all the court and to see that the apartments it occupied at home or when it visited were suitable even the powerful king of spain could not make his favourite a belted knight without a commission to inquire into the purity of his lineage on both sides of the house fortunately the pedigree could bear scrutiny as for generations the family was found free from all taint of heresy from all trace of jewish or moorish blood and from contamination from trade or commerce the difficulty connected with the fact that he was a painter was got over by his being painter to the king and by the declaration that he did not sell his pictures the red cross of santiago conferred upon him by philip made velasquez a knight and freed him also from the rulings of the inquisition which directed so largely what artists could and could not do thus it is that we come to have certain great pictures from velasquezs brush which could not otherwise have been painted this action of the king setting free the artist made two schools of art of which the court painter represented one and murillo the other under the command of the church although not so rich perhaps as raphael velasquez lived and died in plenty while murillo the artist of the church of rome was a povertystricken man finally while in the midst of honours and fulfilling his official duty to the court of spain velasquez contracted the disease which killed him the infanta maria theresa was to wed louis xiv and the ceremony was to take place on a swampy little island called the island of pheasants there he went to decorate a pavilion and other places of display he became ill with a fever and died soon after he returned to madrid he made his wife his old master pachecos daughter his executor and was buried in the church of san juan in the vault of fuensalida but within a week his devoted wife was dead and in eight days time she was buried beside him he left his affairsaccounts between him and the courtbadly entangled and it was many years before they were straightened out his many deeds of kindness lived after him he made of his slave a good artist and a devoted friend and by his efforts the slave became a freedman the story of his kindly help to murillo when that exquisite painter came unknown and friendless to madrid has already been told the church where velasquez was buried was destroyed by the french in 1811 and all trace of the resting place of the great spanish artist is forever lost to us he is called not only painter to the king but king of painters plateequestrian portrait of don balthasar carlos philip of spain had long prayed for a son and when at last one was granted him his pride in his young heir was unbounded the little don carlos was not unworthy for he was a cheerful hearty boy trained to horsemanship from his fourth year for his father was a noted rider and had the best instructors for his son the prince was a brave hunter too and we are told that he shot a wild boar when he was but nine years of age in this portrait which is in the museo del prado he is six years old and it was neither the first nor the last that velasquez made of him it was one of the court painters chief duties to see that the heir to the throne was placed upon canvas at every stage of his career and he painted him from two years of age till his lamented death at sixteen the young prince wears in this picture a green velvet jacket with white sleeves and his scarf is crimson embroidered with gold the lively pony is a light chestnut and the foreshortening of its body must be noticed the steady grave eyes of the lad are gazing far ahead as they would naturally be if he were riding rapidly but his princely dignity is shown in his firm seat in the saddle and his manner of holding his marshals batn the great art of the painter is also shown in the way he subordinates the landscape to the figure he will not allow even a tree to come near the young horseman but brings his young activity into vivid contrast with the calm peacefulness of the distant view with the death of don carlos the downfall of his fathers dynasty was assured though for a time his little sister the infanta maria theresa was upheld as the heiress she married louis xiv and had a weary time of it in france velasquez painted her picture too in the grown up dress of the children of that day it is in the vienna gallery among his best known pictures are the surrender of breda alessandro del borro and philip iv xlii paul veronese paolo cagliari pronounced vayronayzay and paholah caleeahree venetian school 15281588 pupil of titian one has never done well enough when one can do better one never knows enough when he can learn more this was the motto of paul veronese this artist was born in veronawhence he took his nameand spent much of his life with the monks in the monastery of st sebastian his father was a sculptor and taught his son veronese himself was a lovable fellow had a kind feeling for all and in return received the good will of most people when he first went to venice to study he took letters of introduction to the monks of st sebastian and finally went to live with them for his uncle was prior of the monastery and it was upon its walls that he did his first work in venice his subject was the story of esther which he illustrated completely he became known in time as the most magnificent of magnificent painters he loved the gaieties of venice the lords and ladies the exquisite colouring the feasting and laughter and everything he painted showed this taste when he chose great religious subjects he dressed all his figures in elegant venetian costumes in the midst of elegant venetian scenes his virgins or other biblical people were not jews of palestine but venetians of venice but so beautiful were they and so inspiring that nobody cared to criticise them on that score he loved to paint festival scenes such as the marriage at cana banquet in levis house or feast in the house of simon he painted nothing as it could possibly have been but everything as he would have liked it to be into the wedding feast at cana where jesus was said to have turned the water into wine he introduced a great host of his friends people then living titian is there and several reigning kings and queens including francis i of france and his bride for whom the picture was made this treatment of the bible story startles the mind but delights the eye it was said that his red recurred like a joyful trumpet blast among the silver gray harmonies of his paintings muther one who has written brilliantly about him tells us that veronese seems to have come into the world to prove that the painter need have neither head nor heart but only a hand a brush and a pot of paint in order to clothe all the walls of the world with oil paintings and that if he paints mary she is not the handmaid of the lord or even the queen of heaven but a woman of the world listening with approving smile to the homage of a cavalier in light red silk morning dress she receives the angel of the annunciation and hears without surprisefor she has already heard itwhat he has to say and at the entombment she only weeps in order to keep up appearances such criticism raises a smile but it is quite just and what is more the veronese pictures are so beautiful that one is not likely to quarrel with the painter for having more good feeling than understanding his joyous temperament came near to doing him harm for he was summoned before the inquisition for the manner in which he had painted the last supper after the esther pictures in st sebastian the artist painted there the martyrdom of st sebastian and there is a tradition that he did his work while hiding in the monastery because of some mischief of which he had been guilty at that time he was not much more than twentysix or eight while the great painter tintoretto was fortyfive yet his work in st sebastian made him as famous as the older artist there is very little known of the private affairs of veronese he signed a contract for painting the marriage at cana for the refectory of the monastery of st giorgio maggiore in june 1562 and that picture stupendous as it is was finished eighteen months later he received 77760 for it as well as his living while he was at work upon it and a tun of wine one picture he is supposed to have left behind him at a house where he had been entertained as an acknowledgment of the courtesy shown him paul had a brother benedetto ten years younger than himself and it is said that he greatly helped paul in his work by designing the architectural backgrounds of his pictures if that is so benedetto must have been an artist of much genius for those backgrounds in the paintings are very fine veronese married and had two sons the younger being named carletto he was also the favourite and an excellent artist who did some fine painting but he died while he was still young gabriele the elder son also painted but he was mainly a man of affairs and attended to business rather than to art veronese was a loving father and brother and beyond doubt a happy man after his death both his sons and his brother worked upon his unfinished paintings completing them for him he was buried in the church of st sebastian platethe marriage at cana this painting is most characteristic of veroneses methods he has no regard for the truth in presenting the picture story at the marriage at cana everybody must have been very simply dressed and there could have been no beautiful architecture such as we see in the picture in the painting we find courtierlike men and women dressed in beautiful silks some of the costumes appear to be a little russian in character the others venetian and jesus himself wears the loose everyday robe of the pastoral people to whom he belonged we think of luxury and rich food and a splendid house when we look at this painting when as a matter of fact nothing of this sort could have belonged to the scene which veronese chose to represent perhaps no painter was more lacking in imagination than was veronese in painting this particular picture he chose to place historical or legendary characters in the midst of a scene which could not have existed coincidently with the event among his other pictures are europa and the bull venice enthroned and the presentation of the family of darius to alexander xliii leonardo da vinci pronounced layonardo dah veenchee florentine school 14511519 pupil of verrocchio leonardo da vinci was the natural son of a notary ser pier and he was born at the castello of vinci near empoli from the very hour that he was apprenticed to his master verrocchio he proved that he was the superior of his master in art da vinci was one of the most remarkable men who ever lived because he not only did an extraordinary number of things but he did all of them well he was an engineer made bridges fortifications and plans which to this day are brilliant achievements he was a sculptor and as such did beautiful work he was a naturalist and as such was of use to the world he was an author and left behind him books written backward of which he said that only he who was willing to devote enough study to them to read them in that form was able to profit by what he had written finally and most wonderfully he was a painter he had absolute faith in himself before he constructed his bridge he said that he could build the best one in the world and a king took him at his word and was not disappointed by the result he stated that he could paint the finest picture in the worldbut let us read what he himself said of it in so sure and superbly confident a way that it robbed his statement of anything like foolish vanity such as he could afford to speak frankly of his greatness without appearing absurd he wrote in time of peace i believe i can equal anyone in architecture in constructing public and private buildings and in conducting water from one place to another i can execute sculpture whether in marble bronze or terra cotta and in painting i can do as much as any other man be he who he may further i could engage to execute the bronze horse in eternal memory of your father and the illustrious house of sforza he was writing to ludovico sforza whose house then ruled at milan if any of the abovementioned things should appear to you impossible or impracticable i am ready to make trial of them in your park or in any other place that may please your excellency to whom i commend myself in proud humility leonardos experiments with oils and the mixing of his pigments has nearly lost to us his most remarkable pictures his first fourteen years of work as an artist were spent in milan where he was employed to paint by the duke of milan and never again was his life so peaceful it was ever afterward full of change he went from milan to venice to rome to florence and back to milan where his greatest work was done while leonardo was a baby he lived in the castle of vinci he was beautiful as a child and very handsome as a man when a child he wore long curls reaching below his waist he was richly clothed and greatly beloved his body seemed no less wonderful than his mind he wished to learn everything and his memory was so wonderful that he remembered all that he undertook to learn his muscles were so powerful that he could bend iron and all animals seemed to love him it is said he could tame the wildest horses indeed his life and accomplishments read as if he were one enchanted one writer tells us that he never could bear to see any creature cruelly treated and sometimes he would buy little caged birds that he might just have the pleasure of opening the doors of their cages and setting them at liberty the story told of his first known work is that his master being hurried in finishing a picture permitted leonardo to paint in an angels head and that it was so much better than the rest of the picture that verrocchio burned his brushes and broke his palette determined never to paint again but probably this is a good deal of a fairy tale and one that is not needed to impress us with the artists greatness since there is so much to prove it without adding fable to fact leonardo was also a very far seeing inventor and most ingenious he made mechanical toys that worked when they were wound up he even devised a miniature flying machine however history does not tell us whether it flew or not he thought out the uses of steam as a motive power long before fultons time leonardo haunted the public streets sketchbook in hand and when attracted by a face would follow till he was able to transfer it to paper ida prentice whitcomb who has compiled many anecdotes of da vinci says that it was also his habit to invite peasants to his house and there amuse them with funny stories till he caught some fleeting expression of mirth which he was pleased to reproduce as a courtier leonardo was elegant and full of amusing devices he sang accompanying himself on a silver lute which he had had fashioned in imitation of a horses skull after he attached himself to the court of the duke of milan his gift of invention was constantly called into use and one of the surprises he had in store for the dukes guests was a great mechanical lion which being wound up would walk into the presence of the court open its mouth and disclose a bunch of flowers inside leonardo worked very slowly upon his paintings because he was never satisfied with a work and would retouch it day after day then too he was a man of moods like most geniuses and could not work with regularity the picture of the last supper was painted in milan by order of his patron the duke and there are many picturesque stories written of its production it was painted upon the refectory wall of a dominican convent the santa maria delle grazie and at first the work went off well and the artist would remain upon his scaffolding from morning till night absorbed in his painting it is said that at such times he neither ate nor drank forgetting all but his great work he kept postponing the painting of two headschrist and judas he had worked painstakingly and with enthusiasm till that point but deferred what he was hardly willing to trust himself to perform he had certain conceptions of these features which he almost feared to execute so tremendous was his purpose he let that part of the work go month after month and having already spent two years upon the picture the monks began to urge him to a finish he was not the man to endure much pressure and the more they urged the more resentful he became finally he began to feel a bitter dislike for the prior the man who annoyed him most one day when the prior was nagging him about the picture wanting to know why he didnt get to work upon it again and when would it be finished leonardo said suavely if you will sit for the head of judas ill be able to finish the picture at once the prior was enraged as leonardo meant he should be but leonardo is said actually to have painted him in as judas afterward he painted in the face of christ with haste and little care simply because he despaired of ever doing the wonderful face that his art soul demanded christ should wear the one bitter moment in leonardos life in all probability was when he came in dire competition with michael angelo when he removed to florence he was required to submit sketches for the town hallthe palazzo vecchioand michael angelo was his rival the choice fell to angelo and after a life of supremacy leonardo could not endure the humiliation with grace added to disappointment someone declared that leonardos powers were waning because he was growing old this was more than he could bear and he left italy for france where the king had invited him to come and spend the remainder of his life francis i had wished to have the picture in the milan monastery taken to france but that was not to be done doubtless the king expected leonardo to do some equally great work after he became the nations guest before leaving italy leonardo had painted his one other greatest picturela gioconda mona lisaand he took that wonderful work with him to france where the king purchased it for 9000 and to this day it hangs in the louvre but leonardo was to do no great work in france for in truth he was growing old his health had failed and although he was still a dandy and court favourite setting the fashion in clothing and in the cut of hair and beard he was no longer the brilliant active leonardo bernard berensen has written of him painting was to leonardo so little of a preoccupation that we must regard it as merely a mode of expression used at moments by a man of universal genius by which berensen means us to understand that leonardo was so brilliant a student and inventor so versatile that art was a mere pastime no let us not join in the reproaches made to leonardo for having painted so little because he had so much more to do than to paint he has left all of us heirs to one or two of the supremest works of art ever created another author writes that in leonardo da vinci every talent was combined in one man leonardo was the third person of the wonderful trinity of florentine painters raphael and michael angelo being the other two he knew so much that he never doubted his own powers but when he died after three years in france he left little behind him and that little he had ever declared to be unfinishedthe mona lisa and the last supper he died in the chteau de cloux at amboise and it is said that sore wept the king when he heard that leonardo was dead in milan near the cathedral there stands a monument to his memory and about it are placed the statues of his pupils to this day he is wonderful among the great men of the world platethe last supper this as we have said is in the former convent of santa maria delle grazie in milan it was the first painted story of this legendary event in which natural and spontaneous action on the part of all the company was presented today the picture is nearly ruined by smoke time and alterations in the place for a great door lintel has been cut into the picture leonardo used the words of the christ verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me as the starting point for this painting it is after the utterance of these words that we see each of the disciples questioning horrified frightened anxious listening angeredall these emotions being expressed by the face or gestures of the hands or pose of the figures it is a most wonderful picture and it seems as if the limit of genius was to be found in it the company is gathered in a halfdark hall the heads outlined against the evening light that comes through the windows at the back we look into a room and seem to behold the greatest tragedy of legendary history treachery and sorrow and consternation brought to jesus of nazareth and his comrades this great picture was painted in oil instead of in distemper the proper kind of mixture for fresco and therefore it was bound to be lost in the course of time besides it has known more than ordinary disaster the troops of napoleon used this room the convent refectory for a stable and that did not do the painting any good the reason we have so complete a knowledge of it however is that leonardos pupils made an endless number of copies of it and thus it has found its way into thousands of homes the following is the order in which leonardo placed the disciples at the table jesus of nazareth in the centre bartholomew the last on the left after him is james andrew peter judaswho holds the money bagand john on the right next to jesus comes thomas the doubting one james the greater philip matthew thaddeus and simon jesus has just declared that one of them shall betray him and each in his own way seems to be asking lord is it i in the south kensington museum in london will be found carefully preserved a description written out fairly in leonardos own hand to guide him in painting the last supper it is most interesting and we shall quote it one in the act of drinking puts down his glass and turns his head to the speaker another twisting his fingers together turns to his companion knitting his eyebrows another opening his hands and turning the palm toward the spectator shrugs his shoulders his mouth expressing the liveliest surprise another whispers in the ear of a companion who turns to listen holding in one hand a knife and in the other a loaf which he has cut in two another turning around with a knife in his hand upsets a glass upon the table and looks another gasps in amazement another leans forward to look at the speaker shading his eyes with his hand another drawing back behind the one who leans forward looks into the space between the wall and the stooping disciple other paintings of leonardos are mona lisa head of medusa adoration of the magi and the madonna della caraffa xliv jean antoine watteau pronounced in french vahttoh english wottoh french genre school 16841721 pupil of gillot and audran watteaus father was a tiler in a flemish townvalenciennes he meant that his son should be a carpenter but that son tramped from valenciennes to paris with the purpose of becoming a great painter he did more he became a school of painting all by himself there is no sadder story among artists than that of this lowly born genius he was not good to look upon being the very opposite of all that he loved having no grace or charm in appearance he had a drooping mouth red and bony hands and a narrow chest with stooping shoulders because of a strange sensitiveness he lived all his life apart from those he would have been happy with for he mistrusted his own ugliness and thought he might be a burden to others such a man has painted the gayest gladdest most delicate and exquisite pictures imaginable he entered paris as a young man without friends without money or connections of any kind and after wandering forlornly about the great city he found employment with a dealer who made hundreds of saints for outoftown churches it is said that for this first employer watteau made dozens and dozens of pictures of st nicholas and when we think of the beautiful figures he was going to make pictures that should delight all the world there seems something tragic in the monotony and commonplaceness of that first work he was forced by poverty to do certainly st nicholas brought one man bread and butter even if he forgot him at christmas time after that hard apprenticeship watteaus condition became slightly better he had been employed near the pont notre dame at three francs a week but now in the studio of a scene painter gillot he did work of coarse effect very different from that exquisite school of art which he was to bring into being after gillots came the studio of claude audran the conservator of the luxembourg and with him watteau did decorative work in reality he had no master learned from nobody grovelled in poverty and at first forced a living from the meanest sources with this in mind it remains a wonder that he should paint as no other ever could scenes of exquisite beauty and grace scenes of high life courtiers and great ladies assembled in lovely landscapes doing elegant and charming things dressed in unrivalled gowns and costumes until watteau went to the luxembourg he had seen absolutely nothing of refined or gracious living he had come from country scenes and in paris had lived among workmen and birdfanciers flower sellers hucksters and the like this is very likely the secret of his peculiar art watteau would have been a wonderful artist under any circumstances no matter what sort of pictures he had painted but circumstances gave his imagination a turn toward the exquisite in colourand composition doubtless when he first looked down from the palace windows of the luxembourg and saw gorgeous women and handsome men languishing and coquetting and revelling in a life of ease and beauty he was transported he must have thought himself in fairyland and the impulse to paint to idealise the loveliness that he saw must have been greater in him than it would have been in one who had lived so long among such scenes that they had become familiar with them after watteau there were artists who tried to do the kind of work he had done but no one ever succeeded watteau clothed all his shepherdesses in fine silken gowns with a plait in the back falling from the shoulders and today we have a fashion known as the watteau backgowns made with this shoulderplait he put filmy laces or softest silks upon his dairy maids as upon his court ladies dressing his figures exquisitely and in the loveliest colours he had suffered from poverty and from miserable sights so when he came to paint pictures he determined to reproduce only the loveliest objects at that time french fashions were very unusual and it was quite the thing for ladies to hold a sort of reception while at their toilet a description of one of these affairs was written by madame de grignon to her daughter nothing can be more delightful than to assist at the toilet of madame la duchesse de bourgoyne and to watch her arrange her hair i was present the other day she rose at half past twelve put on her dressing gown and set to work to eat a mringue she ate the powder and greased her hair the whole formed an excellent breakfast and charming coiffure watteau has caught the spirit of this strange airy artificial incongruous existence his ladies seem to be eating meringues and powdering their hair and living on a diet of the combination one hardly knows which is toilet and which is real life in looking at his paintings he quarreled with audran at the luxembourg and having sold his first picture he went back to his valenciennes home to see his former acquaintances no doubt being a little vain of his performance after that he painted another picture which sold well enough to keep him from poverty for a time and on his return to paris he was warmly greeted by a celebrated and influential artist crozat watteau tried for a prize and though his picture came second it had been seen by the academy committee his greatness was acknowledged and he was immediately admitted to the academy and granted a pension by the crown with which he was able to go to italy the mecca of all artists the world over from italy he went to london but there the fogs and unsuitable climate made his disease much worse and he hurried back to france where he went to live with a friend who was a picture dealer it was then that he painted a sign for this friend gersaint a sign so wonderful that it is reckoned in the history of watteaus paintings soon he grew so sensitive over his illness that he did not wish to remain near his dearest friends but one of them the abb haranger insisted upon looking after his welfare and got lodgings for him at nogent where he could have country air and peace watteau died very soon after going to nogent in july 1721 and he left nine thousand livres to his parents and his paintings to his best friends the abb gersaint monsieur henin and monsieur julienne he is called the first french painter and so he wasthough he was flemish by birth platefte champtre this exquisite picture displays nearly all the characteristics of watteaus painting he was said to paint with honey and gold and his method was certainly remarkable his clear delicate colours were put upon a canvas first daubed with oil and he never cleaned his palette his oilpot was full of dust and dirt and mixed with the washings of his brush one would think that only the most slovenly results could come from such habits of work but the artist made a colour which no one could copy and that was a sort of creamy opalescent white this was original with watteau and most beautiful in this fte champtre which is now in the national gallery at edinburgh he paints an elegant group of ladies and gentlemen indulging in an open air dance of some sort one couple are doing steps facing one another to the music of a set of pipes while the rest flirt and talk decorously round about there is no boisterous rusticity here all is dainty and refined the same characteristics are to be found in watteaus other pictures such as embarkation for the island of cythera the judgment of paris and gay company in a park xlv sir benjamin west american 17381820 pupil of the italian school the beautiful smile of his little niece helped to make this man an artist this is the story benjamin west was born down in pennsylvania at westdale a small village in the township of springfield of quaker parentage the family was poor perhaps but in america at a time when everybody was struggling with a new civilisation it did not seem to be such binding poverty as the same condition in europe would have been benjamin had a married sister whose baby he greatly loved and he gave it devoted attention one day while it was sleeping and the undiscovered artist was sitting beside it he saw it smile and the beauty of the smile inspired him to keep it forever if he could he got paper and pencil and forthwith transferred that angels whisper no child of today can imagine the difficulties a boy must have had in those days in america to get an art education and having learned his art how impossible it was to live by it men were busy making a new country and pictures do not take part in such pioneer work they come later still there were bound to be born artistic geniuses then just as there were men for the plough and men for politics and for war he who happened to be the artist was the quaker boy west he took his first inspiration from the cherokees for it was the indian in all the splendour of his strength and straightness that formed wests ideal of beautiful physique when he first saw the apollo belvedere he exclaimed a young mohawk warrior to the disgust of every one who heard him but he meant to compliment the noblest of forms europeans did not know how magnificent a figure the young mohawk warrior could be but west knew after his indian impetus toward art he went to philadelphia and settled himself in a studio where he painted portraits his sitters went to him out of curiosity as much as anything else but at last a philadelphia gentleman who knew what art meant recognised benjamin wests talent and made some arrangement by which the young man went to italy life began to look beautiful and promising to the pennsylvanian he was in italy for three years and in that home of art the young man who had made the smile of his sisters sleeping baby immortal was given highest honours he was elected a member of all the great art societies in italy and studied with the best artists of the time he began to earn his living we may be sure and then he went to england where in spite of the prejudice there must have been against the colonists he became at once a favourite of george iii a friend of reynolds and of all the english artists of reputeunless perhaps of gainsborough who made friends with none west was appointed historical painter to his majesty george iii and he was chosen to be one of four who should draw plans for a royal academy he was one of the first members of that great organisation and when sir joshua reynolds the first president died west became president remaining in office for twentyeight years about that time came the peace of amiens and west was able to go to paris where he could see the greatest art treasures of europe which had been brought to france from every quarter as a consequence of the war at that time before paris began to return these and when she had just pillaged every great capital of europe artists need take but a single trip to see all the art worth seeing in the whole world after a long service in the academy west quarreled with some of the academicians and sent in his resignation but his fellow artists had too much sense and good feeling to accept it and begged him to reconsider his action he did so and returned to his place as president when west was sixtyfive years old he made a picture christ healing the sick which he meant to give to the quakers in philadelphia who were trying to get funds with which to build a hospital this picture was to be sold for the fund but it was no sooner finished and exhibited in london before being sent to america than it was bought for 3000 guineas for great britain west did not contribute this money to the hospital fund but he made a replica for the quakers and sent that instead of the original west was eightytwo years old when he died and he was buried in st pauls cathedral after a distinguished and honoured life since europe gave him his education and also supported him most of his life we must consider him more english than american his birth on american soil being a mere accident platethe death of wolfe this death scene upon the plains of abraham without the walls of quebec in 1759 must not be taken as a realistic picture of an historic event west drew upon his imagination and upon portraits of the prominent men supposed to have been grouped around the dying general and he has produced a dramatic effect one can imagine it is the two with fingers pointing backward who have just brought the memorable tidings they run they run who run asks wolfe for when he had fallen the issues of the fight were still undecided the french sir they give way everywhere thank god i die in peace replied the english hero at a time when the momentous results of this battle had set the whole of great britain afire with enthusiasm it is easy to understand the popularity of a picture such as this it was sold in 1791 for 28 and now belongs to the duke of westminster there is a replica of it in the queens drawingroom at hampton court another famous historical picture by west is the battle of la hogue index about edmund academia florence academy french rome royal london
