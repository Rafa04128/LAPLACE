of men the story precedes and outlives history there are many instances of the fact that if an insect attract our attention for this reason or that it is given a place in those legends of the people whose last care is truth for example who is there that does not at least by hearsay know the cigale where in the entomological world shall we find a more famous reputation her fame as an impassioned singer careless of the future was the subject of our earliest lessons in repetition in short easily remembered lines of verse we learned how she was destitute when the winter winds arrived and how she went begging for food to the ant her neighbour a poor welcome she received the wouldbe borrowera welcome that has become proverbial and her chief title to celebrity the petty malice of the two short lines vous chantiez jen suis bien aise eh bien dansez maintenant has done more to immortalise the insect than her skill as a musician you sang i am very glad to hear it now you can dance the words lodge in the childish memory never to be forgotten to most englishmento most frenchmen eventhe song of the cigale is unknown for she dwells in the country of the olivetree but we all know of the treatment she received at the hands of the ant on such trifles does fame depend a legend of very dubious value its moral as bad as its natural history a nurses tale whose only merit is its brevity such is the basis of a reputation which will survive the wreck of centuries no less surely than the tale of pussinboots and of little red ridinghood the child is the best guardian of tradition the great conservative custom and tradition become indestructible when confided to the archives of his memory to the child we owe the celebrity of the cigale of whose misfortunes he has babbled during his first lessons in recitation it is he who will preserve for future generations the absurd nonsense of which the body of the fable is constructed the cigale will always be hungry when the cold comes although there were never cigales in winter she will always beg alms in the shape of a few grains of wheat a diet absolutely incompatible with her delicate capillary tongue and in desperation she will hunt for flies and grubs although she never eats whom shall we hold responsible for these strange mistakes la fontaine who in most of his fables charms us with his exquisite fineness of observation has here been illinspired his earlier subjects he knew down to the ground the fox the wolf the cat the stag the crow the rat the ferret and so many others whose actions and manners he describes with a delightful precision of detail these are inhabitants of his own country neighbours fellowparishioners their life private and public is lived under his eyes but the cigale is a stranger to the haunts of jack rabbit la fontaine had never seen nor heard her for him the celebrated songstress was certainly a grasshopper grandville whose pencil rivals the authors pen has fallen into the same error in his illustration to the fable we see the ant dressed like a busy housewife on her threshold beside her full sacks of wheat she disdainfully turns her back upon the wouldbe borrower who holds out her clawpardon her hand with a wide coachmans hat a guitar under her arm and a skirt wrapped about her knees by the gale there stands the second personage of the fable the perfect portrait of a grasshopper grandville knew no more than la fontaine of the true cigale he has beautifully expressed the general confusion but la fontaine in this abbreviated history is only the echo of another fabulist the legend of the cigale and the cold welcome of the ant is as old as selfishness as old as the world the children of athens going to school with their baskets of rushwork stuffed with figs and olives were already repeating the story under their breath as a lesson to be repeated to the teacher in winter they used to say the ants were putting their damp food to dry in the sun there came a starving cigale to beg from them she begged for a few grains the greedy misers replied you sang in the summer now dance in the winter this although somewhat more arid is precisely la fontaines story and is contrary to the facts yet the story comes to us from greece which is like the south of france the home of the olivetree and the cigale was sop really its author as tradition would have it it is doubtful and by no means a matter of importance at all events the author was a greek and a compatriot of the cigale which must have been perfectly familiar to him there is not a single peasant in my village so blind as to be unaware of the total absence of cigales in winter and every tiller of the soil every gardener is familiar with the first phase of the insect the larva which his spade is perpetually discovering when he banks up the olives at the approach of the cold weather and he knows having seen it a thousand times by the edge of the country paths how in summer this larva issues from the earth from a little round well of its own making how it climbs a twig or a stem of grass turns upon its back climbs out of its skin drier now than parchment and becomes the cigale a creature of a fresh grassgreen colour which is rapidly replaced by brown we cannot suppose that the greek peasant was so much less intelligent than the provenal that he can have failed to see what the least observant must have noticed he knew what my rustic neighbours know so well the scribe whoever he may have been who was responsible for the fable was in the best possible circumstances for correct knowledge of the subject whence then arose the errors of his tale less excusably than la fontaine the greek fabulist wrote of the cigale of the books instead of interrogating the living cigale whose cymbals were resounding on every side careless of the real he followed tradition he himself echoed a more ancient narrative he repeated some legend that had reached him from india the venerable mother of civilisations we do not know precisely what story the reedpen of the hindoo may have confided to writing in order to show the perils of a life without foresight but it is probable that the little animal drama was nearer the truth than the conversation between the cigale and the ant india the friend of animals was incapable of such a mistake everything seems to suggest that the principal personage of the original fable was not the cigale of the midi but some other creature an insect if you will whose manners corresponded to the adopted text imported into greece after long centuries during which on the banks of the indus it made the wise reflect and the children laugh the ancient anecdote perhaps as old as the first piece of advice that a father of a family ever gave in respect of economy transmitted more or less faithfully from one memory to another must have suffered alteration in its details as is the fate of all such legends which the passage of time adapts to the circumstance of time and place the greek not finding in his country the insect of which the hindoo spoke introduced the cigale as in paris the modern athens the cigale has been replaced by the grasshopper the mistake was made henceforth indelible entrusted as it is to the memory of childhood error will prevail against the truth that lies before our eyes let us seek to rehabilitate the songstress so calumniated by the fable she is i grant you an importunate neighbour every summer she takes up her station in hundreds before my door attracted thither by the verdure of two great planetrees and there from sunrise to sunset she hammers on my brain with her strident symphony with this deafening concert thought is impossible the mind is in a whirl is seized with vertigo unable to concentrate itself if i have not profited by the early morning hours the day is lost ah creature possessed the plague of my dwelling which i hoped would be so peacefulthe athenians they say used to hang you up in a little cage the better to enjoy your song one were well enough during the drowsiness of digestion but hundreds roaring all at once assaulting the hearing until thought recoilsthis indeed is torture you put forward as excuse your rights as the first occupant before my arrival the two planetrees were yours without reserve it is i who have intruded have thrust myself into their shade i confess it yet muffle your cymbals moderate your arpeggi for the sake of your historian the truth rejects what the fabulist tells us as an absurd invention that there are sometimes dealings between the cigale and the ant is perfectly correct but these dealings are the reverse of those described in the fable they depend not upon the initiative of the former for the cigale never required the help of others in order to make her living on the contrary they are due to the ant the greedy exploiter of others who fills her granaries with every edible she can find at no time does the cigale plead starvation at the doors of the anthills faithfully promising a return of principal and interest the ant on the contrary harassed by drought begs of the songstress begs do i say borrowing and repayment are no part of the manners of this landpirate she exploits the cigale she impudently robs her let us consider this theft a curious point of history as yet unknown in july during the stifling hours of the afternoon when the insect peoples frantic with drought wander hither and thither vainly seeking to quench their thirst at the faded exhausted flowers the cigale makes light of the general aridity with her rostrum a delicate augur she broaches a cask of her inexhaustible store crouching always singing on the twig of a suitable shrub or bush she perforates the firm glossy rind distended by the sap which the sun has matured plunging her proboscis into the bunghole she drinks deliciously motionless and wrapt in meditation abandoned to the charms of syrup and of song let us watch her awhile perhaps we shall witness unlookedfor wretchedness and want for there are many thirsty creatures wandering hither and thither and at last they discover the cigales private well betrayed by the oozing sap upon the brink they gather round it at first with a certain amount of constraint confining themselves to lapping the extravasated liquor i have seen crowding around the honeyed perforation wasps flies earwigs sphinxmoths pompilid rosechafers and above all ants the smallest in order to reach the well slip under the belly of the cigale who kindly raises herself on her claws leaving room for the importunate ones to pass the larger stamping with impatience quickly snatch a mouthful withdraw take a turn on the neighbouring twigs and then return this time more enterprising envy grows keener those who but now were cautious become turbulent and aggressive and would willingly drive from the spring the wellsinker who has caused it to flow in this crowd of brigands the most aggressive are the ants i have seen them nibbling the ends of the cigales claws i have caught them tugging the ends of her wings climbing on her back tickling her antenn one audacious individual so far forgot himself under my eyes as to seize her proboscis endeavouring to extract it from the well thus hustled by these dwarfs and at the end of her patience the giantess finally abandons the well she flies away throwing a jet of liquid excrement over her tormentors as she goes but what cares the ant for this expression of sovereign contempt she is left in possession of the springonly too soon exhausted when the pump is removed that made it flow there is little left but that little is sweet so much to the good she can wait for another drink attained in the same manner as soon as the occasion presents itself illustration during the droughts of summer thirsting insects and notably the ant flock to the drinkingplaces of the cigale as we see reality completely reverses the action described by the fable the shameless beggar who does not hesitate at theft is the ant the industrious worker willingly sharing her goods with the suffering is the cigale yet another detail and the reversal of the fable is further emphasised after five or six weeks of gaiety the songstress falls from the tree exhausted by the fever of life the sun shrivels her body the feet of the passersby crush it a bandit always in search of booty the ant discovers the remains she divides the rich find dissects it and cuts it up into tiny fragments which go to swell her stock of provisions it is not uncommon to see a dying cigale whose wings are still trembling in the dust drawn and quartered by a gang of knackers her body is black with them after this instance of cannibalism the truth of the relations between the two insects is obvious antiquity held the cigale in high esteem the greek branger anacreon devoted an ode to her in which his praise of her is singularly exaggerated thou art almost like unto the gods he says the reasons which he has given for this apotheosis are none of the best they consist in these three privileges greek ggens apaths hanaimosarke born of the earth insensible to pain bloodless we will not reproach the poet for these mistakes they were then generally believed and were perpetuated long afterwards until the exploring eye of scientific observation was directed upon them and in minor poetry whose principal merit lies in rhythm and harmony we must not look at things too closely even in our days the provenal poets who know the cigale as anacreon never did are scarcely more careful of the truth in celebrating the insect which they have taken for their emblem a friend of mine an eager observer and a scrupulous realist does not deserve this reproach he gives me permission to take from his pigeonholes the following provenal poem in which the relations between the cigale and the ant are expounded with all the rigour of science i leave to him the responsibility for his poetic images and his moral reflections blossoms unknown to my naturalists garden but i can swear to the truth of all he says for it corresponds with what i see each summer on the lilactrees of my

teisasvous dounc quand di lambrusco la cigalo a cava la rusco raubas soun bure e pii morto la rousigas so speaks my friend in the expressive provenal idiom rehabilitating the creature so libelled by the fabulist translated with a little necessary freedom the english of it is as follows i fine weather for the cigale god what heat half drunken with her joy she feasts in a hail of fire pays for the harvest meet a golden sea the reaper breasts loins bent throat bare silent he labours long for thirst within his throat has stilled the song a blessed time for thee little cigale thy little cymbals shake and sound shake shake thy stomach till thy mirrors fall man meanwhile swings his scythe around continually back and forth it veers flashing its steel amidst the ruddy ears grassplugged with water for the grinder full a flask is hung upon his hip the stone within its wooden trough is cool free all the day to sip and sip but man is gasping in the fiery sun that makes his very marrow melt and run thou cigale hast a cure for thirst the bark tender and juicy of the bough thy beak a very needle stabs it mark the narrow passage welling now the sugared stream is flowing thee beside who drinkest of the flood the honeyed tide not in peace always nay for thieves arrive neighbours and wives or wanderers vile they saw thee sink the well and ill they thrive thirsting they seek to drink awhile beauty beware the walletsnatchers face humble at first grows insolent apace they seek the merest drop thy leavings take soon discontent their heads they toss they crave for all and all will have they rake their claws thy folded wings across thy back a mountain up and down each goes they seize thee by the beak the horns the toes this way and that they pull impatient thou pst pst a jet of nauseous taste oer the assembly sprinklest leave the bough and fly the rascals thus disgraced who stole thy well and with malicious pleasure now lick their honeyd lips and feed at leisure see these bohemians without labour fed the ant the worst of all the crew fly drone wasp beetle too with horned head all of them sharpers thro and thro idlers the sun drew to thy well apace none more than she was eager for thy place more apt thy face to tickle toe to tread or nose to pinch and then to run under the shade thine ample belly spread or climb thy leg for ladder sun herself audacious on thy wings and go most insolently oer thee to and fro ii now comes a tale that no one should believe in other times the ancients say the winter came and hunger made thee grieve thou didst in secret see one day the ant below the ground her treasure store away the wealthy ant was drying in the sun her corn the dew had wet by night ere storing it again and one by one she filled her sacks as it dried aright thou camest then and tears bedimmed thy sight saying tis very cold the bitter bise blows me this way and that today i die of hunger of your riches please fill me my bag and ill repay when summer and its melons come this way lend me a little corn go to go to think you the ant will lend an ear you are deceived great sacks but nought for you be off and scrape some barrel clear you sing of summer starve for winters here tis thus the ancient fable sings to teach us all the prudence ripe of farthingsnatchers glad to knot the string that tie their purses may the gripe of colic twist the guts of all such tripe he angers me this fableteller does saying in winter thou dost seek flies grubs cornthou dost never eat like us corn couldst thou eat it with thy beak thou hast thy fountain with its honeyd reek to thee what matters winter underground slumber thy children sheltered thou the sleep that knows no waking sleepest sound thy body fallen from the bough crumbles the questing ant has found thee now the wicked ant of thy poor withered hide a banquet makes in little bits she cuts thee up and empties thine inside and stores thee where in wealth she sits choice diet when the winter numbs the wits iii here is the tale related duly and little resembling the fable truly hoarders of farthings i know deuce take it it isnt the story as you would make it crookfingers bigbellies what do you say who govern the world with the cashboxhey you have spread the story with shrug and smirk that the artist neer does a stroke of work and so let him suffer the imbecile be you silent tis you i think when the cigale pierces the vine to drink drive her away her drink to steal and when she is deadyou make your meal chapter ii the cigale leaves its burrow the first cigales appear about the summer solstice along the beaten paths calcined by the sun hardened by the passage of frequent feet we see little circular orifices almost large enough to admit the thumb these are the holes by which the larv of the cigale have come up from the depths to undergo metamorphosis we see them more or less everywhere except in fields where the soil has been disturbed by ploughing their usual position is in the driest and hottest situations especially by the sides of roads or the borders of footpaths powerfully equipped for the purpose able at need to pierce the turf or sundried clay the larva upon leaving the earth seems to prefer the hardest spots a garden alley converted into a little arabia petra by reflection from a wall facing the south abounds in such holes during the last days of june i have made an examination of these recently abandoned pits the soil is so compact that i needed a pick to tackle it the orifices are round and close upon an inch in diameter there is absolutely no debris round them no earth thrown up from within this is always the case the holes of the cigales are never surrounded by dumpingheaps as are the burrows of the geotrupes another notable excavator the way in which the work is done is responsible for this difference the dungbeetle works from without inwards she begins to dig at the mouth of the burrow and afterwards reascends and accumulates the excavated material on the surface the larva of the cigale on the contrary works outward from within upward from below it opens the door of exit at the last moment so that it is not free for the discharge of excavated material until the work is done the first enters and raises a little rubbishheap at the threshold of her burrow the second emerges and cannot while working pile up its rubbish on a threshold which as yet has no existence the burrow of the cigale descends about fifteen inches it is cylindrical slightly twisted according to the exigencies of the soil and always approaches the vertical or the direction of the shortest passage it is perfectly free along its entire length we shall search in vain for the rubbish which such an excavation must apparently produce we shall find nothing of the sort the burrow terminates in a culdesac in a fairly roomy chamber with unbroken walls which shows not the least vestige of communication with any other burrow or prolongation of the shaft taking its length and diameter into account we find the excavation has a total volume of about twelve cubic inches what becomes of the earth which is removed sunk in a very dry crumbling soil we should expect the shaft and the chamber at the bottom to have soft powdery walls subject to petty landslips if no work were done but that of excavation on the contrary the walls are neatly daubed plastered with a sort of claylike mortar they are not precisely smooth indeed they are distinctly rough but their irregularities are covered with a layer of plaster and the crumbling material soaked in some glutinous liquid and dried is held firmly in place the larva can climb up and down ascend nearly to the surface and go down into its chamber of refuge without bringing down with his claws the continual falls of material which would block the burrow make ascent a matter of difficulty and retreat impossible the miner shores up his galleries with uprights and crosstimbers the builder of underground railways supports the sides and roofs of his tunnels with a lining of brick or masonry or segments of iron tube the larva of the cigale no less prudent an engineer plasters the walls of its burrow with cement so that the passage is always free and ready for use if i surprise the creature just as it is emerging from the soil in order to gain a neighbouring bough and there undergo transformation i see it immediately make a prudent retreat descending to the bottom of its burrow without the slightest difficultya proof that even when about to be abandoned for ever the refuge is not encumbered with rubbish the ascending shaft is not a hurried piece of work scamped by a creature impatient to reach the sunlight it is a true dwelling in which the larva may make a long stay the plastered walls betray as much such precautions would be useless in the case of a simple exit abandoned as soon as made we cannot doubt that the burrow is a kind of meteorological observatory and that its inhabitant takes note of the weather without buried underground at a depth of twelve or fifteen inches the larva when ripe for escape could hardly judge whether the meteorological conditions were favourable the subterranean climate varies too little changes too slowly and would not afford it the precise information required for the most important action of its lifethe escape into the sunshine at the time of metamorphosis patiently for weeks perhaps for months it digs clears and strengthens a vertical shaft leaving only a layer of earth a fingers breadth in thickness to isolate it from the outer world at the bottom it prepares a carefully built recess this is its refuge its place of waiting where it reposes in peace if its observations decide it to postpone its final departure at the least sign of fine weather it climbs to the top of its burrow sounds the outer world through the thin layer of earth which covers the shaft and informs itself of the temperature and humidity of the outer air if things are not going wellif there are threats of a flood or the dreaded biseevents of mortal gravity when the delicate insect issues from its cerementsthe prudent creature redescends to the bottom of its burrow for a longer wait if on the contrary the state of the atmosphere is favourable the roof is broken through by a few strokes of its claws and the larva emerges from its tunnel everything seems to prove that the burrow of the cigale is a waitingroom a meteorological station in which the larva makes a prolonged stay sometimes hoisting itself to the neighbourhood of the surface in order to ascertain the external climate sometimes retiring to the depths the better to shelter itself this explains the chamber at the base of the shaft and the necessity of a cement to hold the walls together for otherwise the creatures continual comings and goings would result in a landslip a matter less easy of explanation is the complete disappearance of the material which originally filled the excavated space where are the twelve cubic inches of earth that represent the average volume of the original contents of the shaft there is not a trace of this material outside nor inside either and how in a soil as dry as a cinder is the plaster made with which the walls are covered larv which burrow in wood such as those of capricornis and buprestes will apparently answer our first question they make their way through the substance of a treetrunk boring their galleries by the simple method of eating the material in front of them detached by their mandibles fragment by fragment the material is digested it passes from end to end through the body of the pioneer yields during its passage its meagre nutritive principles and accumulates behind it obstructing the passage by which the larva will never return the work of extreme division effected partly by the mandibles and partly by the stomach makes the digested material more compact than the intact wood from which it follows that there is always a little free space at the head of the gallery in which the caterpillar works and lives it is not of any great length but just suffices for the movements of the prisoner must not the larva of the cigale bore its passage in some such fashion i do not mean that the results of excavation pass through its bodyfor earth even the softest mould could form no possible part of its diet but is not the material detached simply thrust back behind the excavator as the work progresses the cigale passes four years under ground this long life is not spent of course at the bottom of the well i have just described that is merely a restingplace preparatory to its appearance on the face of the earth the larva comes from elsewhere doubtless from a considerable distance it is a vagabond roaming from one root to another and implanting its rostrum when it moves either to flee from the upper layers of the soil which in winter become too cold or to install itself upon a more juicy root it makes a road by rejecting behind it the material broken up by the teeth of its picks that this is its method is incontestable as with the larv of capricornis and buprestes it is enough for the traveller to have around it the small amount of free space necessitated by its movements moist soft and easily compressible soil is to the larva of the cigale what digested woodpulp is to the others it is compressed without difficulty and so leaves a vacant space the difficulty is that sometimes the burrow of exit from the waitingplace is driven through a very arid soil which is extremely refractory to compression so long as it retains its aridity that the larva when commencing the excavation of its burrow has already thrust part of the detached material into a previously made gallery now filled up and disappeared is probable enough although nothing in the actual condition of things goes to support the theory but if we consider the capacity of the shaft and the extreme difficulty of making room for such a volume of debris we feel dubious once more for to hide such a quantity of earth a considerable empty space would be necessary which could only be obtained by the disposal of more debris thus we are caught in a vicious circle the mere packing of the powdered earth rejected behind the excavator would not account for so large a void the cigale must have a special method of disposing of the waste earth let us see if we can discover the secret let us examine a larva at the moment of emerging from the soil it is almost always more or less smeared with mud sometimes dried sometimes moist the implements of excavation the claws of the forefeet have their points covered by little globules of mortar the others bear leggings of mud the back is spotted with clay one is reminded of a scavenger who has been scooping up mud all day this condition is the more striking in that the insect comes from an absolutely dry soil we should expect to see it dusty we find it muddy one more step and the problem of the well is solved i exhume a larva which is working at its gallery of exit chance postpones this piece of luck which i cannot expect to achieve at once since nothing on the surface guides my search but at last i am rewarded and the larva is just beginning its excavation an inch of tunnel free of all waste or rubbish and at the bottom the chamber the place of rest so far has the work proceeded and the workerin what condition is it let us see the larva is much paler in colour than those which i have caught as they emerged the large eyes in particular are whitish cloudy blurred and apparently blind what would be the use of sight underground the eyes of the larv leaving their burrows are black and shining and evidently capable of sight when it issues into the sunlight the future cigale must find often at some distance from its burrow a suitable twig from which to hang during its metamorphosis so that sight is obviously of the greatest utility the maturity of the eyes attained during the time of preparation before deliverance proves that the larva far from boring its tunnel in haste has spent a long time labouring at it what else do we notice the blind pale larva is far more voluminous than in the mature state it is swollen with liquid as though it had dropsy taken in the fingers a limpid serum oozes from the hinder part of the body which moistens the whole surface is this fluid evacuated by the intestine a product of urinary secretionsimply the contents of a stomach nourished entirely upon sap i will not attempt to decide but for convenience will content myself with calling it urine well this fountain of urine is the key to the enigma as it digs and advances the larva waters the powdery debris and converts it into a paste which is immediately applied to the walls by the pressure of the abdomen aridity is followed by plasticity the mud thus obtained penetrates the interstices of the rough soil the more liquid portion enters the substance of the soil by infiltration the remainder becomes tightly packed and fills up the inequalities of the walls thus the insect obtains an empty tunnel with no loose waste as all the loosened soil is utilised on the spot converted into a mortar which is more compact and homogeneous than the soil through which the shaft is driven thus the larva works in the midst of a coating of mud which is the cause of its dirtiness so astonishing when we see it issue from an excessively dry soil the perfect insect although henceforth liberated from the work of a sapper and miner does not entirely abandon the use of urine as a weapon employing it as a means of defence too closely observed it throws a jet of liquid upon the importunate enemy and flies away in both its forms the cigale in spite of its dry temperament is a famous irrigator dropsical as it is the larva cannot contain sufficient liquid to moisten and convert into easily compressible mud the long column of earth which must be removed from the burrow the reservoir becomes exhausted and the provision must be renewed where and how i think i can answer the question the few burrows uncovered along their entirety with the meticulous care such a task demands have revealed at the bottom encrusted in the wall of the terminal chamber a living root sometimes of the thickness of a pencil sometimes no bigger than a straw the visible portion of this root is only a fraction of an inch in length the rest is hidden by the surrounding earth is the presence of this source of sap fortuitous or is it the result of deliberate choice on the part of the larva i incline towards the second alternative so repeatedly was the presence of a root verified at least when my search was skilfully conducted yes the cigale digging its chamber the nucleus of the future shaft seeks out the immediate neighbourhood of a small living root it lays bare a certain portion which forms part of the wall without projecting this living spot in the wall is the fountain where the supply of moisture is renewed when its reservoir is exhausted by the conversion of dry dust into mud the miner descends to its chamber thrusts its proboscis into the root and drinks deep from the vat built into the wall its organs well filled it reascends it resumes work damping the hard soil the better to remove it with its talons reducing the debris to mud in order to pack it tightly around it and obtain a free passage in this manner the shaft is driven upwards logic and the facts of the case in the absence of direct observation justify the assertion if the root were to fail and the reservoir of the intestine were exhausted what would happen the following experiment will inform us a larva is caught as it leaves the earth i place it at the bottom of a testtube and cover it with a column of dry earth which is rather lightly packed this column is about six inches in height the larva has just left an excavation three times as deep made in soil of the same kind but offering a far greater resistance buried under this short column of powdery earth will it be able to gain the surface if its strength hold out the issue should be certain having but lately made its way through the hard earth this obstacle should be easily removed but i am not so sure in removing the stopper which divided it from the outside world the larva has expended its final store of liquid the cistern is dry and in default of a living root there is no means of replenishing it my suspicions are well founded for three days the prisoner struggles desperately but cannot ascend by so much as an inch it is impossible to fix the material removed in the absence of moisture as soon as it is thrust aside it slips back again the labour has no visible result it is a labour of sisyphus always to be commenced anew on the fourth day the creature succumbs with the intestines full the result is very different i make the same experiment with an insect which is only beginning its work of liberation it is swollen with fluid which oozes from it and moistens the whole body its task is easy the overlying earth offers little resistance a small quantity of liquid from the intestines converts it into mud forms a sticky paste which can be thrust aside with the assurance that it will remain where it is placed the shaft is gradually opened very unevenly to be sure and it is almost choked up behind the insect as it climbs upwards it seems as though the creature recognises the impossibility of renewing its store of liquid and so economises the little it possesses using only just so much as is necessary in order to escape as quickly as possible from surroundings which are strange to its inherited instincts this parsimony is so well judged that the insect gains the surface at the end of twelve days the gate of issue is opened and left gaping like a hole made with an augur for some little time the larva wanders about the neighbourhood of its burrow seeking an eyrie on some lowgrowing bush or tuft of thyme on a stem of grass or grain or the twig of a shrub once found it climbs and firmly clasps its support the head upwards while the talons of the fore feet close with an unyielding grip the other claws if the direction of the twig is convenient assist in supporting it otherwise the claws of the two fore legs will suffice there follows a moment of repose while the supporting limbs stiffen in an unbreakable hold then the thorax splits along the back and through the fissure the insect slowly emerges the whole process lasts perhaps half an hour there is the adult insect freed of its mask and how different from what it was but how the wings are heavy moist transparent with nervures of a tender green the thorax is barely clouded with brown all the rest of the body is a pale green whitish in places heat and a prolonged airbath are necessary to harden and colour the fragile creature some two hours pass without any perceptible change hanging to its deserted shell by the two fore limbs the cigale sways to the least breath of air still feeble and still green finally the brown colour appears and rapidly covers the whole body the change of colour is completed in half an hour fastening upon its chosen twig at nine oclock in the morning the cigale flies away under my eyes at halfpast twelve the empty shell remains intact except for the fissure in the back clasping the twig so firmly that the winds of autumn do not always succeed in detaching it for some months yet and even during the winter you will often find these forsaken skins hanging from the twigs in the precise attitude assumed by the larva at the moment of metamorphosis they are of a horny texture not unlike dry parchment and do not readily decay i could gather some wonderful information regarding the cigale were i to listen to all that my neighbours the peasants tell me i will give one instance of rustic natural history illustration the cigale and the empty pupaskin are you afflicted with any kidney trouble or are you swollen with dropsy or have you need of some powerful diuretic the village pharmacopoeia is unanimous in recommending the cigale as a sovereign remedy the insects in the adult form are collected in summer they are strung into necklaces which are dried in the sun and carefully preserved in some cupboard or drawer a good housewife would consider it imprudent to allow july to pass without threading a few of these insects do you suffer from any nephritic irritation or from stricture drink an infusion of cigales nothing they say is more effectual i must take this opportunity of thanking the good soul who once upon a time so i was afterwards informed made me drink such a concoction unawares for the cure of some such trouble but i still remain incredulous i have been greatly struck by the fact that the ancient physician of anazarbus used to recommend the same remedy dioscorides tells us cicad quae inassatae manduntur vesicae doloribus prosunt since the distant days of this patriarch of materia medica the provenal peasant has retained his faith in the remedy revealed to him by the greeks who came from phoca with the olive the fig and the vine only one thing is changed dioscorides advises us to eat the cigales roasted but now they are boiled and the decoction is administered as medicine the explanation which is given of the diuretic properties of the insect is a marvel of ingenuousness the cigale as every one knows who has tried to catch it throws a jet of liquid excrement in ones face as it flies away it therefore endows us with its faculties of evacuation thus dioscorides and his contemporaries must have reasoned so reasons the peasant of provence today what would you say worthy neighbours if you knew of the virtues of the larva which is able to mix sufficient mortar with its urine to build a meteorological station and a shaft connecting with the outer world your powers should equal those of rabelais gargantua who seated upon the towers of notre dame drowned so many thousands of the inquisitive parisians chapter iii the song of the cigale where i live i can capture five species of cigale the two principal species being the common cigale and the variety which lives on the flowering ash both of these are widely distributed and are the only species known to the country folk the larger of the two is the common cigale let me briefly describe the mechanism with which it produces its familiar note on the under side of the body of the male immediately behind the posterior limbs are two wide semicircular plates which slightly overlap one another the right hand lying over the left hand plate these are the shutters the lids the dampers of the musicalbox let us remove them to the right and left lie two spacious cavities which are known in provenal as the chapels li capello together they form the church la gliso their forward limit is formed by a creamy yellow membrane soft and thin the hinder limit by a dry membrane coloured like a soap bubble and known in provenal as the mirror mirau the church the mirrors and the dampers are commonly regarded as the organs which produce the cry of the cigale of a singer out of breath one says that he has broken his mirrors a li mirau creba the same phrase is used of a poet without inspiration acoustics give the lie to the popular belief you may break the mirrors remove the covers with a snip of the scissors and tear the yellow anterior membrane but these mutilations do not silence the song of the cigale they merely change its quality and weaken it the chapels are resonators they do not produce the sound but merely reinforce it by the vibration of their anterior and posterior membranes while the sound is modified by the dampers as they are opened more or less widely the actual source of the sound is elsewhere and is somewhat difficult for a novice to find on the outer wall of either chapel at the ridge formed by the junction of back and belly is a tiny aperture with a horny circumference masked by the overlapping damper we will call this the window this opening gives access to a cavity or soundchamber deeper than the chapels but of much smaller capacity immediately behind the attachment of the posterior wings is a slight protuberance almost eggshaped which is distinguishable on account of its dull black colour from the neighbouring integuments which are covered with a silvery down this protuberance is the outer wall of the soundchamber let us cut it boldly away we shall then lay bare the mechanism which produces the sound the cymbal this is a small dry white membrane oval in shape convex on the outer side and crossed along its larger diameter by a bundle of three or four brown nervures which give it elasticity its entire circumference is rigidly fixed let us suppose that this convex scale is pulled out of shape from the interior so that it is slightly flattened and as quickly released it will immediately regain its original convexity owing to the elasticity of the nervures from this oscillation a ticking sound will result twenty years ago all paris was buying a silly toy called i think the cricket or cricri it was a short slip of steel fixed by one end to a metallic base pressed out of shape by the thumb and released it yielded a very distressing tinkling click nothing else was needed to take the popular mind by storm the cricket had its day of glory oblivion has executed justice upon it so effectually that i fear i shall not be understood when i recall this celebrated device the membranous cymbal and the steel cricket are analogous instruments both produce a sound by reason of the rapid deformation and recovery of an elastic substancein one case a convex membrane in the other a slip of steel the cricket was bent out of shape by the thumb how is the convexity of the cymbals altered let us return to the church and break down the yellow curtain which closes the front of each chapel two thick muscular pillars are visible of a pale orange colour they join at an angle forming a v of which the point lies on the median line of the insect against the lower face of the thorax each of these pillars of flesh terminates suddenly at its upper extremity as though cut short and from the truncated portion rises a short slender tendon which is attached laterally to the corresponding cymbal there is the whole mechanism no less simple than that of the steel cricket the two muscular columns contract and relax shorten and lengthen by means of its terminal thread each sounds its cymbal by depressing it and immediately releasing it when its own elasticity makes it spring back into shape these two vibrating scales are the source of the cigales cry do you wish to convince yourself of the efficiency of this mechanism take a cigale but newly dead and make it sing nothing is simpler seize one of these muscular columns with the forceps and pull it in a series of careful jerks the extinct cricri comes to life again at each jerk there is a clash of the cymbal the sound is feeble to be sure deprived of the amplitude which the living performer is able to give it by means of his resonating chambers none the less the fundamental element of the song is produced by this anatomists trick would you on the other hand silence a living cigalethat obstinate melomaniac who seized in the fingers deplores his misfortune as loquaciously as ever he sang the joys of freedom in his tree it is useless to violate his chapels to break his mirrors the atrocious mutilation would not quiet him but introduce a needle by the lateral aperture which we have named the window and prick the cymbal at the bottom of the soundbox a little touch and the perforated cymbal is silent a similar operation on the other side of the insect and the insect is dumb though otherwise as vigorous as before and without any perceptible wound any one not in the secret would be amazed at the result of my pinprick when the destruction of the mirrors and the other dependencies of the church do not cause silence a tiny perforation of no importance to the insect is more effectual than evisceration the dampers which are rigid and solidly built are motionless it is the abdomen itself which by rising and falling opens or closes the doors of the church when the abdomen is lowered the dampers exactly cover the chapels as well as the windows of the soundboxes the sound is then muted muffled diminished when the abdomen rises the chapels are open the windows unobstructed and the sound acquires its full volume the rapid oscillations of the abdomen synchronising with the contractions of the motor muscles of the cymbals determine the changing volume of the sound which seems to be caused by rapidly repeated strokes of a fiddlestick if the weather is calm and hot towards midday the song of the cigale is divided into strophes of several seconds duration which are separated by brief intervals of silence the strophe begins suddenly in a rapid crescendo the abdomen oscillating with increasing rapidity it acquires its maximum volume it remains for a few seconds at the same degree of intensity then becomes weaker by degrees and degenerates into a shake which decreases as the abdomen returns to rest with the last pulsations of the belly comes silence the length of the silent interval varies according to the state of the atmosphere then of a sudden begins a new strophe a monotonous repetition of the first and so on indefinitely it often happens especially during the hours of the sultry afternoons that the insect intoxicated with sunlight shortens and even suppresses the intervals of silence the song is then continuous but always with an alternation of crescendo and diminuendo the first notes are heard about seven or eight oclock in the morning and the orchestra ceases only when the twilight fails about eight oclock at night the concert lasts a whole round of the clock but if the sky is grey and the wind chilly the cigale is silent the second species only half the size of the common cigale is known in provence as the cacan the name being a fairly exact imitation of the sound emitted by the insect this is the cigale of the flowering ash far more alert and far more suspicious than the common species its harsh loud song consists of a series of criescan can can canwith no intervals of silence subdividing the poem into stanzas thanks to its monotony and its harsh shrillness it is a most odious sound especially when the orchestra consists of hundreds of performers as is often the case in my two planetrees during the dogdays it is as though a heap of dry walnuts were being shaken up in a bag until the shells broke this painful concert which is a real torment offers only one compensation the cigale of the flowering ash does not begin his song so early as the common cigale and does not sing so late in the evening although constructed on the same fundamental principles the vocal organs exhibit a number of peculiarities which give the song its special character the soundbox is lacking which suppresses the entrance to it or the window the cymbal is uncovered and is visible just behind the attachment of the hinder wing it is as before a dry white scale convex on the outside and crossed by a bundle of fine reddishbrown nervures illustration 1 the adult cigale from below 2 the adult cigale from below 3 the cigale of the flowering ash male and female from the forward side of the first segment of the abdomen project two short wide tongueshaped projections the free extremities of which rest on the cymbals these tongues may be compared to the blade of a watchmans rattle only instead of engaging with the teeth of a rotating wheel they touch the nervures of the vibrating cymbal from this fact i imagine results the harsh grating quality of the cry it is hardly possible to verify the fact by holding the insect in the fingers the terrified cacan does not go on singing his usual song the dampers do not overlap on the contrary they are separated by a fairly wide interval with the rigid tongues appendages of the abdomen they half shelter the cymbals half of which is completely bare under the pressure of the finger the abdomen opens a little at its articulation with the thorax but the insect is motionless when it sings there is nothing of the rapid vibrations of the belly which modulate the song of the common cigale the chapels are very small almost negligible as resonators there are mirrors as in the common cigale but they are very small scarcely a twentyfifth of an inch in diameter in short the resonating mechanism so highly developed in the common cigale is here extremely rudimentary how then is the feeble vibration of the cymbals reenforced until it becomes intolerable this species of cigale is a ventriloquist if we examine the abdomen by transmitted light we shall see that the anterior twothirds of the abdomen are translucent with a snip of the scissors we will cut off the posterior third to which are relegated reduced to the strictly indispensable the organs necessary to the propagation of the species and the preservation of the individual the rest of the abdomen presents a spacious cavity and consists simply of the integuments of the walls except on the dorsal side which is lined with a thin muscular layer and supports a fine digestive canal almost a thread this large cavity equal to nearly half the total volume of the insect is thus almost absolutely empty at the back are seen the two motor muscles of the cymbals two muscular columns arranged like the limbs of a v to right and left of the point of this v shine the tiny mirrors and between the two branches of muscle the empty cavity is prolonged into the depths of the thorax this empty abdomen with its thoracic annex forms an enormous resonator such as no other performer in our countryside can boast of if i close with my finger the orifice of the truncated abdomen the sound becomes flatter in conformity with the laws affecting musical resonators if i fit into the aperture of the open body a tube or trumpet of paper the sound grows louder as well as deeper with a paper cone corresponding to the pitch of the note with its large end held in the mouth of a testtube acting as a resonator we have no longer the cry of the cigale but almost the bellowing of a bull my little children coming up to me by chance at the moment of this acoustic experiment fled in terror the grating quality of the sound appears to be due to the little tongues which press on the nervures of the vibrating cymbals the cause of its intensity is of course the ample resonator in the abdomen we must admit that one must truly have a real passion for song before one would empty ones chest and stomach in order to make room for a musicalbox the necessary vital organs are extremely small confined to a mere corner of the body in order to increase the amplitude of the resonating cavity song comes first of all other matters take the second rank it is lucky that the cacan does not follow the laws of evolution if more enthusiastic in each generation it could acquire in the course of progress a ventral resonator comparable to my paper trumpets the south of france would sooner or later become uninhabitable and the cacan would have provence to itself after the details already given concerning the common cigale it is hardly needful to tell you how the insupportable cacan can be reduced to silence the cymbals are plainly visible on the exterior pierce them with the point of a needle and immediately you have perfect silence if only there were in my planetrees among the insects which carry gimlets some friends of silence like myself who would devote themselves to such a task but no a note would be lacking in the majestic symphony of harvesttide we are now familiar with the structure of the musical organ of the cigale now the question arises what is the object of these musical orgies the reply seems obvious they are the call of the males inviting their mates they constitute a lovers cantata i am going to consider this reply which is certainly a very natural one for thirty years the common cigale and his unmusical friend the cacan have thrust their society upon me for two months every summer i have them under my eyes and their voice in my ears if i do not listen to them very willingly i observe them with considerable zeal i see them ranged in rows on the smooth rind of the planetrees all with their heads uppermost the two sexes mingled and only a few inches apart the proboscis thrust into the bark they drink motionless as the sun moves and with it the shadow they also move round the branch with slow lateral steps so as to keep upon that side which is most brilliantly illuminated most fiercely heated whether the proboscis is at work or not the song is never interrupted now are we to take their interminable chant for a passionate lovesong i hesitate in this gathering the two sexes are side by side one does not spend months in calling a person who is at ones elbow moreover i have never seen a female rush into the midst of even the most deafening orchestra sight is a sufficient prelude to marriage for their sight is excellent there is no need for the lover to make an everlasting declaration for his mistress is his nextdoor neighbour is the song a means of charming of touching the hard of heart i doubt it i observe no sign of satisfaction in the females i have never seen them tremble or sway upon their feet though their lovers have clashed their cymbals with the most deafening vigour my neighbours the peasants say that at harvesttime the cigale sings to them sego sego sego reap reap reap to encourage them in their work harvesters of ideas and of ears of grain we follow the same calling the latter produce food for the stomach the former food for the mind thus i understand their explanation and welcome it as an example of gracious simplicity science asks for a better explanation but finds in the insect a world which is closed to us there is no possibility of foreseeing or even of suggesting the impression produced by this clashing of cymbals upon those who inspire it the most i can say is that their impassive exterior seems to denote a complete indifference i do not insist that this is so the intimate feelings of the insect are an insoluble mystery another reason for doubt is this all creatures affected by song have acute hearing and this sense of hearing a vigilant sentinel should give warning of danger at the slightest sound the birds have an exquisite delicacy of hearing if a leaf stirs among the branches if two passersby exchange a word they are suddenly silent anxious and on their guard but the cigale is far from sharing in such emotions it has excellent sight its great faceted eyes inform it of all that happens to right and left its three stemmata like little ruby telescopes explore the sky above its head if it sees us coming it is silent at once and flies away but let us get behind the branch on which it is singing let us manoeuvre so as to avoid the five centres of vision and then let us speak whistle clap the hands beat two stones together for far less a bird which could not see you would stop its song and fly away terrified the cigale imperturbably continues to sing as if nothing had occurred of my experiences of this kind i will mention only one the most remarkable of many i borrowed the municipal artillery that is the iron boxes which are charged with gunpowder on the day of the patron saint the artilleryman was delighted to load them for the benefit of the cigales and to fire them off for me before my house there were two of these boxes stuffed full of powder as though for the most solemn rejoicing never was politician making his electoral progress favoured with a bigger charge to prevent damage to my windows the sashes were all left open the two engines of detonation were placed at the foot of the planetrees before my door no precautions being taken to mask them the cigales singing in the branches above could not see what was happening below there were six of us spectators and auditors we waited for a moment of relative quiet the number of singers was counted by each of us as well as the volume and rhythm of the song we stood ready our ears attentive to the aerial orchestra the box exploded with a clap of thunder no disturbance ensued above the number of performers was the same the rhythm the same the volume the same the six witnesses were unanimous the loud explosion had not modified the song of the cigales in the least the second box gave an identical result what are we to conclude from this persistence of the orchestra its lack of surprise or alarm at the firing of a charge shall we conclude that the cigale is deaf i am not going to venture so far as that but if any one bolder than myself were to make the assertion i really do not know what reasons i could invoke to disprove it i should at least be forced to admit that it is very hard of hearing and that we may well apply to it the homely and familiar phrase to shout like a deaf man when the bluewinged cricket basking on the pebbles of some country footpath grows deliciously intoxicated with the heat of the sun and rubs its great posterior thighs against the roughened edge of its wingcovers when the green treefrog swells its throat in the foliage of the bushes distending it to form a resonant cavity when the rain is imminent is it calling to its absent mate by no means the efforts of the former produce a scarcely perceptible stridulation the palpitating throat of the latter is as ineffectual and the desired one does not come does the insect really require to emit these resounding effusions these vociferous avowals in order to declare its passion consult the immense majority whom the conjunction of the sexes leaves silent in the violin of the grasshopper the bagpipe of the treefrog and the cymbals of the cacan i see only their peculiar means of expressing the joy of living the universal joy which every species of animal expresses after its kind if you were to tell me that the cigales play on their noisy instruments careless of the sound produced and merely for the pleasure of feeling themselves alive just as we rub our hands in a moment of satisfaction i should not be particularly shocked that there is a secondary object in their conceit in which the silent sex is interested is very possible and very natural but it is not as yet proven1 chapter iv the cigale the eggs and their hatching the cigale confides its eggs to dry slender twigs all the branches examined by raumur which bore such eggs were branches of the mulberry a proof that the person entrusted with the search for these eggs in the neighbourhood of avignon did not bring much variety to his quest i find these eggs not only on the mulberrytree but on the peach the cherry the willow the japanese privet and other trees but these are exceptions what the cigale really prefers is a slender twig of a thickness varying from that of a straw to that of a pencil it should have a thin woody layer and plenty of pith if these conditions are fulfilled the species matters little i should pass in review all the semiligneous plants of the country were i to catalogue the various supports which are utilised by the gravid female its chosen twig never lies along the ground it is always in a more or less vertical position it is usually growing in its natural position but is sometimes detached in the latter case it will by chance have fallen so that it retains its upright position the insect prefers a long smooth regular twig which can receive the whole of its eggs the best batches of eggs which i have found have been laid upon twigs of the spartium junceum which are like straws stuffed with pith and especially on the upper twigs of the asphodelus cerasiferus which rises nearly a yard from the ground before ramifying it is essential that the support no matter what its nature should be dead and perfectly dry the first operation performed by the cigale consists in making a series of slight lacerations such as one might make with the point of a pin which if plunged obliquely downwards into the twig would tear the woody fibres and would compress them so as to form a slight protuberance if the twig is irregular in shape or if several cigales have been working successively at the same point the distribution of the punctures is confused the eye wanders incapable of recognising the order of their succession or the work of the individual one characteristic is always present namely the oblique direction of the woody fragment which is raised by the perforation showing that the cigale always works in an upright position and plunges its rostrum downwards in the direction of the twig if the twig is regular smooth and conveniently long the perforations are almost equidistant and lie very nearly in a straight line their number varies it is small when the mother disturbed in her operations has flown away to continue her work elsewhere but they number thirty or forty more or less when they contain the whole of her eggs each one of the perforations is the entrance to an oblique tunnel which is bored in the medullary sheath of the twig the aperture is not closed except by the bunch of woody fibres which parted at the moment when the eggs are laid recover themselves when the double saw of the oviduct is removed sometimes but by no means always you may see between the fibres a tiny glistening patch like a touch of dried white of egg this is only an insignificant trace of some albuminous secretion accompanying the egg or facilitating the work of the double saw of the oviduct immediately below the aperture of the perforation is the egg chamber a short tunnelshaped cavity which occupies almost the whole distance between one opening and that lying below it sometimes the separating partition is lacking and the various chambers run into one another so that the eggs although introduced by the various apertures are arranged in an uninterrupted row this arrangement however is not the most usual the contents of the chambers vary greatly i find in each from six to fifteen eggs the average is ten the total number of chambers varying from thirty to forty it follows that the cigale lays from three to four hundred eggs raumur arrived at the same figures from an examination of the ovaries this is truly a fine family capable by sheer force of numbers of surviving the most serious dangers i do not see that the adult cigale is exposed to greater dangers than any other insect its eye is vigilant its departure sudden and its flight rapid and it inhabits heights at which the prowling brigands of the turf are not to be feared the sparrow it is true will greedily devour it from time to time he will deliberately and meditatively descend upon the planetrees from the neighbouring roof and snatch up the singer who squeaks despairingly a few blows of the beak and the cigale is cut into quarters delicious morsels for the nestlings but how often does the bird return without his prey the cigale foreseeing his attack empties its intestine in the eyes of its assailant and flies away but the cigale has a far more terrible enemy than the sparrow this is the green grasshopper it is late and the cigales are silent drowsy with light and heat they have exhausted themselves in producing their symphonies all day long night has come and with it repose but a repose frequently troubled in the thick foliage of the planetrees there is a sudden sound like a cry of anguish short and strident it is the despairing lamentation of the cigale surprised in the silence by the grasshopper that ardent hunter of the night which leaps upon the cigale seizes it by the flank tears it open and devours the contents of the stomach after the orgy of music comes night and assassination i obtained an insight into this tragedy in the following manner i was walking up and down before my door at daybreak when something fell from the neighbouring planetree uttering shrill squeaks i ran to see what it was i found a green grasshopper eviscerating a struggling cigale in vain did the latter squeak and gesticulate the other never loosed its hold but plunged its head into the entrails of the victim and removed them by little mouthfuls illustration 1 the cigale laying her eggs 2 the green grasshopper the false cigale of the north devouring the true cigale a dweller in the south this was instructive the attack was delivered high up above my head in the early morning while the cigale was resting and the struggles of the unfortunate creature as it was dissected alive had resulted in the fall of assailant and assailed together since then i have often been the witness of similar assassinations i have even seen the grasshopper full of audacity launch itself in pursuit of the cigale who fled in terror so the sparrowhawk pursues the skylark in the open sky but the bird of prey is less ferocious than the insect it pursues a creature smaller than itself the locust on the contrary assails a colossus far larger and far more vigorous than its enemy yet the result is a foregone conclusion in spite of this disproportion with its powerful mandibles like pincers of steel the grasshopper rarely fails to eviscerate its captive which being weaponless can only shriek and struggle the cigale is an easy prey during its hours of somnolence every cigale encountered by the ferocious grasshopper on its nocturnal round must miserably perish thus are explained those sudden squeaks of anguish which are sometimes heard in the boughs during the hours of the night and early morning although the cymbals have long been silent the seagreen bandit has fallen upon some slumbering cigale when i wished to rear some green grasshoppers i had not far to seek for the diet of my pensioners i fed them on cigales of which enormous numbers were consumed in my breedingcages it is therefore an established fact that the green grasshopper the false cigale of the north will eagerly devour the true cigale the inhabitant of the midi but it is neither the sparrow nor the green grasshopper that has forced the cigale to produce such a vast number of offspring the real danger is elsewhere as we shall see the risk is enormous at the moment of hatching and also when the egg is laid two or three weeks after its escape from the earththat is about the middle of julythe cigale begins to lay in order to observe the process without trusting too much to chance i took certain precautions which would i felt sure prove successful the dry asphodelus is the support preferred by the insect as previous observations had assured me it was also the plant which best lent itself to my experiments on account of its long smooth stems now during the first years of my residence in the south i replaced the thistles in my paddock by other native plants of a less stubborn and prickly species among the new occupants was the asphodel this was precisely what i needed for my experiments i left the dry stems of the preceding year in place and when the breeding season arrived i inspected them daily i had not long to wait as early as july 15th i found as many cigales as i could wish on the stems of the asphodel all in process of laying the gravid female is always solitary each mother has her twig to herself and is in no danger of being disturbed during the delicate operation of laying when the first occupant has departed another may take her place and so on indefinitely there is abundance of room for all but each prefers to be alone as her turn arrives there is however no unpleasantness of any kind everything passes most peacefully if a female cigale finds a place which has been already taken she flies away and seeks another twig directly she discovers her mistake the gravid female always retains an upright position at this time as indeed she does at other times she is so absorbed in her task that she may readily be watched even through a magnifying glass the ovipositor which is about fourtenths of an inch in length is plunged obliquely and up to the hilt into the twig so perfect is the tool that the operation is by no means troublesome we see the cigale tremble slightly dilating and contracting the extremity of the abdomen in frequent palpitations this is all that can be seen the boring instrument consisting of a double saw alternately rises and sinks in the rind of the twig with a gentle almost imperceptible movement nothing in particular occurs during the process of laying the eggs the insect is motionless and hardly ten minutes elapse between the first cut of the ovipositor and the filling of the eggchamber with eggs the ovipositor is then withdrawn with methodical deliberation in order that it may not be strained or bent the eggchamber closes of its own accord as the woody fibres which have been displaced return to their position and the cigale climbs a little higher moving upwards in a straight line by about the length of its ovipositor it then makes another puncture and a fresh chamber for another ten or twelve eggs in this way it scales the twig from bottom to top these facts being understood we are able to explain the remarkable arrangement of the eggs the openings in the rind of the twig are practically equidistant since each time the cigale moves upward it is by a given length namely that of the ovipositor very rapid in flight she is a very idle walker at the most you may see her on the living twig from which she is drinking moving at a slow almost solemn pace to gain a more sunny point close at hand on the dry twig in which she deposits her eggs she observes the same formal habits and even exaggerates them in view of the importance of the operation she moves as little as possible just so far as she must in order to avoid running two adjacent eggchambers into one the extent of each movement upwards is approximately determined by the depth of the perforation the apertures are arranged in a straight line when their number is not very large why indeed should the insect wander to right or to left upon a twig which presents the same surface all over a lover of the sun she chooses that side of the twig which is most exposed to it so long as she feels the heat her supreme joy upon her back she will take good care not to change the position which she finds so delightful for another in which the sun would fall upon her less directly the process of depositing the eggs is a lengthy one when it is carried out entirely on the same twig counting ten minutes for each eggchamber the full series of forty would represent a period of six or seven hours the sun will of course move through a considerable distance before the cigale can finish her work in such cases the series of apertures follows a spiral curve the insect turns round the stalk as the sun turns very often as the cigale is absorbed in her maternal task a diminutive fly also full of eggs busily exterminates the cigales eggs as fast as they are laid this insect was known to raumur in nearly all the twigs examined he found its grub the cause of a misunderstanding at the beginning of his researches but he did not could not see the audacious insect at work it is one of the chalcidid about onefifth or onesixth of an inch in length entirely black with knotty antenn which are slightly thicker towards their extremities the unsheathed ovipositor is implanted in the under portion of the abdomen about the middle and at right angles to the axis of the body as in the case of the leucospis the pest of the apiary not having taken the precaution to capture it i do not know what name the entomologists have bestowed upon it or even if this dwarf exterminator of the cigale has as yet been catalogued what i am familiar with is its calm temerity its impudent audacity in the presence of the colossus who could crush it with a foot i have seen as many as three at once exploiting the unfortunate female they keep close behind the cigale working busily with their probes or waiting until their victim deposits her eggs the cigale fills one of her eggchambers and climbs a little higher in order to bore another hole one of the bandits runs to the abandoned station and there almost under the claws of the giant and without the least nervousness as if it were accomplishing some meritorious action it unsheathes its probe and thrusts it into the column of eggs not by the open aperture which is bristling with broken fibres but by a lateral fissure the probes works slowly as the wood is almost intact the cigale has time to fill the adjacent chamber as soon as she has finished one of these midges the very same that has been performing its task below her replaces her and introduces its disastrous egg by the time the cigale departs her ovaries empty the majority of the eggchambers have thus received the alien egg which will work the destruction of their contents a small quickhatching grub richly nourished on a dozen eggs will replace the family of the cigale the experience of centuries has taught the cigale nothing with her excellent eyesight she must be able to perceive these terrible sappers as they hover about her meditating their crime too peaceable giantess if you see them why do you not seize them in your talons crush the pigmies at their work so that you may proceed with your travail in security but no you will leave them untouched you cannot modify your instincts even to alleviate your maternal misfortunes the eggs of the common cigale are of a shining ivory white conical at the ends and elongated in form they might be compared in shape to the weavers shuttle their length is about onetenth of an inch their diameter about onefiftieth they are packed in a row slightly overlapping one another the eggs of the cacan are slightly smaller and are assembled in regular groups which remind one of microscopical bundles of cigars we will consider the eggs of the common cigale to the exclusion of the others as their history is the history of all september is not yet over when the shining white as of ivory gives way to the yellow hue of cheese during the first days of october you may see at the forward end of the egg two tiny points of chestnut brown which are the eyes of the embryo in formation these two shining eyes which almost seem to gaze at one and the coneshaped head of the egg give it the look of a tiny fish without finsa fish for whom half a nutshell would make a capacious aquarium about the same time i notice frequently on the asphodels in the paddock and on those of the neighbouring hills certain indications that the eggs have recently hatched out there are certain castoff articles of clothing certain rags and tatters left on the threshold of the eggchamber by the newborn grubs as they leave it and hurry in search of a new lodging we shall see in a moment what these vestiges mean but in spite of my visits which were so assiduous as to deserve success i had never contrived to see the young cigales emerge from their eggchambers my domestic researches had been pursued in vain two years running i had collected in boxes tubes and bottles a hundred twigs of every kind which were peopled by the eggs of the cigale but not one had shown me what i so desired to witness the issue of the newborn cigales raumur experienced the same disappointment he tells us how all the eggs supplied by his friends were abortive even when he placed them in a glass tube thrust under his armpit in order to keep them at a high temperature no venerable master neither the temperate shelter of our studies and laboratories nor the incubating warmth of our bodies is sufficient here we need the supreme stimulant the kiss of the sun after the cool of the mornings which are already sharp the sudden blaze of the superb autumn weather the last endearments of summer it was under such circumstances when a blazing sun followed a cold night that i found the signs of completed incubation but i always came too late the young cigales had departed at most i sometimes found one hanging by a thread to its natal stem and struggling in the air i supposed it to be caught in a thread of gossamer or some shred of cobweb at last on the 27th of october despairing of success i gathered some asphodels from the orchard and the armful of dry twigs in which the cigales had laid their eggs was taken up to my study before giving up all hope i proposed once more to examine the eggchambers and their contents the morning was cold and the first fire of the season had been lit in my room i placed my little bundle on a chair before the fire but without any intention of testing the effect of the heat of the flames upon the concealed eggs the twigs which i was about to cut open one by one were placed there to be within easy reach of my hand and for no other reason then while i was examining a split twig with my magnifyingglass the phenomenon which i had given up all hope of observing took place under my eyes my bundle of twigs was suddenly alive scores and scores of the young larv were emerging from their eggchambers their numbers were such that my ambition as observer was amply satisfied the eggs were ripe on the point of hatching and the warmth of the fire bright and penetrating had the effect of sunlight in the open i was quick to profit by the unexpected piece of good fortune at the orifice of the eggchamber among the torn fibres of the bark a little coneshaped body is visible with two black eyespots in appearance it is precisely like the fore portion of the buttercoloured egg or as i have said like the fore portion of a tiny fish you would think that an egg had been somehow displaced had been removed from the bottom of the chamber to its aperture an egg to move in this narrow passage a walking egg no that is impossible eggs do not do such things this is some mistake we will break open the twig and the mystery is unveiled the actual eggs are where they always were though they are slightly disarranged they are empty reduced to the condition of transparent skins split wide open at the upper end from them has issued the singular organism whose most notable characteristics are as follows in its general form the configuration of the head and the great black eyes the creature still more than the egg has the appearance of an extremely minute fish a simulacrum of a ventral fin increases the resemblance this apparent fin in reality consists of the two forelimbs which packed in a special sheath are bent backwards stretched out against one another in a straight line its small degree of mobility must enable the grub to escape from the eggshell and with greater difficulty from the woody tunnel leading to the open air moving outwards a little from the body and then moving back again this lever serves as a means of progression its terminal hooks being already fairly strong the four other feet are still covered by the common envelope and are absolutely inert it is the same with the antenn which can scarcely be seen through the magnifyingglass the organism which has issued from the egg is a boatshaped body with a finshaped limb pointing backwards on the ventral face formed by the junction of the two forelimbs the segmentation of the body is very clear especially on the abdomen the whole body is perfectly smooth without the least suspicion of hair what name are we to give to this initial phase of the cigalea phase so strange so unforeseen and hitherto unsuspected must i amalgamate some more or less appropriate words of greek and fabricate a portentous nomenclature no for i feel sure that barbarous alien phrases are only a hindrance to science i will call it simply the primary larva as i have done in the case of the meloides the leucospis and the anthrax the form of the primary larva of the cigale is eminently adapted to its conditions and facilitates its escape the tunnel in which the egg is hatched is very narrow leaving only just room for passage moreover the eggs are arranged in a row not end to end but partially overlapping the larva escaping from the hinder ranks has to squeeze past the empty shells still in position of the eggs which have already hatched so that the narrowness of the passage is increased by the empty eggshells under these conditions the larva as it will be presently when it has torn its temporary wrappings would be unable to effect the difficult passage with the encumbrance of antenn with long limbs spreading far out from the axis of the body with curved pointed talons which hook themselves into their medium of support everything would militate against a prompt liberation the eggs in one chamber hatch almost simultaneously it is therefore essential that the firstborn larv should hurry out of their shelter as quickly as possible leaving the passage free for those behind them hence the boatlike shape the smooth hairless body without projections which easily squeezes its way past obstructions the primary larva with its various appendages closely wrapped against its body by a common sheath with its fishlike form and its single and only partially movable limb is perfectly adapted to make the difficult passage to the outer air this phase is of short duration here for instance a migrating larva shows its head with its big black eyes and raises the broken fibres of the entrance it gradually works itself forward but so slowly that the magnifyingglass scarcely reveals its progress at the end of half an hour at the shortest we see the entire body of the creature but the orifice by which it is escaping still holds it by the hinder end of the body then without further delay the coat which it wears for this rough piece of work begins to split and the larva skins itself coming out of its wrappings head first it is then the normal larva the only form known to raumur the rejected coat forms a suspensory thread expanding at its free end to form a little cup in this cup is inserted the end of the abdomen of the larva which before allowing itself to fall to earth takes a sunbath grows harder stretches itself and tries its strength lightly swinging at the end of its lifeline this little flea as raumur calls it first white then ambercoloured is precisely the larva which will delve in the earth the antenn of fair length are free and waving to and fro the limbs are bending at their articulations the forelimbs which are relatively powerful open and shut their talons i can scarcely think of any more curious spectacle than that of this tiny gymnast hanging by its tail swinging to the faintest breath and preparing in the air for its entry into the world it hangs there for a variable period some larv let themselves fall at the end of half an hour others spend hours in their longstemmed cup some even remain suspended until the following day whether soon or late the fall of the larva leaves suspended the thread by which it hung the wrappings of the primary larva when all the brood have disappeared the aperture of the nest is thus hung with a branch of fine short threads twisted and knotted together like dried white of egg each thread is expanded into a tiny cup at its free end these are very delicate and ephemeral relics which perish at a touch the least wind quickly blows them away let us return to the larva sooner or later as we have seen it falls to the ground either by accident or intention the tiny creature no bigger than a flea has preserved its tender newlyhatched flesh from contact with the rough earth by hanging in the air until its tissues have hardened now it plunges into the troubles of life i foresee a thousand dangers ahead a mere breath of wind may carry this atom away and cast it on that inaccessible rock in the midst of a rut in the road which still contains a little water or on the sand the region of famine where nothing grows or upon a soil of clay too tenacious to be tunnelled these mortal accidents are frequent for gusts of wind are frequent in the windy and already severe weather of the end of october this delicate organism requires a very soft soil which can easily be entered so that it may immediately obtain a suitable shelter the cold days are coming soon the frosts will be here to wander on the surface would expose it to grave perils it must contrive without delay to descend into the earth and that to no trivial depth this is the unique and imperative condition of safety and in many cases it is impossible of realisation what use are the claws of this tiny flea against rock sandstone or hardened clay the creature must perish if it cannot find a subterranean refuge in good time everything goes to show that the necessity of this first foothold on the soil subject as it is to so many accidents is the cause of the great mortality in the cigale family the little black parasite the destroyer of eggs in itself evokes the necessity of a large batch of eggs and the difficulty which the larva experiences in effecting a safe lodgment in the earth is yet another explanation of the fact that the maintenance of the race at its proper strength requires a batch of three or four hundred eggs from each mother subject to many accidents the cigale is fertile to excess by the prodigality of her ovaries she conjures the host of perils which threaten her offspring during the rest of my experiment i can at least spare the larv the worst difficulties of their first establishment underground i take some soil from the heath which is very soft and almost black and i pass it through a fine sieve its colour will enable me more easily to find the tiny fairskinned larv when i wish to inform myself of passing events its lightness makes it a suitable refuge for such weak and fragile beings i pack it pretty firmly in a glass vase i plant in it a little tuft of thyme i sow in it a few grains of wheat there is no hole at the bottom of the vase although there should be one for the benefit of the thyme and the corn but the captives would find it and escape by it the plantation and the crop will suffer from this lack of drainage but at least i am sure of recovering my larv with the help of patience and a magnifyingglass moreover i shall go gently in the matter of irrigation giving only just enough water to save the plants from perishing when all is in order and when the wheat is beginning to shoot i place six young larv of the cigale on the surface of the soil the tiny creatures begin to pace hither and thither they soon explore the surface of their world and some try vainly to climb the sides of the vase not one of them seems inclined to bury itself so that i ask myself anxiously what can be the object of their prolonged and active explorations two hours go by but their wanderings continue what do they want food i offer them some tiny bulbs with bundles of sprouting roots a few fragments of leaves and some fresh blades of grass nothing tempts them nothing brings them to a standstill apparently they are seeking for a favourable point before descending into the earth but there is no need for this hesitating exploration on the soil i have prepared for them the whole area or so it seems to me lends itself excellently to the operations which i am expecting to see them commence yet apparently it will not answer the purpose under natural conditions a little wandering might well be indispensable spots as soft as my bed of earth from the roots of the briarheather purged of all hard bodies and finely sifted are rare in nature coarse soils are more usual on which the tiny creatures could make no impression the larva must wander at hazard must make a pilgrimage of indefinite duration before finding a favourable place very many no doubt perish exhausted by their fruitless search a voyage of exploration in a country a few inches wide evidently forms part of the curriculum of young cigales in my glass prison so luxuriously furnished this pilgrimage is useless never mind it must be accomplished according to the consecrated rites at last my wanderers grow less excited i see them attack the earth with the curved talons of their forelimbs digging their claws into it and making such an excavation as the point of a thick needle would enter with a magnifyingglass i watch their picks at work i see their talons raking atom after atom of earth to the surface in a few minutes there is a little gaping well the larva climbs downwards and buries itself henceforth invisible on the morrow i turn out the contents of the vase without breaking the mould which is held together by the roots of the thyme and the wheat i find all my larv at the bottom arrested by the glass in twentyfour hours they had sunk themselves through the entire thickness of the eartha matter of some four inches but for obstacle at the bottom they would have sunk even further on the way they have probably encountered the rootlets of my little plantation did they halt in order to take a little nourishment by implanting their proboscis this is hardly probable for a few rootlets were pressed against the bottom of the glass but none of my prisoners were feeding perhaps the shock of reversing the pot detached them it is obvious that underground there is no other nourishment for them than the sap of roots adult or larva the cigale is a strict vegetarian as an adult insect it drinks the sap of twigs and branches as a larva it sucks the sap of roots but at what stage does it take the first sip that i do not know as yet but the foregoing experiment seems to show that the newly hatched larva is in greater haste to burrow deep into the soil so as to obtain shelter from the coming winter than to station itself at the roots encountered in its passage downwards i replace the mass of soil in the vase and the six exhumed larv are once more placed on the surface of the soil this time they commence to dig at once and have soon disappeared finally the vase is placed in my study window where it will be subject to the influences good and ill of the outer air a month later at the end of november i pay the young cigales a second visit they are crouching isolated at the bottom of the mould they do not adhere to the roots they have not grown their appearance has not altered such as they were at the beginning of the experiment such they are now but rather less active does not this lack of growth during november the mildest month of winter prove that no nourishment is taken until the spring the young sitares which are also very minute directly they issue from the egg at the entrance of the tubes of the anthrophorus remain motionless assembled in a heap and pass the whole of the winter in a state of complete abstinence the young cigales apparently behave in a very similar fashion once they have burrowed to such depths as will safeguard them from the frosts they sleep in solitude in their winter quarters and await the return of spring before piercing some neighbouring root and taking their first repast i have tried unsuccessfully to confirm these deductions by observation in april i unpotted my plant of thyme for the third time i broke up the mould and spread it under the magnifyingglass it was like looking for needles in a haystack but at last i recovered my little cigales they were dead perhaps of cold in spite of the bellglass with which i had covered the pot or perhaps of starvation if the thyme was not a suitable foodplant i give up the problem as too difficult of solution to rear such larv successfully one would require a deep extensive bed of earth which would shelter them from the winter cold and as i do not know what roots they prefer a varied vegetation so that the little creatures could choose according to their taste these conditions are by no means impracticable but how in the large earthy mass containing at least a cubic yard of soil should we recover the atoms i had so much trouble to find in a handful of black soil from the heath moreover such a laborious search would certainly detach the larva from its root the early subterranean life of the cigale escapes us that of the maturer larva is no better known nothing is more common while digging in the fields to any depth to find these impetuous excavators under the spade but to surprise them fixed upon the roots which incontestably nourish them is quite another matter the disturbance of the soil warns the larva of danger it withdraws its proboscis in order to retreat along its galleries and when the spade uncovers it has ceased to feed if the hazards of fieldwork with its inevitable disturbance of the larv cannot teach us anything of their subterranean habits we can at least learn something of the duration of the larval stage some obliging farmers who were making some deep excavations in march were good enough to collect for me all the larv large and small unearthed in the course of their labour the total collection amounted to several hundreds they were divided by very clearly marked differences of size into three categories the large larv with rudiments of wings such as those larv caught upon leaving the earth possess the mediumsized and the small each of these stages must correspond to a different age to these we may add the larv produced by the last hatching of eggs creatures too minute to be noticed by my rustic helpers and we obtain four years as the probable term of the larv underground the length of their aerial existence is more easily computed i hear the first cigales about the summer solstice a month later the orchestra has attained its full power a very few late singers execute their feeble solos until the middle of september this is the end of the concert as all the larv do not issue from the ground at the same time it is evident that the singers of september are not contemporary with those that began to sing at the solstice taking the average between these two dates we get five weeks as the probable duration of the cigales life on earth four years of hard labour underground and a month of feasting in the sun such is the life of the cigale do not let us again reproach the adult insect with his triumphant delirium for four years in the darkness he has worn a dirty parchment overall for four years he has mined the soil with his talons and now the mudstained sapper is suddenly clad in the finest raiment and provided with wings that rival the birds moreover he is drunken with heat and flooded with light the supreme terrestrial joy his cymbals will never suffice to celebrate such felicity so well earned although so ephemeral chapter v the mantisthe chase there is another creature of the midi which is quite as curious and interesting as the cigale but much less famous as it is voiceless if providence had provided it with cymbals which are a prime element of popularity it would soon have eclipsed the renown of the celebrated singer so strange is its shape and so peculiar its manners it is called by the provenals lou prgodiu the creature which prays to god its official name is the praying mantis mantis religiosa lin for once the language of science and the vocabulary of the peasant agree both represent the mantis as a priestess delivering oracles or an ascetic in a mystic ecstasy the comparison is a matter of antiquity the ancient greeks called the insect greek mantis the divine the prophet the worker in the fields is never slow in perceiving analogies he will always generously supplement the vagueness of the facts he has seen on the sunburned herbage of the meadows an insect of commanding appearance drawn up in majestic attitude he has noticed its wide delicate wings of green trailing behind it like long linen veils he has seen its forelimbs its arms so to speak raised towards to the sky in a gesture of invocation this was enough popular imagination has done the rest so that since the period of classical antiquity the bushes have been peopled with priestesses emitting oracles and nuns in prayer good people how very far astray your childlike simplicity has led you these attitudes of prayer conceal the most atrocious habits these supplicating arms are lethal weapons these fingers tell no rosaries but help to exterminate the unfortunate passerby it is an exception that we should never look for in the vegetarian family of the orthoptera but the mantis lives exclusively upon living prey it is the tiger of the peaceful insect peoples the ogre in ambush which demands a tribute of living flesh if it only had sufficient strength its bloodthirsty appetites and its horrible perfection of concealment would make it the terror of the countryside the prgodiu would become a satanic vampire apart from its lethal weapon the mantis has nothing about it to inspire apprehension it does not lack a certain appearance of graciousness with its slender body its elegant waistline its tender green colouring and its long gauzy wings no ferocious jaws opening like shears on the contrary a fine pointed muzzle which seems to be made for billing and cooing thanks to a flexible neck set freely upon the thorax the head can turn to right or left as on a pivot bow or raise itself high in the air alone among insects the mantis is able to direct its gaze it inspects and examines it has almost a physiognomy there is a very great contrast between the body as a whole which has a perfectly peaceable aspect and the murderous forelimbs the haunch of the forelimb is unusually long and powerful its object is to throw forward the living trap which does not wait for the victim but goes in search of it the snare is embellished with a certain amount of ornamentation on the inner face the base of the haunch is decorated with a pretty black spot relieved by smaller spots of white and a few rows of fine pearly spots complete the ornamentation the thigh still longer like a flattened spindle carries on the forward half of the lower face a double row of steely spines the innermost row contains a dozen alternately long and black and short and green this alternation of unequal lengths makes the weapon more effectual for holding the outer row is simpler having only four teeth finally three needlelike spikes the longest of all rise behind the double series of spikes in short the thigh is a saw with two parallel edges separated by a groove in which the foreleg lies when folded the foreleg which is attached to the thigh by a very flexible articulation is also a doubleedged saw but the teeth are smaller more numerous and closer than those of the thigh it terminates in a strong hook the point of which is as sharp as the finest needle a hook which is fluted underneath and has a double blade like a pruningknife a weapon admirably adapted for piercing and tearing this hook has sometimes left me with visible remembrances caught in turn by the creature which i had just captured and not having both hands free i have often been obliged to get a second person to free me from my tenacious captive to free oneself by violence without disengaging the firmly implanted talons would result in lacerations such as the thorns of a rosebush will produce none of our insects is so inconvenient to handle the mantis digs its knifeblades into your flesh pierces you with its needles seizes you as in a vice and renders selfdefence almost impossible if wishing to take your quarry alive you refrain from crushing it out of existence when the mantis is in repose its weapons are folded and pressed against the thorax and are perfectly inoffensive in appearance the insect is apparently praying but let a victim come within reach and the attitude of prayer is promptly abandoned suddenly unfolded the three long joints of the deadly forelimbs shoot out their terminal talons which strike the victim and drag it backwards between the two sawblades of the thighs the vice closes with a movement like that of the forearm upon the upper arm and all is over crickets grasshoppers and even more powerful insects once seized in this trap with its four rows of teeth are lost irreparably their frantic struggles will never release the hold of this terrible engine of destruction the habits of the mantis cannot be continuously studied in the freedom of the fields the insect must be domesticated there is no difficulty here the mantis is quite indifferent to imprisonment under glass provided it is well fed offer it a tasty diet feed it daily and it will feel but little regret for its native thickets for cages i use a dozen large covers of wire gauze such as are used in the larder to protect meat from the flies each rests upon a tray full of sand a dry tuft of thyme and a flat stone on which the eggs may be laid later on complete the furnishing of such a dwelling these cages are placed in a row on the large table in my entomological laboratory where the sun shines on them during the greater part of the day there i install my captives some singly some in groups it is in the latter half of august that i begin to meet with the adult insect on the faded herbage and the brambles at the roadside the females whose bellies are already swollen are more numerous every day their slender companions on the other hand are somewhat rare and i often have some trouble in completing my couples whose relations will finally be terminated by a tragic consummation but we will reserve these amenities for a later time and will consider the females first they are tremendous eaters so that their entertainment when it lasts for some months is not without difficulties their provisions must be renewed every day for the greater part are disdainfully tasted and thrown aside on its native bushes i trust the mantis is more economical game is not too abundant so that she doubtless devours her prey to the last atom but in my cages it is always at hand often after a few mouthfuls the insect will drop the juicy morsel without displaying any further interest in it such is the ennui of captivity to provide them with a luxurious table i have to call in assistants two or three of the juvenile unemployed of my neighbourhood bribed by slices of bread and jam or of melon search morning and evening on the neighbouring lawns where they fill their gamebags little cases made from sections of reeds with living grasshoppers and crickets on my own part i make a daily tour of the paddock net in hand with the object of obtaining some choice dish for my guests these particular captures are destined to show me just how far the vigour and audacity of the mantis will lead it they include the large grey cricket pachytylus cinerascens fab which is larger than the creature which devours it the whitefaced decticus armed with powerful mandibles from which it is wise to guard ones fingers the grotesque truxalis wearing a pyramidal mitre on its head and the ephippigera of the vineyards which clashes its cymbals and carries a sabre at the end of its barrelshaped abdomen to this assortment of disobliging creatures let us add two horrors the silky epeirus whose discshaped scalloped abdomen is as big as a shilling and the crowned epeirus which is horribly hairy and corpulent i cannot doubt that the mantis attacks such adversaries in a state of nature when i see it under my wiregauze covers boldly give battle to whatever is placed before it lying in wait among the bushes it must profit by the prizes bestowed upon it by hazard as in its cage it profits by the wealth of diet due to my generosity the hunting of such big game as i offer which is full of danger must form part of the creatures usual life though it may be only an occasional pastime perhaps to the great regret of the mantis crickets of all kinds butterflies bees large flies of many species and other insects of moderate size such is the prey that we habitually find in the embrace of the murderous arms of the mantis but in my cages i have never known the audacious huntress to recoil before any other insect grey cricket decticus epeirus or truxalis sooner or later all are harpooned held motionless between the sawedges of the arms and deliciously crunched at leisure the process deserves a detailed description at the sight of a great cricket which thoughtlessly approaches along the wirework of the cover the mantis shaken by a convulsive start suddenly assumes a most terrifying posture an electric shock would not produce a more immediate result the transition is so sudden the mimicry so threatening that the unaccustomed observer will draw back his hand as though at some unknown danger seasoned as i am i myself must confess to being startled on occasions when my thoughts have been elsewhere the creature spreads out like a fan actuated by a spring or a fantastic jackinthebox the wingcovers open and are thrust obliquely aside the wings spring to their full width standing up like parallel screens of transparent gauze forming a pyramidal prominence which dominates the back the end of the abdomen curls upwards crosierwise then falls and unbends itself with a sort of swishing noise a pouf pouf like the sound emitted by the feathers of a strutting turkeycock one is reminded of the puffing of a startled adder proudly straddling on its four hindclaws the insect holds its long body almost vertical the murderous forelimbs at first folded and pressed against one another on the thorax open to their full extent forming a cross with the body and exhibiting the axill ornamented with rows of pearls and a black spot with a central point of white these two eyes faintly recalling those of the peacocks tail and the fine ebony embossments are part of the blazonry of conflict concealed upon ordinary occasions their jewels are only assumed when they make themselves terrible and superb for battle motionless in its weird position the mantis surveys the acridian its gaze fixed upon it its head turning gently as on a pivot as the other changes place the object of this mimicry seems evident the mantis wishes to terrorise its powerful prey to paralyse it with fright for if not demoralised by fear the quarry might prove too dangerous does it really terrify its prey under the shining head of the decticus behind the long face of the cricket who is to say what is passing no sign of emotion can reveal itself upon these immovable masks yet it seems certain that the threatened creature is aware of its danger it sees springing up before it a terrible spectral form with talons outstretched ready to fall upon it it feels itself face to face with death and fails to flee while yet there is time the creature that excels in leaping and might so easily escape from the threatening claws the wonderful jumper with the prodigious thighs remains crouching stupidly in its place or even approaches the enemy with deliberate steps2 it is said that young birds paralysed with terror by the gaping mouth of a serpent or fascinated by its gaze will allow themselves to be snatched from the nest incapable of movement the cricket will often behave in almost the same way once within reach of the enchantress the grapplinghooks are thrown the fangs strike the double saws close together and hold the victim in a vice vainly the captive struggles his mandibles chew the air his desperate kicks meet with no resistance he has met with his fate the mantis refolds her wings the standard of battle she resumes her normal pose and the meal commences in attacking the truxalis and the ephippigera less dangerous game than the grey cricket and the decticus the spectral pose is less imposing and of shorter duration it is often enough to throw forward the talons this is so in the case of the epeirus which is seized by the middle of the body without a thought of its venomous claws with the smaller crickets which are the customary diet in my cages as at liberty the mantis rarely employs her means of intimidation she merely seizes the heedless passerby as she lies in wait when the insect to be captured may present some serious resistance the mantis is thus equipped with a pose which terrifies or perplexes fascinates or absorbs the prey while it enables her talons to strike with greater certainty her gins close on a demoralised victim incapable of or unready for defence she freezes the quarry with fear or amazement by suddenly assuming the attitude of a spectre the wings play an important part in this fantastic pose they are very wide green on the outer edge but colourless and transparent elsewhere numerous nervures spreading out fanwise cross them in the direction of their length others transversal but finer cut the first at right angles forming with them a multitude of meshes in the spectral attitude the wings are outspread and erected in two parallel planes which are almost in contact like the wings of butterflies in repose between the two the end of the abdomen rapidly curls and uncurls from the rubbing of the belly against the network of nervures proceeds the species of puffing sound which i have compared to the hissing of an adder in a posture of defence to imitate this curious sound it is enough rapidly to stroke the upper face of an outstretched wing with the tip of the fingernail in a moment of hunger after a fast of some days the large grey cricket which is as large as the mantis or larger will be entirely consumed with the exception of the wings which are too dry two hours are sufficient for the completion of this enormous meal such an orgy is rare i have witnessed it two or three times always asking myself where the gluttonous creature found room for so much food and how it contrived to reverse in its own favour the axiom that the content is less than that which contains it i can only admire the privileges of a stomach in which matter is digested immediately upon entrance dissolved and made away with the usual diet of the mantis under my wire cages consists of crickets of different species and varying greatly in size it is interesting to watch the mantis nibbling at its cricket which it holds in the vice formed by its murderous forelimbs in spite of the finepointed muzzle which hardly seems made for such ferocity the entire insect disappears excepting the wings of which only the base which is slightly fleshy is consumed legs claws horny integuments all else is eaten sometimes the great hinder thigh is seized by the knuckle carried to the mouth tasted and crunched with a little air of satisfaction the swollen thigh of the cricket might well be a choice cut for the mantis as a leg of lamb is for us the attack on the victim begins at the back of the neck or base of the head while one of the murderous talons holds the quarry gripped by the middle of the body the other presses the head downwards so that the articulation between the back and the neck is stretched and opens slightly the snout of the mantis gnaws and burrows into this undefended spot with a certain persistence and a large wound is opened in the neck at the lesion of the cephalic ganglions the struggles of the cricket grow less and the victim becomes a motionless corpse thence unrestricted in its movements this beast of prey chooses its mouthfuls at leisure chapter vi the mantiscourtship the little we have seen of the customs of the mantis does not square very well with the popular name for the insect from the term prgodiu we should expect a peaceful placid creature devoutly selfabsorbed and we find a cannibal a ferocious spectre biting open the heads of its captives after demoralising them with terror but we have yet to learn the worst the customs of the mantis in connection with its own kin are more atrocious even than those of the spiders who bear an ill repute in this respect to reduce the number of cages on my big laboratory table to give myself a little more room while still maintaining a respectable menagerie i installed several females under one cover there was sufficient space in the common lodging and room for the captives to move about though for that matter they are not fond of movement being heavy in the abdomen crouching motionless against the wire work of the cover they will digest their food or await a passing victim they lived in short just as they lived on their native bushes communal life has its dangers when the hay is low in the manger donkeys grow quarrelsome although usually so pacific my guests might well in a season of dearth have lost their tempers and begun to fight one another but i was careful to keep the cages well provided with crickets which were renewed twice a day if civil war broke out famine could not be urged in excuse at the outset matters did not go badly the company lived in peace each mantis pouncing upon and eating whatever came her way without interfering with her neighbours but this period of concord was of brief duration the bellies of the insects grew fuller the eggs ripened in their ovaries the time of courtship and the laying season was approaching then a kind of jealous rage seized the females although no male was present to arouse such feminine rivalry the swelling of the ovaries perverted my flock and infected them with an insane desire to devour one another there were threats horrid encounters and cannibal feasts once more the spectral pose was seen the hissing of the wings and the terrible gesture of the talons outstretched and raised above the head the females could not have looked more terrible before a grey cricket or a decticus without any motives that i could see two neighbours suddenly arose in the attitude of conflict they turned their heads to the right and the left provoking one another insulting one another the pouf pouf of the wings rubbed by the abdomen sounded the charge although the duel was to terminate at the first scratch without any more serious consequence the murderous talons at first folded open like the leaves of a book and are extended laterally to protect the long waist and abdomen the pose is superb but less terrific than that assumed when the fight is to be to the death then one of the grapplinghooks with a sudden spring flies out and strikes the rival with the same suddenness it flies back and assumes a position of guard the adversary replies with a riposte the fencing reminds one not a little of two cats boxing one anothers ears at the first sign of blood on the soft abdomen or even at the slightest wound one admits herself to be conquered and retires the other refurls her battle standard and goes elsewhere to meditate the capture of a cricket apparently calm but in reality ready to recommence the quarrel very often the matter turns out more tragically in duels to the death the pose of attack is assumed in all its beauty the murderous talons unfold and rise in the air woe to the vanquished for the victor seizes her in her vicelike grip and at once commences to eat her beginning needless to say at the back of the neck the odious meal proceeds as calmly as if it were merely a matter of munching a grasshopper and the survivor enjoys her sister quite as much as lawful game the spectators do not protest being only too willing to do the like on the first occasion ferocious creatures it is said that even wolves do not eat one another the mantis is not so scrupulous she will eat her fellows when her favourite quarry the cricket is attainable and abundant these observations reach a yet more revolting extreme let us inquire into the habits of the insect at breeding time and to avoid the confusion of a crowd let us isolate the couples under different covers thus each pair will have their own dwelling where nothing can trouble their honeymoon we will not forget to provide them with abundant food there shall not be the excuse of hunger for what is to follow we are near the end of august the male mantis a slender and elegant lover judges the time to be propitious he makes eyes at his powerful companion he turns his head towards her he bows his neck and raises his thorax his little pointed face almost seems to wear an expression for a long time he stands thus motionless in contemplation of the desired one the latter as though indifferent does not stir yet the lover has seized upon a sign of consent a sign of which i do not know the secret he approaches suddenly he erects his wings which are shaken with a convulsive tremor this is his declaration he throws himself timidly on the back of his corpulent companion he clings to her desperately and steadies himself the prelude to the embrace is generally lengthy and the embrace will sometimes last for five or six hours nothing worthy of notice occurs during this time finally the two separate but they are soon to be made one flesh in a much more intimate fashion if the poor lover is loved by his mistress as the giver of fertility she also loves him as the choicest of game during the day or at latest on the morrow he is seized by his companion who first gnaws through the back of his neck according to use and wont and then methodically devours him mouthful by mouthful leaving only the wings here we have no case of jealousy but simply a depraved taste i had the curiosity to wonder how a second male would be received by a newly fecundated female the result of my inquiry was scandalous the mantis in only too many cases is never sated with embraces and conjugal feasts after a rest of variable duration whether the eggs have been laid or not a second male is welcomed and devoured like the first a third succeeds him does his duty and affords yet another meal a fourth suffers a like fate in the course of two weeks i have seen the same mantis treat seven husbands in this fashion she admitted all to her embraces and all paid for the nuptial ecstasy with their lives there are exceptions but such orgies are frequent on very hot days when the atmospheric tension is high they are almost the general rule at such times the mantis is all nerves under covers which contain large households the females devour one another more frequently than ever under the covers which contain isolated couples the males are devoured more eagerly than usual when their office has been fulfilled i might urge in mitigation of these conjugal atrocities that the mantis does not commit them when at liberty the male his function once fulfilled surely has time to wander off to escape far away to flee the terrible spouse for in my cages he is given a respite often of a whole day what really happens by the roadside and in the thickets i do not know chance a poor schoolmistress has never instructed me concerning the loveaffairs of the mantis when at liberty i am obliged to watch events in my laboratory where the captives enjoying plenty of sunshine well nourished and comfortably lodged do not seem in any way to suffer from nostalgia they should behave there as they behave under normal conditions alas the facts force me to reject the statement that the males have time to escape for i once surprised a male apparently in the performance of his vital functions holding the female tightly embracedbut he had no head no neck scarcely any thorax the female her head turned over her shoulder was peacefully browsing on the remains of her lover and the masculine remnant firmly anchored continued its duty love it is said is stronger than death taken literally never has an aphorism received a more striking confirmation here was a creature decapitated amputated as far as the middle of the thorax a corpse which still struggled to give life it would not relax its hold until the abdomen itself the seat of the organs of procreation was attacked the custom of eating the lover after the consummation of the nuptials of making a meal of the exhausted pigmy who is henceforth good for nothing is not so difficult to understand since insects can hardly be accused of sentimentality but to devour him during the act surpasses anything that the most morbid mind could imagine i have seen the thing with my own eyes and i have not yet recovered from my surprise could this unfortunate creature have fled and saved himself being thus attacked in the performance of his functions no we must conclude that the loves of the mantis are fully as tragic perhaps even more so than those of the spider i do not deny that the limited area of the cage may favour the massacre of the males but the cause of such butchering must be sought elsewhere it is perhaps a reminiscence of the carboniferous period when the insect world gradually took shape through prodigious procreation the orthoptera of which the mantes form a branch are the firstborn of the insect world uncouth incomplete in their transformation they wandered amidst the arborescent foliage already flourishing when none of the insects sprung of more complex forms of metamorphosis were as yet in existence neither butterflies beetles flies nor bees manners were not gentle in those epochs which were full of the lust to destroy in order to produce and the mantis a feeble memory of those ancient ghosts might well preserve the customs of an earlier age the utilisation of the males as food is a custom in the case of other members of the mantis family it is i must admit a general habit the little grey mantis so small and looking so harmless in her cage which never seeks to harm her neighbours in spite of her crowded quarters falls upon her male and devours him as ferociously as the praying mantis i have worn myself out in trying to procure the indispensable complements to my female specimens no sooner is my capture strongly winged vigorous and alert introduced into the cage than he is seized more often than not by one of the females who no longer have need of his assistance and devoured once the ovaries are satisfied the two species of mantis conceive an antipathy for the male or rather they regard him merely as a particularly tasty species of game chapter vii the mantisthe nest let us take a more pleasant aspect of the insect whose loves are so tragic its nest is a marvel in scientific language it is known as the ootek or the eggbox i shall not make use of this barbarous expression as one does not speak of the eggbox of the titmouse meaning the nest of the titmouse why should i invoke the box in speaking of the mantis it may look more scientific but that does not interest me the nest of the praying mantis may be found almost everywhere in places exposed to the sun on stones wood vine stocks the twigs of bushes stems of dried grass and even on products of human industry such as fragments of brick rags of heavy cloth and pieces of old boots any support will suffice so long as it offers inequalities to which the base of the nest may adhere and so provide a solid foundation the usual dimensions of the nest are one and a half inches long by threequarters of an inch wide or a trifle larger the colour is a pale tan like that of a grain of wheat brought in contact with a flame the nest burns readily and emits an odour like that of burning silk the material of the nest is in fact a substance similar to silk but instead of being drawn into a thread it is allowed to harden while a mass of spongy foam if the nest is fixed on a branch the base creeps round it envelops the neighbouring twigs and assumes a variable shape according to the accidents of support if it is fixed on a flat surface the under side which is always moulded by the support is itself flat the nest then takes the form of a demiellipsoid or in other words half an egg cut longitudinally more or less obtuse at one end but pointed at the other and sometimes ending in a short curved tail in all cases the upper face is convex and regular in it we can distinguish three wellmarked and longitudinal zones the middle zone which is narrower than the others is composed of thin plates arranged in couples and overlapping like the tiles of a roof the edges of these plates are free leaving two parallel series of fissures by which the young can issue when the eggs are hatched in a nest recently abandoned this zone is covered with fine castoff skins which shiver at the least breath and soon disappear when exposed to the open air i will call this zone the zone of issue as it is only along this bell that the young can escape being set free by those that have preceded them in all other directions the cradle of this numerous family presents an unbroken wall the two lateral zones which occupy the greater part of the demiellipsoid have a perfect continuity of surface the little mantes which are very feeble when first hatched could not possibly make their way through the tenacious substance of the walls on the interior of these walls are a number of fine transverse furrows signs of the various layers in which the mass of eggs is disposed let us cut the nest in half transversely we shall then see that the mass of eggs constitutes an elongated core of very firm consistency surrounded as to the bottom and sides by a thick porous rind like solidified foam above the eggs are the curved plates which are set very closely and have little freedom their edges constituting the zone of issue where they form a double series of small overlapping scales the eggs are set in a yellowish medium of horny appearance they are arranged in layers in lines forming arcs of a circle with the cephalic extremities converging towards the zone of issue this orientation tells us of the method of delivery the newlyborn larv will slip into the interval between two adjacent flaps or leaves which form a prolongation of the core they will then find a narrow passage none too easy to effect but sufficient having regard to the curious provision which we shall deal with directly they will then reach the zone of issue there under the overlapping scales two passages of exit open for each layer of eggs half the larv will issue by the righthand passage half by that on the left hand this process is repeated for each layer from end to end of the nest let us sum up those structural details which are not easily grasped unless one has the nest before one lying along the axis of the nest and in shape like a datestone is the mass of eggs grouped in layers a protective rind a kind of solidified foam envelops this core except at the top along the central line where the porous rind is replaced by thin overlapping leaves the free edges of these leaves form the exterior of the zone of issue they overlap one another forming two series of scales leaving two exits in the shape of narrow crevices for each layer of eggs illustration 1 nest of the praying mantis 2 transverse section of the same 3 3a nest of empusa pauperata 4 transverse section of the same 5 vertical selection of the same 6 nest of the grey mantis 7 scheffers sisyphus see chap xii 8 pellet of the sisyphus 9 pellet of the sisyphus with dejecta of the larva forced through the walls to be present at the construction of the nestto learn how the mantis contrives to build so complex a structuresuch was the main point of my researches i succeeded not without difficulty as the eggs are laid without warning and nearly always at night after a great deal of futile endeavour chance at last favoured me on the 5th of september one of my guests fecundated on the 29th of august began to make her preparations under my eyes at four oclock in the afternoon one remark before proceeding all the nests i have obtained in the laboratoryand i have obtained a good numberhave without exception been built upon the wire gauze of the covers i have been careful to provide the insects with roughened stones and tufts of thyme both being very commonly used as foundations in the open fields the captives have always preferred the network of wire gauze which affords a perfectly firm foundation as the soft material of the nest becomes incrusted upon the meshes as it hardens in natural conditions the nests are never in any way sheltered they support the inclemencies of winter resist rain wind frost and snow without becoming detached it is true that the female always selects an uneven support on which the foundations of the nest can be shaped thus obtaining a firm hold the site chosen is always the best obtainable within reach and the wire gauze is constantly adopted as the best foundation obtainable in the cages the only mantis that i was able to observe at the moment of laying her eggs worked upsidedown clinging to the wire near the top of the cover my presence my magnifyingglass my investigations did not disturb her in the least so absorbed was she in her labours i was able to lift up the dome of wire gauze tilt it reverse it turn it over and reverse it again without causing the insect to delay her task for a moment i was able with my tweezers to raise the long wings in order to observe rather more closely what was taking place beneath them the mantis took absolutely no notice of me so far all was well the female did not move and lent herself impassively to all the indiscretions of the observer nevertheless matters did not proceed as i had wished so rapid was the operation and so difficult observation the end of the abdomen is constantly immersed in a blob of foam which does not allow one to grasp the details of the process very clearly this foam is of a greyish white slightly viscous and almost like soapsuds at the moment of its appearance it adheres slightly to the end of a straw plunged into it two minutes later it is solidified and no longer adheres to the straw in a short time its consistency is that of the substance of an old nest illustration 1 the mantis devouring the male in the act of mating 2 the mantis completing her nest 3 golden scarabi cutting up a lobworm the foamy mass consists chiefly of air imprisoned in minute bubbles this air which gives the nest a volume very much greater than that of the abdomen of the mantis evidently does not issue from the insect although the foam appears at the orifice of the genital organs it is borrowed from the atmosphere the mantis builds more especially with air which is eminently adapted to protect the nest against changes of temperature she emits a glutinous substance like the liquid secretion of silkworms and with this composition mixed instantaneously with the outer air she produces the foam of which the nest is constructed she whips the secretion as we whip white of egg in order to make it rise and stiffen the extremity of the abdomen opens in a long cleft forming two lateral ladles which open and shut with a rapid incessant movement beating the viscous liquid and converting it into foam as it is secreted beside the two oscillating ladles we see the internal organs rising and falling protruding and retreating like a pistonrod but it is impossible to observe the precise nature of their action bathed as they are in the opaque blob of foam the end of the abdomen continually palpitating rapidly closing and opening its valves oscillates right and left like a pendulum from each of these oscillations results a layer of eggs in the interior and a transversal crevice on the exterior as it advances in the arc described suddenly and at frequent intervals it plunges deeper into the foam as though burying something at the bottom of the frothy mass each time it does so an egg is doubtless deposited but the operation is so rapid and takes place under conditions so unfavourable for observation that i have never once been enabled to see the oviduct at work i can only judge of the advent of the eggs by the movements of the end of the abdomen which is immersed more deeply with a sudden plunging movement at the same time the viscous composition is emitted in intermittent waves and is beaten into a foam by the terminal valves the foam thus obtained spreads itself over the sides and at the base of the layer of eggs and projects through the meshes of the wire gauze as a result of the pressure of the abdomen thus the spongy envelope is progressively created as the ovaries are gradually emptied i imagine although i cannot speak as the result of direct observation that for the central core where the eggs are surrounded by a material more homogeneous than that of the outer shell the mantis must employ her secretion as it emerges without beating it into a foam the layer of eggs once deposited the two valves would produce the foam required to envelop the eggs it is extremely difficult however to guess what occurs beneath the veil of foamlike secretion in a recent nest the zone of issue is surrounded by a layer of finely porous matter of a pure matt almost chalky white which contrasts distinctly with the remainder of the nest which is of a dirty white it resembles the icing composition made by confectioners with whipped white of egg sugar and starch for the ornamentation of cakes this snowy border is easily crumbled and easily detached when it disappears the zone of issue is clearly defined with its double series of leaves with free edges exposure to the weather wind and rain result in its disappearance fragment by fragment so that old nests preserve no trace of it at first sight one is tempted to regard this snowy substance as of a different material to the rest of the nest but does the mantis really employ two secretions no anatomy in the first place assures us of the unity of the materials of the nest the organ which secretes the substance of the nest consists of cylindrical tubes having a curious tangled appearance which are arranged in two groups of twenty each they are all filled with a colourless viscous fluid which is precisely similar in appearance in all parts of the organ there is no indication of any organ or secretion which could produce a chalky coloration moreover the method by which the snowy band is formed rejects the idea of a different material we see the two caudal appendices of the mantis sweeping the surface of the foamy mass and skimming so to speak the cream of the cream gathering it together and retaining it along the hump of the nest in such a way as to form a band like a ribbon of icing what remains after this scouring process or what oozes from the band before it has set spreads over the sides of the nest in a thin layer of bubbles so fine that they cannot be distinguished without the aid of a lens we often see a torrent of muddy water full of clay in suspension covered with great streaks and masses of foam on this fundamental foam so to call it which is soiled with earthy matters we see here and there masses of a beautiful white foam in which the bubbles are much smaller a process of selection results from variations in density and here and there we see foam white as snow resting on the dirty foam from which it is produced something of the kind occurs when the mantis builds her nest the two appendices whip the viscous secretion of the glands into foam the lightest portion whose bubbles are of the greatest tenuity which is white on account of its finer porosity rises to the surface where the caudal filaments sweep it up and gather it into the snowy ribbon which runs along the summit of the nest so far with a little patience observation is possible and yields a satisfactory result it becomes impossible in the matter of the complex central zone where the exits for the larv are contrived through the double series of overlapping leaves the little i have been able to learn amounts to this the end of the abdomen deeply cleft in a horizontal direction forms a kind of fork of which the upper extremity remains almost motionless while the lower continuously oscillates producing the foam and depositing the eggs the creation of the central zone is certainly the work of the upper extremity it is always to be seen in the continuation of this central zone in the midst of the fine white foam gathered up by the caudal filaments the latter delimit the zone one working on either side feeling the edges of the belt and apparently testing it and judging its progress these two filaments are like two long fingers of exquisite sensitiveness which direct the difficult operation but how are the two series of scales obtained and the fissures the gates of exit which they shelter i do not know i cannot even imagine i leave the end of the problem to others what a wonderful mechanism is this that has the power to emit and to form so quickly and methodically the horny medium of the central kernel the foam which forms the protective walls the white creamy foam of the ribbon which runs along the central zone the eggs and the fecundating liquid while at the same time it constructs the overlapping leaves the imbricated scales and the alternating series of open fissures we are lost in the face of such a wonder yet how easily the work is performed clinging to the wire gauze forming so to speak the axis of her nest the mantis barely moves she bestows not a glance on the marvel which is growing behind her her limbs are used only for support they take no part in the building of the nest the nest is built if we may say so automatically it is not the result of industry and the cunning of instinct it is a purely mechanical task which is conditioned by the implements by the organisation of the insect the nest complex though it is in structure results solely from the functioning of the organs as in our human industries a host of objects are mechanically fashioned whose perfection puts the dexterity of the fingers to shame from another point of view the nest of the mantis is even more remarkable it forms an excellent application of one of the most valuable lessons of physical science in the matter of the conservation of heat the mantis has outstripped humanity in her knowledge of thermic nonconductors or insulators the famous physicist rumford was responsible for a very pretty experiment designed to demonstrate the low conductivity of air where heat other than radiant heat is concerned the famous scientist surrounded a frozen cheese by a mass of foam consisting of wellbeaten eggs the whole was exposed to the heat of an oven in a few minutes a light omelette was obtained piping hot but the cheese in the centre was as cold as at the outset the air imprisoned in the bubbles of the surrounding froth accounts for the phenomenon extremely refractory to heat it had absorbed the heat of the oven and had prevented it from reaching the frozen substance in the centre of the omelette now what does the mantis do precisely what rumford did she whips her albumen to obtain a souffle a froth composed of myriads of tiny airbubbles which will protect the germs of life contained in the central core it is true that her aim is reversed the coagulated foam of the nest is a safeguard against cold not against heat but what will afford protection from the one will afford protection from the other so that rumford had he wished might equally well have maintained a hot body at a high temperature in a refrigerator rumford understood the athermic properties of a blanket of aircells thanks to the accumulated knowledge of his predecessors and his own studies and experiments how is it that the mantis for who knows how many ages has been able to outstrip our physicists in this problem in calorics how did she learn to surround her eggs with this mass of solidifying froth so that it was able although fixed to a bough or a stone without other shelter to brave with impunity the rigours of winter the other mantes found in my neighbourhood which are the only species of which i can speak with full knowledge employ or omit the envelope of solidifying froth accordingly as the eggs are or are not intended to survive the winter the little grey mantis ameles decolor which differs so widely from the praying mantis in that the wings of the female are almost completely absent builds a nest hardly as large as a cherrystone and covers it skilfully with a porous rind why this cellular envelope because the nest of the ameles like that of the praying mantis has to endure through the winter fixed to a stone or a twig and is thus exposed to the full severity of the dangerous season the empusa pauperata on the other hand one of the strangest of european insects builds a nest as small as that of the ameles although the insect itself is as large as the praying mantis this nest is quite a small structure composed of a small number of cells arranged side by side in three or four series sloping together at the neck here there is a complete absence of the porous envelope although the nest is exposed to the weather like the previous examples affixed to some twig or fragment of rock the lack of the insulating rind is a sign of different climatic conditions the eggs of the empusa hatch shortly after they are laid in warm and sunny weather not being exposed to the asperities of the winter they need no protection other than the thin eggcases themselves are these nice and reasonable precautions which rival the experiment of rumford a fortuitous resultone of the innumerable combinations which fall from the urn of chance if so let us not recoil before the absurd let us allow that the blindness of chance is gifted with marvellous foresight the praying mantis commences her nest at the blunter extremity and completes it at the pointed tail the latter is often prolonged in a sort of promontory in which the insect expends the last drop of glutinous liquid as she stretches herself after her task a sitting of two hours more or less without interruption is required for the total accomplishment of the work directly the period of labour is over the mother withdraws indifferent henceforth to her completed task i have watched her half expecting to see her return to discover some tenderness for the cradle of her family but no not a trace of maternal pleasure the work is done and concerns her no longer crickets approach one of them even squats upon the nest the mantis takes no notice of them they are peaceful intruders to be sure but even were they dangerous did they threaten to rifle the nest would she attack them and drive them away her impassive demeanour convinces me that she would not what is the nest to her she is no longer conscious of it i have spoken of the many embraces to which the praying mantis submits and of the tragic end of the male who is almost invariably devoured as though a lawful prey in the space of a fortnight i have known the same female to adventure upon matrimony no less than seven times each time the readily consoled widow devoured her mate such habits point to frequent laying and we find the appearance confirmed though not as a general rule some of my females gave me one nest only others two the second as capacious as the first the most fruitful of all produced three of these the two first were of normal dimensions while the third was about half the usual size from this we can reckon the productivity of the insects ovaries from the transverse fissures of the median zone of the nest it is easy to estimate the layers of eggs but these layers contain more or fewer eggs according to their position in the middle of the nest or near the ends the numbers contained by the widest and narrowest layers will give us an approximate average i find that a nest of fair size contains about four hundred eggs thus the maker of the three nests of which the last was half as large as the others produced no less than a thousand eggs eight hundred were deposited in the larger nests and two or three hundred in the smaller truly a fine family but a thought ungainly were it not that only a few of its members can survive of a fair size of curious structure and well in evidence on its twig or stone the nest of the praying mantis could hardly escape the attention of the provenal peasant it is well known in the country districts where it goes by the name of tigno it even enjoys a certain celebrity but no one seems to be aware of its origin it is always a surprise to my rustic neighbours when they learn that the wellknown tigno is the nest of the common mantis the prgodiu this ignorance may well proceed from the nocturnal habits of the mantis no one has caught the insect at work upon her nest in the silence of the night the link between the artificer and the work is missing although both are well known to the villager no matter the singular object exists it catches the eye it attracts attention it must therefore be good for something it must possess virtue of some kind so in all ages have the simple reasoned in the childlike hope of finding in the unfamiliar an alleviation of their sorrows by general agreement the rural pharmacopoeia of provence pronounces the tigno to be the best of remedies against chilblains the method of employment is of the simplest the nest is cut in two squeezed and the affected part is rubbed with the cut surface as the juices flow from it this specific i am told is sovereign all sufferers from blue and swollen fingers should without fail according to traditional usage have recourse to the tigno is it really efficacious despite the general belief i venture to doubt it after fruitless experiments on my own fingers and those of other members of my household during the winter of 1895 when the severe and persistent cold produced an abundant crop of chilblains none of us treated with the celebrated unguent observed the swelling to diminish none of us found that the pain and discomfort was in the least assuaged by the sticky varnish formed by the juices of the crushed tigno it is not easy to believe that others are more successful but the popular renown of the specific survives in spite of all probably thanks to a simple accident of identity between the name of the remedy and that of the infirmity the provenal for chilblain is tigno from the moment when the chilblain and the nest of the mantis were known by the same name were not the virtues of the latter obvious so are reputations created in my own village and doubtless to some extent throughout the midi the tignothe nest of the mantis not the chilblainis also reputed as a marvellous cure for toothache it is enough to carry it upon the person to be free of that lamentable affection women wise in such matters gather them beneath a propitious moon and preserve them piously in some corner of the clothespress or wardrobe they sew them in the lining of the pocket lest they should be pulled out with the handkerchief and lost they will grant the loan of them to a neighbour tormented by some refractory molar lend me thy tigno i am suffering martyrdom begs the owner of a swollen facedont on any account lose it says the lender i havent another and we arent at the right time of moon we will not laugh at the credulous victim many a remedy triumphantly puffed on the latter pages of the newspapers and magazines is no more effectual moreover this rural simplicity is surpassed by certain old books which form the tomb of the science of a past age an english naturalist of the sixteenth century the wellknown physician thomas moffat informs us that children lost in the country would inquire their way of the mantis the insect consulted would extend a limb indicating the direction to be taken and says the author scarcely ever was the insect mistaken this pretty story is told in latin with an adorable simplicity chapter viii the golden gardenerits nutriment in writing the first lines of this chapter i am reminded of the slaughterpens of chicago of those horrible meat factories which in the course of the year cut up one million and eighty thousand bullocks and seventeen hundred thousand swine which enter a train of machinery alive and issue transformed into cans of preserved meat sausages lard and rolled hams i am reminded of these establishments because the beetle i am about to speak of will show us a compatible celerity of butchery in a spacious glazed insectorium i have twentyfive carabi aurati at present they are motionless lying beneath a piece of board which i gave them for shelter their bellies cooled by the sand their backs warmed by the board which is visited by the sun they slumber and digest their food by good luck i chance upon a procession of pinecaterpillars in process of descending from their tree in search of a spot suitable for burial the prelude to the phase of the subterranean chrysalis here is an excellent flock for the slaughterhouse of the carabi i capture them and place them in the insectorium the procession is quickly reformed the caterpillars to the number of perhaps a hundred and fifty move forward in an undulating line they pass near the piece of board one following the other like the pigs at chicago the moment is propitious i cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war that is to say i remove the plank the sleepers immediately awake scenting the abundant prey one of them runs forward three four follow the whole assembly is aroused those who are buried emerge the whole band of cutthroats falls upon the passing flock it is a sight never to be forgotten the mandibles of the beetles are at work in all directions the procession is attacked in the van in the rear in the centre the victims are wounded on the back or the belly at random the furry skins are gaping with wounds their contents escape in knots of entrails bright green with their aliment the needles of the pinetree the caterpillars writhe struggling with looplike movements gripping the sand with their feet dribbling and gnashing their mandibles those as yet unwounded are digging desperately in the attempt to take refuge underground not one succeeds they are scarcely half buried before some beetle runs to them and destroys them by an eviscerating wound if this massacre did not occur in a dumb world we should hear all the horrible tumult of the slaughterhouses of chicago but only the ear of the mind can hear the shrieks and lamentations of the eviscerated victims for myself i possess this ear and am full of remorse for having provoked such sufferings now the beetles are rummaging in all directions through the heap of dead and dying each tugging and tearing at a morsel which he carries off to swallow in peace away from the inquisitive eyes of his fellows this mouthful disposed of another is hastily cut from the body of some victim and the process is repeated so long as there are bodies left in a few minutes the procession is reduced to a few shreds of still palpitating flesh there were a hundred and fifty caterpillars the butchers were twentyfive this amounts to six victims dispatched by each beetle if the insect had nothing to do but to kill like the knackers in the meat factories and if the staff numbered a hundreda very modest figure as compared with the staff of a lard or bacon factorythen the total number of victims in a day of ten hours would be thirtysix thousand no chicago cannery ever rivalled such a result the speed of assassination is the more remarkable when we consider the difficulties of attack the beetle has no endless chain to seize its victim by one leg hoist it up and swing it along to the butchers knife it has no sliding plank to hold the victims head beneath the poleaxe of the knacker it has to fall upon its prey overpower it and avoid its feet and its mandibles moreover the beetle eats its prey on the spot as it kills what slaughter there would be if the insect confined itself to killing what do we learn from the slaughterhouses of chicago and the fate of the beetles victims this that the man of elevated morality is so far a very rare exception under the skin of the civilised being there lurks almost always the ancestor the savage contemporary of the cavebear true humanity does not yet exist it is growing little by little created by the ferment of the centuries and the dictates of conscience but it progresses towards the highest with heartbreaking slowness it was only yesterday that slavery finally disappeared the basis of the ancient social organism only yesterday was it realised that man even though black is really man and deserves to be treated accordingly what formerly was woman she was what she is today in the east a gentle animal without a soul the question was long discussed by the learned the great divine of the seventeenth century bossuet himself regarded woman as the diminutive of man the proof was in the origin of eve she was the superfluous bone the thirteenth rib which adam possessed in the beginning it has at last been admitted that woman possesses a soul like our own but even superior in tenderness and devotion she has been allowed to educate herself which she has done at least as zealously as her coadjutor but the law that gloomy cavern which is still the lurkingplace of so many barbarities continues to regard her as an incapable and a minor the law in turn will finally surrender to the truth the abolition of slavery and the education of woman these are two enormous strides upon the path of moral progress our descendants will go farther they will see with a lucidity capable of piercing every obstacle that war is the most hopeless of all absurdities that our conquerors victors of battles and destroyers of nations are detestable scourges that a clasp of the hand is preferable to a rifleshot that the happiest people is not that which possesses the largest battalions but that which labours in peace and produces abundantly and that the amenities of existence do not necessitate the existence of frontiers beyond which we meet with all the annoyances of the customhouse with its officials who search our pockets and rifle our luggage our descendants will see this and many other marvels which today are extravagant dreams to what ideal height will the process of evolution lead mankind to no very magnificent height it is to be feared we are afflicted by an indelible taint a kind of original sin if we may call sin a state of things with which our will has nothing to do we are made after a certain pattern and we can do nothing to change ourselves we are marked with the mark of the beast the taint of the belly the inexhaustible source of bestiality the intestine rules the world in the midst of our most serious affairs there intrudes the imperious question of bread and butter so long as there are stomachs to digestand as yet we are unable to dispense with themwe must find the wherewithal to fill them and the powerful will live by the sufferings of the weak life is a void that only death can fill hence the endless butchery by which man nourishes himself no less than beetles and other creatures hence the perpetual holocausts which make of this earth a knackers yard beside which the slaughterhouses of chicago are as nothing but the feasters are legion and the feast is not abundant in proportion those that have not are envious of those that have the hungry bare their teeth at the satisfied then follows the battle for the right of possession man raises armies to defend his harvests his granaries and his cellars he resorts to warfare when shall we see the end of it alas and many times alas as long as there are wolves in the world there must be watchdogs to defend the flock this train of thought has led us far away from our beetles let us return to them what was my motive in provoking the massacre of this peaceful procession of caterpillars who were on the point of selfburial when i gave them over to the butchers was it to enjoy the spectacle of a frenzied massacre by no means i have always pitied the sufferings of animals and the smallest life is worthy of respect to overcome this pity there needed the exigencies of scientific researchexigencies which are often cruel in this case the subject of research was the habits of the carabus auratus the little verminkiller of our gardens who is therefore vulgarly known as the gardener beetle how far is this title deserved what game does the gardener beetle hunt from what vermin does he free our beds and borders his dealings with the procession of pinecaterpillars promise much let us continue our inquiry on various occasions about the end of april the gardens afford me the sight of such processions sometimes longer sometimes shorter i capture them and place them in the vivarium bloodshed commences the moment the banquet is served the caterpillars are eviscerated each by a single beetle or by several simultaneously in less than fifteen minutes the flock is completely exterminated nothing remains but a few shapeless fragments which are carried hither and thither to be consumed at leisure under the shelter of the wooden board one wellfed beetle decamps his booty in his jaws hoping to finish his feast in peace he is met by companions who are attracted by the morsel hanging from the mandibles of the fugitive and audaciously attempt to rob him first two then three they all endeavour to deprive the legitimate owner of his prize each seizes the fragment tugs at it commences to swallow it without further ado there is no actual battle no violent assaults as in the case of dogs disputing a bone their efforts are confined to the attempted theft if the legitimate owner retains his hold they consume his booty in common mandibles to mandibles until the fragment is torn or bitten through and each retires with his mouthful as i found to my cost in bygone experiments the pinecaterpillar wields a violently corrosive poison which produces a painful rash upon the hands it must therefore one would think form a somewhat highly seasoned diet the beetles however delight in it no matter how many flocks i provide them with they are all consumed but no one that i know of has ever found the golden gardener and its larva in the silken cocoons of the bombyx i do not expect ever to make such a discovery these cocoons are inhabited only in winter when the gardener is indifferent to food and lies torpid in the earth in april however when the processions of larv are seeking a suitable site for burial and metamorphosis the gardener should profit largely by its good fortune should it by any chance encounter them the furry nature of the victim does not in the least incommode the beetle but the hairiest of all our caterpillars the hedgehog caterpillar with its undulating mane partly red and partly black does seem to be too much for the beetle day after day it wanders about the vivarium in company with the assassins the latter apparently ignore its presence from time to time one of them will halt stroll round the hairy creature examine it and try to penetrate the tangled fleece immediately repulsed by the long dense palisade of hairs he retires without inflicting a wound and the caterpillar proceeds upon its way with undulating mane in pride and security but this state of things cannot last in a hungry moment emboldened moreover by the presence of his fellows the cowardly creature decides upon a serious attack there are four of them they industriously attack the caterpillar which finally succumbs assaulted before and behind it is eviscerated and swallowed as greedily as though it were a defenceless grub according to the hazard of discovery i provision my menagerie with various caterpillars some smooth and others hairy all are accepted with the utmost eagerness so long as they are of average size as compared with the beetles themselves if too small they are despised as they would not yield a sufficient mouthful if they are too large the beetle is unable to handle them the caterpillars of the sphinx moth and the great peacock moth for example would fall an easy prey to the beetle were it not that at the first bite of the assailant the intended victim by a contortion of its powerful flanks sends the former flying after several attacks all of which end by the beetle being flung back to some considerable distance the insect regretfully abandons his prey i have kept two strong and lively caterpillars for a fortnight in the cage of my golden beetles and nothing more serious occurred the trick of the suddenly extended posterior was too much for the ferocious mandibles the chief utility of the golden gardener lies in its extermination of all caterpillars that are not too powerful to attack it has one limitation however it is not a climber it hunts on the ground never in the foliage overhead i have never seen it exploring the twigs of even the smallest of bushes when caged it pays no attention to the most enticing caterpillars if the latter take refuge in a tuft of thyme at a few inches above the ground this is a great pity if only the beetle could climb how rapidly three or four would rid our cabbages of that grievous pest the larva of the white cabbage butterfly alas the best have always some failing some vice to exterminate caterpillars that is the true vocation of the golden gardener it is annoying that it can give us but little or no assistance in ridding us of another plague of the kitchengarden the snail the slime of the snail is offensive to the beetle it is safe from the latter unless crippled half crushed or projecting from the shell its relatives however do not share this dislike the horny procrustes the great scarabicus entirely black and larger than the carabus attacks the snail most valiantly and empties its shell to the bottom in spite of the desperate secretion of slime it is a pity that the procrustes is not more frequently found in our gardens it would be an excellent gardeners assistant chapter ix the golden gardenercourtship it is generally recognized that the carabus auratus is an active exterminator of caterpillars on this account in particular it deserves its title of gardener beetle it is the vigilant policeman of our kitchengardens our flowerbeds and herbaceous borders if my inquiries add nothing to its established reputation in this respect they will nevertheless in the following pages show the insect in a light as yet unsuspected the ferocious beast of prey the ogre who devours all creatures that are not too strong for him is himself killed and eaten by his fellows and by many others standing one day in the shadow of the planetrees that grow before my door i see a golden gardener go by as if on pressing business the pilgrim is well met he will go to swell the contents of my vivarium in capturing him i notice that the extremities of the wingcovers are slightly damaged is this the result of a struggle between rivals there is nothing to tell me the essential thing is that the insect should not be handicapped by any serious injury inspected and found to be without any serious wound and fit for service it is introduced into the glass dwelling of its twentyfive future companions next day i look for the new inmate it is dead its comrades have attacked it during the night and have cleaned out its abdomen insufficiently protected by the damaged wingcovers the operation has been performed very cleanly without any dismemberment claws head corselet all are correctly in place the abdomen only has a gaping wound through which its contents have been removed what remains is a kind of golden shell formed of the two conjoined elytra the shell of an oyster emptied of its inmate is not more empty this result astonishes me for i have taken good care that the cage should never be long without food the snail the pinecockchafer the praying mantis the lobworm the caterpillar and other favourite insects have all been given in alternation and in sufficient quantities in devouring a brother whose damaged armour lent itself to any easy attack my beetles had not the excuse of hunger is it their custom to kill the wounded and to eviscerate such of their fellows as suffer damage pity is unknown among insects at the sight of the desperate struggles of a crippled fellowcreature none of the same family will cry a halt none will attempt to come to its aid among the carnivorous insects the matter may develop to a tragic termination with them the passersby will often run to the cripple but do they do so in order to help it by no means merely to taste its flesh and if they find it agreeable to perform the most radical cure of its ills by devouring it it is possible therefore that the gardener with the injured wingcovers had tempted his fellows by the sight of his imperfectly covered back they saw in their defenceless comrade a permissible subject for dissection but do they respect one another when there is no previous wound at first there was every appearance that their relations were perfectly pacific during their sanguinary meals there is never a scuffle between the feasters nothing but mere mouthtomouth thefts there are no quarrels during the long siestas in the shelter of the board half buried in the cool earth my twentyfive subjects slumber and digest their food in peace they lie sociably near one another each in his little trench if i raise the plank they awake and are off running hither and thither constantly encountering one another without hostilities the profoundest peace is reigning and to all appearances will last for ever when in the early days of june i find a dead gardener its limbs are intact it is reduced to the condition of a mere golden husk like the defenceless beetle i have already spoken of it is as empty as an oystershell let us examine the remains all is intact save the huge breach in the abdomen so the insect was sound and unhurt when the others attacked it a few days pass and another gardener is killed and dealt with as before with no disorder in the component pieces of its armour let us place the dead insect on its belly it is to all appearances untouched place it on its back it is hollow and has no trace of flesh left beneath its carapace a little later and i find another empty relic then another and yet another until the population of my menagerie is rapidly shrinking if this insensate massacre continues i shall soon find my cage depopulated are my beetles hoary with age do they die a natural death and do the survivors then clean out the bodies or is the population being reduced at the expense of sound and healthy insects it is not easy to elucidate the matter since the atrocities are commonly perpetrated in the night but finally with vigilance on two occasions i surprise the beetles at their work in the light of day towards the middle of june a female attacks a male before my eyes the male is recognisable by his slightly smaller size the operation commences raising the ends of the wingcovers the assailant seizes her victim by the extremity of the abdomen from the dorsal side she pulls at him furiously eagerly munching with her mandibles the victim who is in the prime of life does not defend himself nor turn upon his assailant he pulls his hardest in the opposite direction to free himself from those terrible fangs he advances and recoils as he is overpowered by or overpowers the assassin and there his resistance ends the struggle lasts a quarter of an hour other beetles passing by call a halt and seem to say my turn next finally redoubling his efforts the male frees himself and flies if he had not succeeded in escaping the ferocious female would undoubtedly have eviscerated him illustration the golden gardener the mating season over the males are eviscerated by the females a few days later i witness a similar scene but this time the tragedy is played to the end once more it is a female who seizes a male from behind with no other protest except his futile efforts to escape the victim is forced to submit the skin finally yields the wound enlarges and the viscera are removed and devoured by the matron who empties the carapace her head buried in the body of her late companion the legs of the miserable victim tremble announcing the end the murderess takes no notice she continues to rummage as far as she can reach for the narrowing of the thorax nothing is left but the closed boatshaped wingcovers and the fore parts of the body the empty shell is left lying on the scene of the tragedy in this way must have perished the beetlesalways maleswhose remains i find in the cage from time to time thus the survivors also will perish between the middle of june and the 1st of august the inhabitants of the cage twentyfive in number at the outset are reduced to five all of whom are females all the males to the number of twenty have disappeared eviscerated and completely emptied and by whom apparently by the females that this is the case is attested in the first place by the two assaults of which i was perchance the witness on two occasions in broad daylight i saw the female devouring the male having opened the abdomen under the wingcovers or having at least attempted to do so as for the rest of the massacres although direct observation was lacking i had one very valuable piece of evidence as we have seen the victim does not retaliate does not defend himself but simply tries to escape by pulling himself away if it were a matter of an ordinary fight a conflict such as might arise in the struggle for life the creature attacked would obviously retaliate since he is perfectly well able to do so in an ordinary conflict he would meet force by force and return bite for bite his strength would enable him to come well out of a struggle but the foolish creature allows himself to be devoured without retaliating it seems as though an invincible repugnance prevents him from offering resistance and in turn devouring the devourer this tolerance reminds one of the scorpion of languedoc which on the termination of the hymeneal rites allows the female to devour him without attempting to employ his weapon the venomous dagger which would form a formidable defence it reminds us also of the male of the praying mantis which still embraces the female though reduced to a headless trunk while the latter devours him by small mouthfuls with no rebellion or defence on his part there are other examples of hymeneal rites to which the male offers no resistance the males of my menagerie of gardeners one and all eviscerated speak of similar customs they are the victims of the females when the latter have no further use for them for four months from april to august the insects pair off continually sometimes tentatively but usually the mating is effective the business of mating is all but endless for these fiery spirits the gardener is prompt and businesslike in his affairs of the heart in the midst of the crowd with no preliminary courtship the male throws himself upon the female the female thus embraced raises her head a trifle as a sign of acquiescence while the cavalier beats the back of her neck with his antenn the embrace is brief and they abruptly separate after a little refreshment the two parties are ready for other adventures and yet others so long as there are males available after the feast a brief and primitive wooing after the wooing the feast in such delights the life of the gardener passes the females of my collection were in no proper ratio to the number of aspiring lovers there were five females to twenty males no matter there was no rivalry no hustling all went peacefully and sooner or later each was satisfied i should have preferred a better proportioned assembly chance not choice had given me that at my disposal in the early spring i had collected all the gardeners i could find under the stones of the neighbourhood without distinguishing the sexes for they are not easy to recognise merely by external characteristics later on i learned by watching them that a slight excess of size was the distinctive sign of the female my menagerie so illproportioned in the matter of sex was therefore the result of chance i do not suppose this preponderance of males exists in natural conditions on the other hand one never sees such numerous groups at liberty in the shelter of the same stone the gardener lives an almost solitary life it is rarely that one finds two or three beneath the same object of shelter the gathering in my menagerie was thus exceptional although it did not lead to confusion there is plenty of room in the glass cage for excursions to a distance and for all their habitual manoeuvres those who wish for solitude can obtain it those who wish for company need not seek it for the rest captivity cannot lie heavily on them that is proved by their frequent feasts their constant mating they could not thrive better in the open perhaps not so well for food is less abundant under natural conditions in the matter of wellbeing the prisoners are in a normal condition favourable to the maintenance of their usual habits it is true that encounters of beetle with beetle are more frequent here than in the open hence no doubt arise more opportunities for the females to persecute the males whom they no longer require to fall upon them from the rear and eviscerate them this pursuit of their onetime lovers is aggravated by their confined quarters but it certainly is not caused thereby for such customs are not suddenly originated the mating season over the female encountering a male in the open must evidently regard him as fair game and devour him as the termination of the matrimonial rites i have turned over many stones but have never chanced upon this spectacle but what has occurred in my menagerie is sufficient to convince me what a world these beetles live in where the matron devours her mate so soon as her fertility delivers her from the need of him and how lightly the males must be regarded by custom to be served in this manner is this practice of postmatrimonial cannibalism a general custom in the insect world for the moment i can recollect only three characteristic examples those of the praying mantis the golden gardener and the scorpion of languedoc an analogous yet less brutal practicefor the victim is defunct before he is eatenis a characteristic of the locust family the female of the whitefaced decticus will eagerly devour the body of her dead mate as will the green grasshopper to a certain extent this custom is excused by the nature of the insects diet the decticus and the grasshopper are essentially carnivorous encountering a dead body of their own species a female will devour it even if it be the body of her latest mate but what are we to say in palliation of the vegetarians at the approach of the breeding season before the eggs are laid the ephippigera turns upon her still living mate disembowels him and eats as much of him as her appetite will allow the cheerful cricket shows herself in a new light at this season she attacks the mate who lately wooed her with such impassioned serenades she tears his wings breaks his musical thighs and even swallows a few mouthfuls of the instrumentalist it is probable that this deadly aversion of the female for the male at the end of the mating season is fairly common especially among the carnivorous insects but what is the object of this atrocious custom that is a question i shall not fail to answer when circumstances permit chapter x the fieldcricket the breeding of crickets demands no particular preparations a little patience is enoughpatience which according to buffon is genius but which i more modestly will call the superlative virtue of the observer in april may or later we may establish isolated couples in ordinary flowerpots containing a layer of beaten earth their diet will consist of a leaf of lettuce renewed from time to time the pot must be covered with a square of glass to prevent the escape of the inmates i have gathered some very curious data from these makeshift appliances which may be used with and as a substitute for the cages of wire gauze although the latter are preferable we shall return to the point presently for the moment let us watch the process of breeding taking care that the critical hour does not escape us it was during the first week of june that my assiduous visits were at last repaid i surprised the female motionless with the oviduct planted vertically in the soil heedless of the indiscreet visitor she remained for a long time stationed at the same point finally she withdrew her oviduct and effaced though without particular care the traces of the hole in which her eggs were deposited rested for a moment walked away and repeated the operation not once but many times first here then there all over the area at her disposal her behaviour was precisely the same as that of the decticus except that her movements were more deliberate at the end of twentyfour hours her eggs were apparently all laid for greater certainty i waited a couple of days longer i then examined the earth in the pot the eggs of a strawyellow are cylindrical in form with rounded ends and measure about onetenth of an inch in length they are placed singly in the soil in a perpendicular position i have found them over the whole area of the pot at a depth of a twelfth of an inch as closely as the difficulties of the operation will allow i have estimated the eggs of a single female upon passing the earth through a sieve at five or six hundred such a family will certainly undergo an energetic pruning before very long the egg of the cricket is a curiosity a tiny mechanical marvel after hatching it appears as a sheath of opaque white open at the summit where there is a round and very regular aperture to the edge of which adheres a little valve like a skullcap which forms the lid instead of breaking at random under the thrusts or the cuts of the newformed larva it opens of itself along a line of least resistance which occurs expressly for the purpose the curious process of the actual hatching should be observed a fortnight after the egg is laid two large eyemarks round and of a reddish black are seen to darken the forward extremity of the egg next a little above these two points and right at the end of the cylinder a tiny circular capsule or swelling is seen this marks the line of rupture which is now preparing presently the translucency of the egg allows us to observe the fine segmentation of the tiny inmate now is the moment to redouble our vigilance and to multiply our visits especially during the earlier part of the day fortune favours the patient and rewards my assiduity round the little capsule changes of infinite delicacy have prepared the line of least resistance the end of the egg pushed by the head of the inmate becomes detached rises and falls aside like the top of a tiny phial the cricket issues like a jackinthebox when the cricket has departed the shell remains distended smooth intact of the purest white with the circular lid hanging to the mouth of the door of exit the egg of the bird breaks clumsily under the blows of a wartlike excrescence which is formed expressly upon the beak of the unborn bird the egg of the cricket of a far superior structure opens like an ivory casket the pressure of the inmates head is sufficient to work the hinge the moment he is deprived of his white tunic the young cricket pale all over almost white begins to struggle against the overlying soil he strikes it with his mandibles he sweeps it aside kicking it backwards and downwards and being of a powdery quality which offers no particular resistance he soon arrives at the surface and henceforth knows the joys of the sun and the perils of intercourse with the living a tiny feeble creature little larger than a flea his colour deepens in twentyfour hours he assumes a splendid ebony black which rivals that of the adult insect of his original pallor he retains only a white girdle which encircles the thorax and reminds one of the leadingstring of an infant very much on the alert he sounds his surroundings with his long vibrating antenn he toddles and leaps along with a vigour which his future obesity will no longer permit this is the age of stomach troubles what are we to give him to eat i do not know i offer him adult dietthe tender leaves of a lettuce he disdains to bite it or perhaps his bites escape me so tiny would they be in a few days what with my ten households i see myself loaded with family cares what shall i do with my five or six thousand crickets an attractive flock to be sure but one i cannot bring up in my ignorance of the treatment required i will give you liberty gentle creatures i will confide you to the sovereign nurse and schoolmistress nature it is done here and there about my orchard in the most favourable localities i loose my legions what a concert i shall have before my door next year if all goes well but no there will probably be silence for the terrible extermination will follow which corresponds with the fertility of the mother a few couples only may survive that is the most we can hope the first to come to the living feast and the most eager at the slaughter are the little grey lizard and the ant i am afraid this latter hateful filibuster that it is will not leave me a single cricket in my garden it falls upon the tiny crickets eviscerates them and devours them with frantic greed satanic creature and to think that we place it in the front rank of the insect world the books celebrate its virtues and never tire of its praises the naturalists hold it in high esteem and add to its reputation daily so true is it of animals as of man that of the various means of living in history the most certain is to do harm to others every one knows the bousier dungbeetle and the necrophorus those lively murderers the gnat the drinker of blood the wasp the irascible bully with the poisoned dagger and the ant the maleficent creature which in the villages of the south of france saps and imperils the rafters and ceilings of a dwelling with the same energy it brings to the eating of a fig i need say no more human history is full of similar examples of the useful misunderstood and undervalued and the calamitous glorified what with the ants and other exterminating forces the massacre was so great that the colonies of crickets in my orchard so numerous at the outset were so far decimated that i could not continue my observations but had to resort to the outside world for further information in august among the detritus of decaying leaves in little oases whose turf is not burned by the sun i find the young cricket has already grown to a considerable size he is all black like the adult without a vestige of the white cincture of the early days he has no domicile the shelter of a dead leaf the cover afforded by a flat stone is sufficient he is a nomad and careless where he takes his repose illustration 1 the fieldcricket a duel between rivals 2 the fieldcricket the defeated rival retires insulted by the victor not until the end of october when the first frosts are at hand does the work of burrowing commence the operation is very simple as far as i can tell from what i have learned from the insect in captivity the burrow is never made at a bare or conspicuous point it is always commenced under the shelter of a faded leaf of lettuce the remains of the food provided this takes the place of the curtain of grass so necessary to preserve the mysterious privacy of the establishment the little miner scratches with his foreclaws but also makes use of the pincers of his mandibles in order to remove pieces of grit or gravel of any size i see him stamping with his powerful hinder limbs which are provided with a double row of spines i see him raking and sweeping backwards the excavated material and spreading it out in an inclined plane this is his whole method at first the work goes forward merrily the excavator disappears under the easily excavated soil of his prison after two hours labour at intervals he returns to the orifice always tail first and always raking and sweeping if fatigue overcomes him he rests on the threshold of his burrow his head projecting outwards his antenn gently vibrating presently he reenters his tunnel and sets to work again with his pincers and rakes presently his periods of repose grow longer and tire my patience the most important part of the work is now completed once the burrow has attained a depth of a couple of inches it forms a sufficient shelter for the needs of the moment the rest will be the work of time a labour resumed at will for a short time daily the burrow will be made deeper and wider as the growth of the inmate and the inclemency of the season demand even in winter if the weather is mild and the sun smiles upon the threshold of his dwelling one may sometimes surprise the cricket thrusting out small quantities of loosened earth a sign of enlargement and of further burrowing in the midst of the joys of spring the cares of the house still continue it is constantly restored and perfected until the death of the occupant april comes to an end and the song of the cricket commences at first we hear only timid and occasional solos but very soon there is a general symphony when every scrap of turf has its performer i am inclined to place the cricket at the head of the choristers of spring in the waste lands of provence when the thyme and the lavender are in flower the cricket mingles his note with that of the crested lark which ascends like a lyrical firework its throat swelling with music to its invisible station in the clouds whence it pours its liquid arias upon the plain below from the ground the chorus of the crickets replies it is monotonous and artless yet how well it harmonises in its very simplicity with the rustic gaiety of a world renewed it is the hosanna of the awakening the alleluia of the germinating seed and the sprouting blade to which of the two performers should the palm be given i should award it to the cricket he triumphs by force of numbers and his neverceasing note the lark hushes her song that the bluegrey fields of lavender swinging their aromatic censers before the sun may hear the cricket alone at his humble solemn celebration but here the anatomist intervenes roughly demanding of the cricket show me your instrument the source of your music like all things of real value it is very simple it is based on the same principle as that of the locusts there is the toothed fiddlestick and the vibrating tympanum the right wingcover overlaps the left and almost completely covers it except for the sudden fold which encases the insects flank this arrangement is the reverse of that exhibited by the green grasshopper the decticus the ephippigera and their relations the cricket is righthanded the others lefthanded the two wingcovers have the same structure to know one is to know the other let us examine that on the right hand it is almost flat on the back but suddenly folds over at the side the turn being almost at right angles this lateral fold encloses the flank of the abdomen and is covered with fine oblique and parallel nervures the powerful nervures of the dorsal portion of the wingcover are of the deepest black and their general effect is that of a complicated design not unlike a tangle of arabic caligraphy seen by transmitted light the wingcover is of a very pale reddish colour excepting two large adjacent spaces one of which the larger and anterior is triangular in shape while the other the smaller and posterior is oval each space is surrounded by a strong nervure and goffered by slight wrinkles or depressions these two spaces represent the mirror of the locust tribe they constitute the sonorous area the substance of the wingcover is finer here than elsewhere and shows traces of iridescent though somewhat smoky colour these are parts of an admirable instrument greatly superior to that of the decticus the five hundred prisms of the bow biting upon the ridges of the wingcover opposed to it set all four tympanums vibrating at once the lower pair by direct friction the upper pair by the vibration of the wingcover itself what a powerful sound results the decticus endowed with only one indifferent mirror can be heard only at a few paces the cricket the possessor of four vibratory areas can be heard at a hundred yards the cricket rivals the cigale in loudness but his note has not the displeasing raucous quality of the latter better still he has the gift of expression for he can sing loud or soft the wingcovers as we have seen are prolonged in a deep fold over each flank these folds are the dampers which as they are pressed downwards or slightly raised modify the intensity of the sound and according to the extent of their contact with the soft abdomen now muffle the song to a mezza voce and now let it sound fortissimo peace reigns in the cage until the warlike instinct of the mating period breaks out these duels between rivals are frequent and lively but not very serious the two rivals rise up against one another biting at one anothers headsthese solid fangproof helmetsroll each other over pick themselves up and separate the vanquished cricket scuttles off as fast as he can the victor insults him by a couple of triumphant and boastful chirps then moderating his tone he tacks and veers about the desired one the lover proceeds to make himself smart hooking one of his antenn towards him with one of his free claws he takes it between his mandibles in order to curl it and moisten it with saliva with his long hind legs spurred and laced with red he stamps with impatience and kicks out at nothing emotion renders him silent his wingcovers are nevertheless in rapid motion but are no longer sounding or at most emit but an unrhythmical rubbing sound presumptuous declaration the female cricket does not run to hide herself in the folds of her lettuce leaves but she lifts the curtain a little and looks out and wishes to be seen et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videri she flies towards the brake but hopes first to be perceived said the poet of the delightful eclogue two thousand years ago sacred provocations of lovers are they not in all ages the same chapter xi the italian cricket my house shelters no specimens of the domestic cricket the guest of bakeries and rustic hearths but although in my village the chinks under the hearthstones are mute the nights of summer are musical with a singer little known in the north the sunny hours of spring have their singer the fieldcricket of which i have written while in the summer during the stillness of the night we hear the note of the italian cricket the oecanthus pellucens scop one diurnal and one nocturnal between them they share the kindly half of the year when the fieldcricket ceases to sing it is not long before the other begins its serenade the italian cricket has not the black costume and heavy shape characteristic of the family it is on the contrary a slender weakly creature its colour very pale indeed almost white as is natural in view of its nocturnal habits in handling it one is afraid of crushing it between the fingers it lives an aerial existence on shrubs and bushes of all kinds on tall herbage and grasses and rarely descends to the earth its song the pleasant voice of the calm hot evenings from july to october commences at sunset and continues for the greater part of the night this song is familiar to all provenals for the least patch of thicket or tuft of grasses has its group of instrumentalists it resounds even in the granaries into which the insect strays attracted thither by the fodder but no one so mysterious are the manners of the pallid cricket knows exactly what is the source of the serenade which is often though quite erroneously attributed to the common fieldcricket which at this period is silent and as yet quite young the song consists of a griii griii a slow gentle note rendered more expressive by a slight tremor hearing it one divines the extreme tenuity and the amplitude of the vibrating membranes if the insect is not in any way disturbed as it sits in the low foliage the note does not vary but at the least noise the performer becomes a ventriloquist first of all you hear it there close by in front of you and the next moment you hear it over there twenty yards away the double note decreased in volume by the distance you go forward nothing is there the sound proceeds again from its original point but noit is not there it is to the left nowunless it is to the rightor behind complete confusion it is impossible to detect by means of the ear the direction from which the chirp really comes much patience and many precautions will be required before you can capture the insect by the light of the lantern a few specimens caught under these conditions and placed in a cage have taught me the little i know concerning the musician who so perfectly deceives our ears the wingcovers are both formed of a dry broad membrane diaphanous and as fine as the white skin on the outside of an onion which is capable of vibrating over its whole area their shape is that of the segment of a circle cut away at the upper end this segment is bent at a right angle along a strong longitudinal nervure and descends on the outer side in a flap which encloses the insects flank when in the attitude of repose the right wingcover overlaps the left its inner edge carries on the under side near the base a callosity from which five radiating nervures proceed two of them upwards and two downwards while the fifth runs approximately at right angles to these this last nervure which is of a slightly reddish hue is the fundamental element of the musical device it is in short the bow the fiddlestick as is proved by the fine notches which run across it the rest of the wingcover shows a few more nervures of less importance which hold the membrane stretched tight but do not form part of the friction apparatus the left or lower wingcover is of similar structure with the difference that the bow the callosity and the nervures occupy the upper face it will be found that the two bowsthat is the toothed or indented nervurescross one another obliquely when the note has its full volume the wingcovers are well raised above the body like a wide gauzy sail only touching along the internal edges the two bows the toothed nervures engage obliquely one with the other and their mutual friction causes the sonorous vibration of the two stretched membranes illustration the italian cricket the sound can be modified accordingly as the strokes of each bow bear upon the callosity which is itself serrated or wrinkled or on one of the four smooth radiating nervures thus in part are explained the illusions produced by a sound which seems to come first from one point then from another when the timid insect is alarmed the production of loud or soft resounding or muffled notes which gives the illusion of distance the principal element in the art of the ventriloquist has another and easily discovered source to produce the loud open sounds the wingcovers are fully lifted to produce the muted muffled notes they are lowered when lowered their outer edges press more or less lightly on the soft flanks of the insect thus diminishing the vibratory area and damping the sound the gentle touch of a fingertip muffles the sharp loud ringing of a glass tumbler or musicalglass and changes it into a veiled indefinite sound which seems to come from a distance the white cricket knows this secret of acoustics it misleads those that seek it by pressing the edge of its vibrating membranes to the soft flesh of its abdomen our musical instruments have their dampers that of the oecanthus pellucens rivals and surpasses them in simplicity of means and perfection of results the fieldcricket and its relatives also vary the volume of their song by raising or lowering the elytra so as to enclose the abdomen in a varying degree but none of them can obtain by this method results so deceptive as those produced by the italian cricket to this illusion of distance which is a source of perpetually renewed surprise evoked by the slightest sound of our footsteps we must add the purity of the sound and its soft tremolo i know of no insect voice more gracious more limpid in the profound peace of the nights of august how many times per amica silentia lun have i lain upon the ground in the shelter of a clump of rosemary to listen to the delicious concert the nocturnal cricket sings continually in the gardens each tuft of the redflowered cistus has its band of musicians and each bush of fragrant lavender the shrubs and the terebinthtrees contain their orchestras with its clear sweet voice all this tiny world is questioning replying from bush to bush from tree to tree or rather indifferent to the songs of others each little being is singing his joys to himself alone above my head the constellation of cygnus stretches its great cross along the milky way below all around me palpitates the insect symphony the atom telling of its joys makes me forget the spectacle of the stars we know nothing of these celestial eyes which gaze upon us cold and calm with scintillations like the blinking of eyelids science tells us of their distance their speeds their masses their volumes it burdens us with stupendous numbers and stupefies us with immensities but it does not succeed in moving us and why because it lacks the great secret the secret of life what is there up there what do these suns warm worlds analogous to ours says reason planets on which life is evolving in an endless variety of forms a superb conception of the universe but after all a pure conception not based upon patent facts and infallible testimony at the disposal of one and all the probable even the extremely probable is not the obvious the evident which forces itself irresistibly and leaves no room for doubt but in your company o my crickets i feel the thrill of life the soul of our native lump of earth and for this reason as i lean against the hedge of rosemary i bestow only an absent glance upon the constellation of cygnus but give all my attention to your serenade a little animated slime capable of pleasure and pain surpasses in interest the universe of dead matter chapter xii the sisyphus beetlethe instinct of paternity the duties of paternity are seldom imposed on any but the higher animals they are most notable in the bird and the furry peoples acquit themselves honourably lower in the scale we find in the father a general indifference as to the fate of the family very few insects form exceptions to this rule although all are imbued with a mating instinct that is almost frenzied nearly all when the passion of the moment is appeased terminate then and there their domestic relations and withdraw indifferent to the brood which has to look after itself as best it may this paternal coldness which would be odious in the higher walks of animal life where the weakness of the young demands prolonged assistance has in the insect world the excuse that the newborn young are comparatively robust and are able without help to fill their mouths and stomachs provided they find themselves in propitious surroundings all that the prosperity of the race demands of the pierides or cabbage butterflies is that they should deposit their eggs on the leaves of the cabbage what purpose would be served by the instincts of a father the botanical instinct of the mother needs no assistance at the period of laying the father would be in the way let him pursue his flirtations elsewhere the laying of eggs is a serious business in the case of the majority of insects the process of education is unknown or summary in the extreme the insect has only to select a grazingground upon which its family will establish itself the moment it is hatched or a site which will allow the young to find their proper sustenance for themselves there is no need of a father in these various cases after mating the discarded male who is henceforth useless drags out a lingering existence of a few days and finally perishes without having given the slightest assistance in the work of installing his offspring but matters are not everywhere so primitive as this there are tribes in which an inheritance is prepared for the family which will assure it both of food and of shelter in advance the hymenoptera in particular are pastmasters in the provision of cellars jars and other utensils in which the honeypaste destined for the young is stored they are perfect in the art of excavating storehouses of food for their grubs this stupendous labour of construction and provisioning this labour that absorbs the insects whole life is the work of the mother only who wears herself out at her task the father intoxicated with sunlight lies idle on the threshold of the workshop watching the heroic female at her work and regards himself as excused from all labour when he has plagued his neighbours a little does he never perform useful work why does he not follow the example of the swallows each of whom brings a fair share of the straw and mortar for the building of the nest and the midges for the young brood no he does nothing perhaps alleging the excuse of his relative weakness but this is a poor excuse for to cut out little circles from a leaf to rake a little cotton from a downy plant or to gather a little mortar from a muddy spot would hardly be a task beyond his powers he might very well collaborate at least as labourer he could at least gather together the materials for the more intelligent mother to place in position the true motive of his idleness is ineptitude it is a curious thing that the hymenoptera the most skilful of all industrial insects know nothing of paternal labour the male of the genus in whom we should expect the requirements of the young to develop the highest aptitudes is as useless as a butterfly whose family costs so little to establish the actual distribution of instinct upsets our most reasonable previsions it upsets our expectations so completely that we are surprised to find in the dungbeetle the noble prerogative which is lacking in the bee tribe the mates of several species of dungbeetle keep house together and know the worth of mutual labour consider the male and female geotrupes which prepare together the patrimony of their larv in their case the father assists his companion with the pressure of his robust body in the manufacture of their balls of compressed nutriment these domestic habits are astonishing amidst the general isolation to this example hitherto unique my continual researches in this direction permit me today to add three others which are fully as interesting all three are members of the corporation of dungbeetles i will relate their habits but briefly as in many respects their history is the same as that of the sacred scarabus the spanish copris and others the first example is the sisyphus beetle sisyphus schfferi lin the smallest and most industrious of our pillmakers it has no equal in lively agility grotesque somersaults and sudden tumbles down the impossible paths or over the impracticable obstacles to which its obstinacy is perpetually leading it in allusion to these frantic gymnastics latreille has given the insect the name of sisyphus after the celebrated inmate of the classic hades this unhappy spirit underwent terrible exertions in his efforts to heave to the top of a mountain an enormous rock which always escaped him at the moment of attaining the summit and rolled back to the foot of the slope begin again poor sisyphus begin again begin again always your torments will never cease until the rock is firmly placed upon the summit of the mountain i like this myth it is in a way the history of many of us not odious scoundrels worthy of eternal torments but worthy and laborious folk useful to their neighbours one crime alone is theirs to expiate the crime of poverty half a century or more ago for my own part i left many bloodstained tatters on the crags of the inhospitable mountain i sweated strained every nerve exhausted my veins spent without reckoning my reserves of energy in order to carry upward and lodge in a place of security that crushing burden my daily bread and hardly was the load balanced but it once more slipped downwards fell and was engulfed begin again poor sisyphus begin again until your burden falling for the last time shall crush your head and set you free at length the sisyphus of the naturalists knows nothing of these tribulations agile and lively careless of slope or precipice he trundles his load which is sometimes food for himself sometimes for his offspring he is very rare hereabouts i should never have succeeded in obtaining a sufficient number of specimens for my purpose but for an assistant whom i may opportunely present to the reader for he will be mentioned again in these recitals this is my son little paul aged seven an assiduous companion of the chase he knows better than any one of his age the secrets of the cigale the cricket and especially of the dungbeetle his great delight at a distance of twenty yards his clear sight distinguishes the refusetip of a beetles burrow from a chance lump of earth his fine ear will catch the chirping of a grasshopper inaudible to me he lends me his sight and hearing and i in return make him free of my thoughts which he welcomes attentively raising his wide blue eyes questioningly to mine what an adorable thing is the first blossoming of the intellect best of all ages is that when the candid curiosity awakens and commences to acquire knowledge of every kind little paul has his own insectorium in which the scarabus makes his balls his garden the size of a handkerchief in which he grows haricot beans which are often dug up to see if the little roots are growing longer his plantation containing four oaktrees an inch in height to which the acorns still adhere these serve as diversions after the arid study of grammar which goes forward none the worse on that account what beautiful and useful knowledge the teaching of natural history might put into childish heads if only science would consider the very young if our barracks of universities would only combine the lifeless study of books with the living study of the fields if only the red tape of the curriculum so dear to bureaucrats would not strangle all willing initiative little paul and i will study as much as possible in the open country among the rosemary bushes and arbutus there we shall gain vigour of body and of mind we shall find the true and the beautiful better than in schoolbooks today the blackboard has a rest it is a holiday we rise early in view of the intended expedition so early that we must set out fasting but no matter when we are hungry we shall rest in the shade and you will find in my knapsack the usual viaticumapples and a crust of bread the month of may is near the sisyphus should have appeared now we must explore at the foot of the mountain the scanty pastures through which the herds have passed we must break with our fingers one by one the cakes of sheepdung dried by the sun but still retaining a spot of moisture in the centre there we shall find sisyphus cowering and waiting until the evening for fresher pasturage possessed of this secret which i learned from previous fortuitous discoveries little paul immediately becomes a master in the art of dislodging the beetle he shows such zeal has such an instinct for likely hidingplaces that after a brief search i am rich beyond my ambitions behold me the owner of six couples of sisyphus beetles an unheardof number which i had never hoped to obtain for their maintenance a wiregauze cover suffices with a bed of sand and diet to their taste they are very small scarcely larger than a cherrystone their shape is extremely curious the body is dumpy tapering to an acornshaped posterior the legs are very long resembling those of the spider when outspread the hinder legs are disproportionately long and curved being thus excellently adapted to enlace and press the little pilule of dung mating takes place towards the beginning of may on the surface of the soil among the remains of the sheepdung on which the beetles have been feeding soon the moment for establishing the family arrives with equal zeal the two partners take part in the kneading transport and baking of the food for their offspring with the filelike forelegs a morsel of convenient size is shaped from the piece of dung placed in the cage father and mother manipulate the piece together striking it blows with their claws compressing it and shaping it into a ball about the size of a big pea as in the case of the scarabus sacer the exact spherical form is produced without the mechanical device of rolling the ball before it is moved even before it is cut loose from its point of support the fragment is modelled into the shape of a sphere the beetle as geometer is aware of the form best adapted to the long preservation of preserved foods the ball is soon ready it must now be forced to acquire by means of a vigorous rolling the crust which will protect the interior from a too rapid evaporation the mother recognisable by her slightly robuster body takes the place of honour in front her long hinder legs on the soil her forelegs on the ball she drags it towards her as she walks backwards the father pushes behind moving tail first his head held low this is exactly the method of the scarabus beetles which also work in couples though for another object the sisyphus beetles harness themselves to provide an inheritance for their larv the larger insects are concerned in obtaining the material for a banquet which the two chancemet partners will consume underground the couple set off with no definite goal ahead across the irregularities of the soil which cannot be avoided by a leader who hauls backwards but even if the sisyphus saw the obstacles she would not try to evade them witness her obstinate endeavour to drag her load up the wire gauze of her cage a hopeless undertaking fixing her hinder claws in the meshes of the wire gauze the mother drags her burden towards her then enlacing it with her legs she holds it suspended the father finding no purchase for his legs clutches the ball grows on to it so to speak thus adding his weight to that of the burden and awaits events the effort is too great to last ball and beetle fall together the mother from above gazes a moment in surprise and suddenly lets herself fall only to reembrace the ball and recommence her impracticable efforts to scale the wall after many tumbles the attempt is at last abandoned even on level ground the task is not without its difficulties at every moment the load swerves on the summit of a pebble a fragment of gravel the team are overturned and lie on their backs kicking their legs in the air this is a mere nothing they pick themselves up and resume their positions always quick and lively the accidents which so often throw them on their backs seem to cause them no concern one would even think they were invited the pilule has to be matured given a proper consistency in these conditions falls shocks blows and jolts might well enter into the programme this mad trundling lasts for hours and hours finally the mother considering that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion departs in search of a favourable place for storage the father crouched upon the treasure waits if the absence of his companion is prolonged he amuses himself by rapidly whirling the pill between his hind legs which are raised in the air he juggles with the precious burden he tests its perfections between his curved legs calliperwise seeing him frisking in this joyful occupation who can doubt that he experiences all the satisfactions of a father assured of the future of his family it is i he seems to say it is i who have made this loaf so beautifully round it is i who have made the hard crust to preserve the soft dough it is i who have baked it for my sons and he raises on high in the sight of all this magnificent testimonial of his labours but now the mother has chosen the site a shallow pit is made the mere commencement of the projected burrow the ball is pushed and pulled until it is close at hand the father a vigilant watchman still retains his hold while the mother digs with claws and head soon the pit is deep enough to receive the ball she cannot dispense with the close contact of the sacred object she must feel it bobbing behind her against her back safe from all parasites and robbers before she can decide to burrow further she fears what might happen to the precious loaf if it were abandoned at the threshold of the burrow until the completion of the dwelling there is no lack of midges and tiny dungbeetlesaphodiinwhich might take possession of it it is only prudent to be distrustful so the ball is introduced into the pit half in and half out of the mouth of the burrow the mother below clasps and pulls the father above moderates the jolts and prevents it from rolling all goes well digging is resumed and the descent continues always with the same prudence one beetle dragging the load the other regulating its descent and clearing away all rubbish that might hinder the operation a few more efforts and the ball disappears underground with the two miners what follows will be for a time at least only a repetition of what we have seen let us wait half a day or so if our vigilance is not relaxed we shall see the father regain the surface alone and crouch in the sand near the mouth of the burrow retained by duties in the performance of which her companion can be of no assistance the mother habitually delays her reappearance until the following day when she finally emerges the father wakes up leaves his hiding place and rejoins her the reunited couple return to their pasturage refresh themselves and then cut out another ball of dung as before both share the work the hewing and shaping the transport and the burial in ensilage this conjugal fidelity is delightful but is it really the rule i should not dare to affirm that it is there must be flighty individuals who in the confusion under a large cake of droppings forget the fair confectioners for whom they have worked as journeymen and devote themselves to the services of others encountered by chance there must be temporary unions and divorces after the burial of a single pellet no matter the little i myself have seen gives me a high opinion of the domestic morals of the sisyphus let us consider these domestic habits a little further before coming to the contents of the burrow the father works fully as hard as the mother at the extraction and modelling of the pellet which is destined to be the inheritance of a larva he shares in the work of transport even if he plays a secondary part he watches over the pellet when the mother is absent seeking for a suitable site for the excavation of the cellar he helps in the work of digging he carries away the rubbish from the burrow finally to crown all these qualities he is in a great measure faithful to his spouse the scarabus exhibits some of these characteristics he also assists his spouse in the preparation of pellets of dung he also assists her to transport the pellets the pair facing each other and the female going backwards but as i have stated already the motive of this mutual service is selfish the two partners labour only for their own good the feast is for themselves alone in the labours that concern the family the female scarabus receives no assistance alone she moulds her sphere extracts it from the lump and rolls it backwards with her back to her task in the position adopted by the male sisyphus alone she excavates her burrow and alone she buries the fruit of her labour oblivious of the gravid mother and the future brood the male gives her no assistance in her exhausting task how different to the little pelletmaker the sisyphus it is now time to visit the burrow at no very great depth we find a narrow chamber just large enough for the mother to move around at her work its very exiguity proves that the male cannot remain underground so soon as the chamber is ready he must retire in order to leave the female room to move we have in fact seen that he returns to the surface long before the female the contents of the cellar consist of a single pellet a masterpiece of plastic art it is a miniature reproduction of the pearshaped ball of the scarabus a reproduction whose very smallness gives an added value to the polish of the surface and the beauty of its curves its larger diameter varies from half to threequarters of an inch it is the most elegant product of the dungbeetles art but this perfection is of brief duration very soon the little pear becomes covered with gnarled excrescences black and twisted which disfigure it like so many warts part of the surface which is otherwise intact disappears under a shapeless mass the origin of these knotted excrescences completely deceived me at first i suspected some cryptogamic vegetation some spherica for example recognisable by its black knotted incrusted growth it was the larva that showed me my mistake the larva is a maggot curved like a hook carrying on its back an ample pouch or hunch forming part of its alimentary canal the reserve of excreta in this hunch enables it to seal accidental perforations of the shell of its lodging with an instantaneous jet of mortar these sudden emissions like little wormcasts are also practised by the scarabus but the latter rarely makes use of them the larv of the various dungbeetles utilise their alimentary residues in roughcasting their houses which by their dimensions lend themselves to this method of disposal while evading the necessity of opening temporary windows by which the ordure can be expelled whether for lack of sufficient room or for other reasons which escape me the larva of the sisyphus having employed a certain amount in the smoothing of the interior ejects the rest of its digestive products from its dwelling let us examine one of these pears when the inmate is already partly grown sooner or later we shall see a spot of moisture appear at some point on the surface the wall softens becomes thinner and then through the softened shell a jet of dark green excreta rises and falls back upon itself in corkscrew convolutions one excrescence the more has been formed as it dries it becomes black what has occurred the larva has opened a temporary breach in the wall of its shell and through this orifice in which a slight thickness of the outer glaze still remains it has expelled the excess of mortar which it could not employ within this practice of forming oubliettes in the shell of its prison does not endanger the grub as they are immediately closed and hermetically sealed by the base of the jet which is compressed as by a stroke of a trowel the stopper is so quickly put in place that the contents remain moist in spite of the frequent breaches made in the shell of the pear there is no danger of an influx of the dry outer air the sisyphus seems to be aware of the peril which later on in the dogdays will threaten its pear small as it is and so near the surface of the ground it is extremely precocious it labours in april and may when the air is mild in the first fortnight of july before the terrible dogdays have arrived the members of its family break their shells and set forth in search of the heap of droppings which will furnish them with food and lodging during the fierce days of summer then come the short but pleasant days of autumn the retreat underground and the winter torpor the awakening of spring and finally the cycle is closed by the festival of pelletmaking one word more as to the fertility of the sisyphus my six couples under the wiregauze cover furnished me with fiftyseven inhabited pellets this gives an average of more than nine to each couple a figure which the scarabus sacer is far from attaining to what should we attribute this superior fertility i can only see one cause the fact that the male works as valiantly as the female family cares too great for the strength of one are not too heavy when there are two to support them chapter xiii a beehunter the philanthus aviporus to encounter among the hymenoptera those ardent lovers of flowers a species which goes ahunting on its own account is to say the least of it astonishing that the larder of the larv should be provisioned with captured prey is natural enough but that the provider whose diet is honey should itself devour its captives is a fact both unexpected and difficult to comprehend we are surprised that a drinker of nectar should become a drinker of blood but our surprise abates if we consider the matter closely the double diet is more apparent than real the stomach which fills itself with the nectar of flowers does not gorge itself with flesh when she perforates the rump of her victim the odynerus does not touch the flesh which is a diet absolutely contrary to her tastes she confines herself to drinking the defensive liquid which the grub distils at the end of its intestine for her this liquid is doubtless a beverage of delicious flavour with which she relieves from time to time her staple diet of the honey distilled by flowers some highly spiced condiment appetiser or aperient or perhapswho knowsa substitute for honey although the qualities of the liquid escape me i see at least that odynerus cares nothing for the rest once the pouch is emptied the larva is abandoned as useless offal a certain sign of noncarnivorous appetites under these conditions the persecutor of chrysomela can no longer be regarded as guilty of an unnatural double dietary we may even wonder whether other species also are not apt to draw some direct profit from the hunting imposed upon them by the needs of the family the procedure of odynerus in opening the anal pouch is so far removed from the usual that we should not anticipate many imitators it is a secondary detail and impracticable with game of a different kind but there may well be a certain amount of variety in the means of direct utilisation why for example when the victim which has just been paralysed or rendered insensible by stinging contains in the stomach a delicious meal semiliquid or liquid in consistency should the hunter scruple to rob the halfliving body and force it to disgorge without injuring the quality of its flesh there may well be robbers of the moribund attracted not by their flesh but by the appetising contents of their stomachs as a matter of fact there are such and they are numerous in the first rank we may cite that hunter of the domestic bee philanthus aviporus latreille for a long time i suspected philanthus of committing such acts of brigandage for her own benefit having many times surprised her gluttonously licking the honeysmeared mouth of the bee i suspected that her hunting of the bee was not undertaken entirely for the benefit of her larv the suspicion was worth experimental confirmation at the time i was interested in another question also i wanted to study absolutely at leisure the methods by which the various predatory species dealt with their victims in the case of philanthus i made use of the improvised cage already described and philanthus it was who furnished me with my first data on the subject she responded to my hopes with such energy that i thought myself in possession of an unequalled method of observation by means of which i could witness again and again to satiety even incidents of a kind so difficult to surprise in a state of nature alas the early days of my acquaintance with philanthus promised me more than the future had in store for me not to anticipate however let us place under the bellglass the hunter and the game i recommend the experiment to whomsoever would witness the perfection with which the predatory hymenoptera use their stings the result is not in doubt and the waiting is short the moment the prey is perceived in an attitude favourable to her designs the bandit rushes at it and all is over in detail the tragedy develops as follows i place under a bellglass a philanthus and two or three domestic bees the prisoners climb the glass walls on the more strongly lighted side they ascend descend and seek to escape the polished vertical surface is for them quite easy to walk upon they presently quiet down and the brigand begins to notice her surroundings the antenn point forward seeking information the hinder legs are drawn up with a slight trembling as of greed and rapacity in the thighs the head turns to the right and the left and follows the evolutions of the bees against the glass the posture of the scoundrelly insect is strikingly expressive one reads in it the brutal desires of a creature in ambush the cunning patience that postpones attack the choice is made and philanthus throws herself upon her victim turn by turn tumbled and tumbling the two insects roll over and over but the struggle soon quiets down and the assassin commences to plunder her prize i have seen her adopt two methods in the first more usual than the other the bee is lying on the ground upon its back and philanthus mouth to mouth and abdomen to abdomen clasps it with her six legs while she seizes its neck in her mandibles the abdomen is then curved forward and gropes for a moment for the desired spot in the upper part of the thorax which it finally reaches the sting plunges into the victim remains in the wound for a moment and all is over without loosing the victim which is still tightly clasped the murderer restores her abdomen to the normal position and holds it pressed against that of the bee by the second method philanthus operates standing upright resting on the hinder feet and the extremity of the folded wings she rises proudly to a vertical position holding the bee facing her by her four anterior claws in order to get the bee into the proper position for the final stroke she swings the poor creature round and back again with the careless roughness of a child dandling a doll her pose is magnificent solidly based upon her sustaining tripod the two posterior thighs and the end of the wings she flexes the abdomen forwards and upwards and as before stings the bee in the upper part of the thorax the originality of her pose at the moment of striking surpasses anything i have ever witnessed the love of knowledge in matters of natural history is not without its cruelties to make absolutely certain of the point attained by the sting and to inform myself completely concerning this horrible talent for murder i have provoked i dare not confess how many assassinations in captivity without a single exception the bee has always been stung in the throat in the preparations for the final blow the extremity of the abdomen may of course touch here and there at different points of the thorax or abdomen but it never remains there nor is the sting unsheathed as may easily be seen once the struggle has commenced the philanthus is so absorbed in her operations that i can remove the glass cover and follow every detail of the drama with my magnifyingglass the invariable situation of the wound being proved i bend back the head of the bee so as to open the articulation i see under what we may call the chin of the bee a white spot hardly a twentyfifth of an inch square where the horny integuments are lacking and the fine skin is exposed uncovered it is there always there in that tiny defect in the bees armour that the sting is inserted why is this point attacked rather than another is it the only point that is vulnerable stretch open the articulation of the corselet to the rear of the first pair of legs there you will see an area of defenceless skin fully as delicate as that of the throat but much more extensive the horny armour of the bee has no larger breach if the philanthus were guided solely by considerations of vulnerability she would certainly strike there instead of insistently seeking the narrow breach in the throat the sting would not grope or hesitate it would find its mark at the first attempt no the poisoned thrust is not conditioned by mechanical considerations the murderer disdains the wide breach in the corselet and prefers the lesser one beneath the chin for purely logical reasons which we will now attempt to elicit the moment the bee is stung i release it from the aggressor i am struck in the first place by the sudden inertia of the antenn and the various members of the mouth organs which continue to move for so long a time in the victims of most predatory creatures i see none of the indications with which my previous studies of paralysed victims have made me familiar the antenn slowly waving the mandibles opening and closing the palp trembling for days for weeks even for months the thighs tremble for a minute or two at most and the struggle is over henceforth there is complete immobility the significance of this sudden inertia is forced upon me the philanthus has stabbed the cervical ganglions hence the sudden immobility of all the organs of the head hence the real not the apparent death of the bee the philanthus does not paralyse merely but kills this is one step gained the murderer chooses the point below the chin as the point of attack in order to reach the principal centres of innervation the cephalic ganglions and thus to abolish life at a single blow the vital centres being poisoned immediate death must follow if the object of the philanthus were merely to cause paralysis she would plunge her sting into the defective corselet as does the cerceris in attacking the weevil whose armour is quite unlike the bees her aim is to kill outright as we shall presently see she wants a corpse not a paralytic we must admit that her technique is admirable our human murderers could do no better her posture of attack which is very different to that of the paralysers is infallibly fatal to the victim whether she delivers the attack in the erect position or prone she holds the bee before her head to head and thorax to thorax in this position it suffices to flex the abdomen in order to reach the joint of the neck and to plunge the sting obliquely upwards into the head of the captive if the bee were seized in the inverse position or if the sting were to go slightly astray the results would be totally different the sting penetrating the bee in a downward direction would poison the first thoracic ganglion and provoke a partial paralysis only what art to destroy a miserable bee in what fencingschool did the slayer learn that terrible upward thrust beneath the chin and as she has learned it how is it that her victim so learned in matters of architecture so conversant with the politics of socialism has so far learned nothing in her own defence as vigorous as the aggressor she also carries a rapier which is even more formidable and more painful in its resultsat all events when my finger is the victim for centuries and centuries philanthus has stored her cellars with the corpses of bees yet the innocent victim submits and the annual decimation of her race has not taught her how to deliver herself from the scourge by a welldirected thrust i am afraid i shall never succeed in understanding how it is that the assailant has acquired her genius for sudden murder while the assailed better armed and no less powerful uses her dagger at random and so far without effect if the one has learned something from the prolonged exercise of the attack then the other should also have learned something from the prolonged exercise of defence for attack and defence are of equal significance in the struggle for life among the theorists of our day is there any so farsighted as to be able to solve this enigma i will take this opportunity of presenting a second point which embarrasses me it is the carelessnessit is worse than thatthe imbecility of the bee in the presence of the philanthus one would naturally suppose that the persecuted insect gradually instructed by family misfortune would exhibit anxiety at the approach of the ravisher and would at least try to escape but in my bellglasses or wiregauze cages i see nothing of the kind once the first excitement due to imprisonment has passed the bee takes next to no notice of its terrible neighbour i have seen it side by side with philanthus on the same flower assassin and future victim were drinking from the same goblet i have seen it stupidly coming to inquire what the stranger might be as the latter crouched watching on the floor when the murderer springs it is usually upon some bee which passes before her and throws itself so to speak into her clutches either thoughtlessly or out of curiosity there is no frantic terror no sign of anxiety no tendency to escape how is it that the experience of centuries which is said to teach so much to the lower creatures has not taught the bee even the beginning of apine wisdom a deeprooted horror of the philanthus does the bee count upon its sting but the unhappy creature is no fencer it thrusts without method at random nevertheless let us watch it at the final and fatal moment when the ravisher brings her sting into play the bee also uses its sting and with fury i see the point thrusting now in this direction now in that but in empty air or grazing and slipping over the convexity of the murderers back which is violently flexed these blows have no serious results in the position assumed by the two as they struggle the abdomen of the philanthus is inside and that of the bee outside thus the sting of the latter has under its point only the dorsal face of the enemy which is convex and slippery and almost invulnerable so well is it armoured there is no breach there by which the sting might possibly enter and the operation takes place with the certainty of a skilful surgeon using the lancet despite the indignant protests of the patient the fatal stroke once delivered the murderer remains for some time on the body of the victim clasping it face to face for reasons that we must now consider it may be that the position is perilous for philanthus the posture of attack and selfprotection is abandoned and the ventral area more vulnerable than the back is exposed to the sting of the bee now the dead bee retains for some minutes the reflex use of the sting as i know to my cost for removing the bee too soon from the aggressor and handling it carelessly i have received a most effectual sting in her long embrace of the poisoned bee how does philanthus avoid this sting which does not willingly give up its life without vengeance are there not sometimes unexpected accidents perhaps here is a fact which encourages me in this belief i had placed under the bellglass at the same time four bees and as many eristales in order to judge of the entomological knowledge of philanthus as exemplified in the distinction of species reciprocal quarrels broke out among the heterogeneous group suddenly in the midst of the tumult the killer is killed who has struck the blow certainly not the turbulent but pacific eristales it was one of the bees which by chance had thrust truly in the mellay when and how i do not know this accident is unique in my experience but it throws a light upon the question the bee is capable of withstanding its adversary it can with a thrust of its envenomed needle kill the wouldbe killer that it does not defend itself more skilfully when it falls into the hands of its enemy is due to ignorance of fencing not to the weakness of the arm and here again arises more insistently than before the question i asked but now how is it that the philanthus has learned for purposes of attack what the bee has not learned for purposes of defence to this difficulty i see only one reply the one knows without having learned and the other does not know being incapable of learning let us now examine the motives which induce the philanthus to kill its bee instead of paralysing it the murder once committed it does not release its victim for a moment but holding it tightly clasped with its six legs pressed against its body it commences to ravage the corpse i see it with the utmost brutality rooting with its mandibles in the articulation of the neck and often also in the more ample articulation of the corselet behind the first pair of legs perfectly aware of the fine membrane in that part although it does not take advantage of the fact when employing its sting although this vulnerable point is the more accessible of the two breaches in the bees armour i see it squeezing the bees stomach compressing it with its own abdomen crushing it as in a vice the brutality of this manipulation is striking it shows that there is no more need of care and skill the bee is a corpse and a little extra pushing and squeezing will not deteriorate its quality as food provided there is no effusion of blood and however rough the treatment i have never been able to discover the slightest wound these various manipulations above all the compression of the throat lead to the desired result the honey in the stomach of the bee ascends to the mouth i see the drops of honey welling out lapped up by the glutton as soon as they appear the bandit greedily takes in its mouth the extended and sugared tongue of the dead insect then once more it presses the neck and the thorax and once more applies the pressure of its abdomen to the honeysac of the bee the honey oozes forth and is instantly licked up this odious meal at the expense of the corpse is taken in a truly sybaritic attitude the philanthus lies upon its side with the bee between its legs this atrocious meal lasts often half an hour and longer finally the exhausted corpse is abandoned regretfully it seems for from time to time i have seen the ogre return to the feast and repeat its manipulation of the body after taking a turn round the top of the bellglass the robber of the dead returns to the victim squeezes it once more and licks its mouth until the last trace of honey has disappeared the frantic passion of the philanthus for the honey of the bee is betrayed in another fashion when the first victim has been exhausted i have introduced a second bee which has been promptly stabbed under the chin and squeezed as before in order to extract its honey a third has suffered the same fate without appeasing the bandit i have offered a fourth a fifth all are accepted my notes record that a philanthus sacrificed six bees in succession before my eyes and emptied them all of honey in the approved manner the killing came to an end not because the glutton was satiated but because my functions as provider were becoming troublesome the dry month of august leaves but few insects in the flowerless garden six bees emptied of their honeywhat a gluttonous meal yet the famishing creature would doubtless have welcomed a copious addition thereto had i had the means of furnishing it we need not regret the failure of bees upon this occasion for what i have already written is sufficient testimony of the singular habits of this murderer of bees i am far from denying that the philanthus has honest methods of earning its living i see it among the flowers no less assiduous than the rest of the hymenoptera peacefully drinking from their cups of nectar the male indeed being stingless knows no other means of supporting himself the mothers without neglecting the flowers as a general thing live by brigandage as well it is said of the labba that pirate of the seas that it pounces upon seabirds as they rise from the waves with captured fish in their beaks with a blow of the beak delivered in the hollow of the stomach the aggressor forces the victim to drop its prey and promptly catches it as it falls the victim at least escapes with nothing worse than a blow at the base of the neck the philanthus less scrupulous falls upon the bee stabs it to death and makes it disgorge in order to nourish herself upon its honey nourish i say and i do not withdraw the expression to support my statement i have better reasons than those already presented in the cages in which various predatory hymenoptera whose warlike habits i am studying are confined waiting until i have procured the desired preynot always an easy proceedingi have planted a few heads of flowers and a couple of thistleheads sprinkled with drops of honey renewed at need on these my captives feed in the case of the philanthus the honeyed flowers although welcomed are not indispensable it is enough if from time to time i place in the cage a few living bees half a dozen a day is about the proper allowance with no other diet than the honey extracted from their victims i keep my specimens of philanthus for a fortnight and three weeks so much is plain in a state of freedom when occasion offers the philanthus must kill on her own account as she does in captivity the odynerus asks nothing of the chrysomela but a simple condiment the aromatic juice of the anal pouch the philanthus demands a full diet or at least a notable supplement thereto in the form of the contents of the stomach what a hecatomb of bees must not a colony of these pirates sacrifice for their personal consumption to say nothing of their stores of provisions i recommend the philanthus to the vengeance of apiarists for the moment we will not look further into the original causes of the crime let us consider matters as we know them with all their real or apparent atrocity in order to nourish herself the philanthus levies tribute upon the crop of the bee this being granted let us consider the method of the aggressor more closely she does not paralyse its captives according to the customary rites of the predatory insects she kills them why to the eyes of understanding the necessity of a sudden death is as clear as day without eviscerating the bee which would result in the deterioration of its flesh considered as food for the larv without having recourse to the bloody extirpation of the stomach the philanthus intends to obtain its honey by skilful manipulation by cunning massage she must somehow make the bee disgorge suppose the bee stung in the rear of the corselet and paralysed it is deprived of locomotion but not of vitality the digestive apparatus in particular retains in full or at least in part its normal energies as is proved by the frequent dejections of paralysed victims so long as the intestine is not emptied a fact notably exemplified by the victims of the sphex family helpless creatures which i have before now kept alive for forty days with the aid of a little sugared water well without therapeutic means without emetics or stomachpumps how is a stomach intact and in good order to be persuaded to yield up its contents that of the bee jealous of its treasure will lend itself to such treatment less readily than another paralysed the creature is inert but there are always internal energies and organic resistances which will not yield to the pressure of the manipulator in vain would the philanthus gnaw at the throat and squeeze the flanks the honey would not return to the mouth as long as a trace of life kept the stomach closed matters are different with a corpse the springs relax the muscles yield the resistance of the stomach ceases and the vessels containing the honey are emptied by the pressure of the thief we see therefore that the philanthus is obliged to inflict a sudden death which instantly destroys the contractile power of the organs where shall the deadly blow be delivered the slayer knows better than we when she pierces the victim beneath the chin through the narrow breach in the throat the cerebral ganglions are reached and immediate death ensues the examination of these acts of brigandage is not sufficient in view of my incorrigible habit of following every reply by another query until the granite wall of the unknowable rises before me although the philanthus is skilled in forcing the bee to disgorge in emptying the crop distended with honey this diabolical skill cannot be merely an alimentary resource above all when in common with other insects she has access to the refectory of the flowers i cannot regard her talents as inspired solely by the desire of a meal obtained by the labour of emptying the stomach of another insect something must surely escape us here the real reason for emptying the stomach perhaps a respectable reason is concealed by the horrors i have recorded what is it every one will understand the vagueness which fills the observers mind in respect of such a question as this the reader has the right to be doubtful i will spare him my suspicions my gropings for the truth and the checks encountered in the search and give him the results of my long inquiry everything has its appropriate and harmonious reason i am too fully persuaded of this to believe that the philanthus commits her profanation of corpses merely to satisfy her appetite what does the empty stomach mean may it notyesbut after all who knows well let us follow up the scent the first care of the mothers is the welfare of the family so far all we know of the philanthus concerns her talent for murder let us consider her as a mother we have seen her hunt on her own account let us now watch her hunt for her offspring for the race nothing is simpler than to distinguish between the two kinds of hunting when the insect wants a few good mouthfuls of honey and nothing else she abandons the bee contemptuously when she has emptied its stomach it is so much valueless waste which will shrivel where it lies and be dissected by ants if on the other hand she intends to place it in the larder as a provision for her larv she clasps it with her two intermediate legs and walking on the other four drags it to and fro along the edge of the bellglass in search of an exit so that she may fly off with her prey having recognised the circular wall as impassable she climbs its sides now holding the bee in her mandibles by the antenn clinging as she climbs to the vertical polished surface with all six feet she gains the summit of the glass stays for a little while in the flasklike cavity of the terminal button or handle returns to the ground and resumes her circuit of the glass and her climbing relinquishing the bee only after an obstinate attempt to escape with it the persistence with which the philanthus retains her clasp upon the encumbering burden shows plainly that the game would go straight to the larder were the insect at liberty those bees intended for the larv are stung under the chin like the others they are true corpses they are manipulated squeezed exhausted of their honey just as the others there is no difference in the method of capture nor in their aftertreatment as captivity might possibly result in a few anomalies of action i decided to inquire how matters went forward in the open in the neighbourhood of some colonies of philanthid i lay in wait watching for perhaps a longer time than the question justified as it was already settled by what occurred in captivity my scrupulous watching at various times was rewarded the majority of the hunters immediately entered their nests carrying the bees pressed against their bodies some halted on the neighbouring undergrowth and these i saw treating the bee in the usual manner and lapping the honey from its mouth after these preparations the corpse was placed in the larder all doubt was thus destroyed the bees provided for the larv are previously carefully emptied of their honey since we are dealing with the subject let us take the opportunity of inquiring into the customs of the philanthus in a state of freedom making use of her victims when absolutely lifeless so that they would putrefy in the course of a few days this hunter of bees cannot adopt the customs of certain insects which paralyse their prey and fill their cellars before laying an egg she must surely be obliged to follow the method of the bembex whose larva receives at intervals the necessary nourishment the amount increasing as the larva grows the facts confirm this deduction i spoke just now of the tediousness of my watching when watching the colonies of the philanthus it was perhaps even more tedious than when i was keeping an eye upon the bembex before the burrows of cerceris tuberculus and other devourers of the weevil and before that of the yellowwinged sphex the slayer of crickets there is plenty of distraction owing to the busy movements of the community the mothers have scarcely entered the nest before they are off again returning quickly with fresh prey only to set out once more the going and coming is almost continuous until the storehouse is full the burrows of the philanthus know nothing of such animation even in a populous colony in vain my vigils prolonged themselves into whole mornings or afternoons and only very rarely does the mother who has entered with a bee set forth upon a second expedition two captures by the same huntress is the most that i have seen in my long watches once the family is provided with sufficient food for the moment the mother postpones further hunting trips until hunting becomes necessary and busies herself with digging and burrowing in her underground dwelling little cells are excavated and i see the rubbish from them gradually pushed up to the surface with that exception there is no sign of activity it is as though the burrow were deserted to lay the nest bare is not easy the burrow penetrates to a depth of about three feet in a compact soil sometimes in a vertical sometimes in a horizontal direction the spade and pick wielded by hands more vigorous but less expert than my own are indispensable but the conduct of the excavation is anything but satisfactory at the extremity of the long galleryit seems as though the straw i use for sounding would never reach the endwe finally discover the cells eggshaped cavities with the longer axis horizontal their number and their mutual disposition escape me some already contain the cocoonslender and translucid like that of the cerceris and like it recalling the shape of certain homoeopathic phials with oval bodies surmounted by a tapering neck by the extremity of the neck which is blackened and hardened by the dejecta of the larv the cocoon is fixed to the end of the cell without any other support it reminds one of a short club planted by the end of the handle in a line with the horizontal axis of the cell other cells contain the larva in a stage more or less advanced the grub is eating the last victim proffered around it lie the remains of food already consumed others again show me a bee a single bee still intact and having an egg deposited on the underside of the thorax this bee represents the first instalment of rations others will follow as the grub matures my expectations are thus confirmed as with bembex slayer of diptera so philanthus killer of bees lays her egg upon the first body stored and completes at intervals the provisioning of the cells the problem of the dead bee is elucidated there remains the other problem of incomparable interestwhy before they are given over to the larv are the bees robbed of their honey i have said and i repeat that the killing and emptying of the bee cannot be explained solely by the gluttony of the philanthus to rob the worker of its booty is nothing such things are seen every day but to slaughter it in order to empty its stomachno gluttony cannot be the only motive and as the bees placed in the cells are squeezed dry no less than the others the idea occurs to me that as a beefsteak garnished with confitures is not to every ones taste so the bee sweetened with honey may well be distasteful or even harmful to the larv of the philanthus what would the grub do if replete with blood and flesh it were to find under its mandibles the honeybag of the beeif gnawing at random it were to open the bees stomach and so drench its game with syrup would it approve of the mixture would the little ogre pass without repugnance from the gamey flavour of a corpse to the scent of flowers to affirm or deny is useless we must see let us see i take the young larv of the philanthus already well matured but instead of serving them with the provisions buried in their cells i offer them game of my own catchingbees that have filled themselves with nectar among the rosemary bushes my bees killed by crushing the head are thankfully accepted and at first i see nothing to justify my suspicions then my nurslings languish show themselves disdainful of their food give a negligent bite here and there and finally one and all die beside their uncompleted meal all my attempts miscarry not once do i succeed in rearing my larv as far as the stage of spinning the cocoon yet i am no novice in my duties as drynurse how many pupils have passed through my hands and have reached the final stage in my old sardineboxes as well as in their native burrows i shall draw no conclusions from this check which my scruples may attribute to some unknown cause perhaps the atmosphere of my cabinet and the dryness of the sand serving them for a bed have been too much for my nurslings whose tender skins are used to the warm moisture of the subsoil let us try another method to decide positively whether honey is or is not repugnant to the grubs of the philanthus was hardly practicable by the method just explained the first meals consisted of flesh and after that nothing in particular occurred the honey is encountered later when the bee is largely consumed if hesitation and repugnance were manifested at this point they came too late to be conclusive the sickness of the larv might be due to other causes known or unknown we must offer honey at the very beginning before artificial rearing has spoilt the grubs appetite to offer pure honey would of course be useless no carnivorous creature would touch it even were it starving i must spread the honey on meat that is i must smear the dead bee with honey lightly varnishing it with a camelshair brush under these conditions the problem is solved with the first few mouthfuls the grub having bitten on the honeyed bee draws back as though disgusted hesitates for a long time then urged by hunger begins again tries first on one side then on another in the end it refuses to touch the bee again for a few days it pines upon its rations which are almost intact then dies as many as are subjected to the same treatment perish in the same way do they simply die of hunger in the presence of food which their appetites reject or are they poisoned by the small amount of honey absorbed at the first bites i cannot say but whether poisonous or merely repugnant the bee smeared with honey is always fatal to them a fact which explains more clearly than the unfavourable circumstances of the former experiment my lack of success with the freshly killed bees this refusal to touch honey whether poisonous or repugnant is connected with principles of alimentation too general to be a gastronomic peculiarity of the philanthus grub other carnivorous larvat least in the series of the hymenopteramust share it let us experiment the method need not be changed i exhume the larv when in a state of medium growth to avoid the vicissitudes of extreme youth i collect the bodies of the grubs and insects which form their natural diet and smear each body with honey in which condition i return them to the larv a distinction is apparent all the larv are not equally suited to my experiment those larv must be rejected which are nourished upon one single corpulent insect as is that of the scolia the grub attacks its prey at a determined point plunges its head and neck into the body of the insect skilfully divides the entrails in order to keep the remains fresh until its meal is ended and does not emerge from the opening until all is consumed but the empty skin to interrupt the larva with the object of smearing the interior of its prey with honey is doubly objectionable i might extinguish the lingering vitality which keeps putrefaction at bay in the victim and i might confuse the delicate art of the larva which might not be able to recover the lode at which it was working or to distinguish between those parts which are lawfully and properly eaten and those which must not be consumed until a later period as i have shown in a previous volume the grub of the scolia has taught me much in this respect the only larv acceptable for this experiment are those which are fed on a number of small insects which are attacked without any special art dismembered at random and quickly consumed among such larv i have experimented with those provided by chancethose of various bembeces fed on diptera those of the palaris whose diet consists of a large variety of hymenoptera those of the tachytus provided with young crickets those of the odynerus fed upon larv of the chrysomela those of the sanddwelling cerceris endowed with a hecatomb of weevils as will be seen both consumers and consumed offer plenty of variety well in every case their proper diet seasoned with honey is fatal whether poisoned or disgusted they all die in a few days a strange result honey the nectar of the flowers the sole diet of the apiary under its two forms and the sole nourishment of the predatory insect in its adult phase is for the larva of the same insect an object of insurmountable disgust and probably a poison the transfiguration of the chrysalis surprises me less than this inversion of the appetite what change occurs in the stomach of the insect that the adult should passionately seek that which the larva refuses under peril of death it is no question of organic debility unable to support a diet too substantial too hard or too highly spiced the grubs which consume the larva of the cetoni for example the rosechafers those which feed upon the leathery cricket and those whose diet is rich in nitrobenzine must assuredly have complacent gullets and adaptable stomachs yet these robust eaters die of hunger or poison for no greater cause than a drop of syrup the lightest diet imaginable adapted to the weakness of extreme youth and a delicacy to the adult what a gulf of obscurity in the stomach of a miserable worm these gastronomic experiments called for a counterproof the carnivorous grub is killed by honey is the honeyfed grub inversely killed by carnivorous diet here again we must make certain exceptions observe a certain choice as in the previous experiments it would obviously be courting a flat refusal to offer a heap of young crickets to the larv of the anthophorus and the osmia for example the honeyfed grub would not bite such food it would be absolutely useless to make such an experiment we must find the equivalent of the bee smeared with honey that is we must offer the larva its ordinary food with a mixture of animal matter added i shall experiment with albumen as provided by the egg of the hen albumen being an isomer of fibrine which is the principal element of all flesh diet osmia tricornis will lend itself to my experiment better than any other insect on account of its dry honey or beebread which is largely formed of flowery pollen i knead it with the albumen graduating the dose of the latter so that its weight largely exceeds that of the beebread thus i obtain pastes of various degrees of consistency but all firm enough to support the larva without danger of immersion with too fluid a mixture there would be a danger of death by drowning finally on each cake of albuminous paste i install a larva of medium growth this diet is not distasteful far from it the grubs attack it without hesitation and devour it with every appearance of a normal appetite matters could not go better if the food had not been modified according to my recipes all is eaten even the portions which i feared contained an excessive proportion of albumen moreovera matter of still greater importancethe larv of the osmia fed in this manner attain their normal growth and spin their cocoons from which adults issue in the following year despite the albuminous diet the cycle of evolution completes itself without mishap what are we to conclude from all this i confess i am embarrassed omne vivum ex ovo says the physiologist all animals are carnivorous in their first beginnings they are formed and nourished at the expense of the egg in which albumen predominates the highest the mammals adhere to this diet for a considerable time they live by the maternal milk rich in casein another isomer of albumen the gramnivorous nestling is fed first upon worms and grubs which are best adapted to the delicacy of its stomach many newly born creatures among the lower orders being immediately left to their own devices live on animal diet in this way the original method of alimentation is continuedthe method which builds flesh out of flesh and makes blood out of blood with no chemical processes but those of simple reconstruction in maturity when the stomach is more robust a vegetable diet may be adopted involving a more complex chemistry although the food itself is more easily obtained to milk succeeds fodder to the worm seeds and grain to the dead or paralysed insects of the natal burrow the nectar of flowers here is a partial explanation of the double system of the hymenoptera with their carnivorous larvthe system of dead or paralysed insects followed by honey but here the point of interrogation already encountered elsewhere erects itself once again why is the larva of the osmia which thrives upon albumen actually fed upon honey during its early life why is a vegetable diet the rule in the hives of bees from the very commencement when the other members of the same series live upon animal food if i were a transformist how i should delight in this question yes i should say yes by the fact of its germ every animal is originally carnivorous the insect in particular makes a beginning with albuminoid materials many larv adhere to the alimentation present in the egg as do many adult insects also but the struggle to fill the belly which is actually the struggle for life demands something better than the precarious chances of the chase man at first an eager hunter of game collected flocks and became a shepherd in order to profit by his possessions in time of dearth further progress inspired him to till the earth and sow a method which assured him of a certain living evolution from the defective to the mediocre and from the mediocre to the abundant has led to the resources of agriculture the lower animals have preceded us on the way of progress the ancestors of the philanthus in the remote ages of the lacustrian tertiary formations lived by capturing prey in both phasesboth as larv and as adults they hunted for their own benefit as well as for the family they did not confine themselves to emptying the stomach of the bee as do their descendants today they devoured the victim entire from beginning to end they remained carnivorous later there were fortunate innovators whose race supplanted the more conservative element who discovered an inexhaustible source of nourishment to be obtained without painful search or dangerous conflict the saccharine exudation of the flowers the wasteful system of living upon prey by no means favourable to large populations has been preserved for the feeble larv but the vigorous adult has abandoned it for an easier and more prosperous existence thus the philanthus of our own days was gradually developed thus was formed the double system of nourishment practised by the various predatory insects which we know the bee has done still better from the moment of leaving the egg it dispenses completely with chancewon aliments it has invented honey the food of its larv renouncing the chase for ever and becoming exclusively agricultural this insect has acquired a degree of moral and physical prosperity that the predatory species are far from sharing hence the flourishing colonies of the anthophor the osmi the eucer the halicti and other makers of honey while the hunters of prey work in isolation hence the societies in which the bee displays its admirable talents the supreme expression of instinct this is what i should say if i were a transformist all this is a chain of highly logical deductions and it hangs together with a certain air of reality such as we like to look for in a host of transformist arguments which are put forward as irrefutable well i make a present of my deductive theory to whosoever desires it and without the least regret i do not believe a single word of it and i confess my profound ignorance of the origin of the twofold system of diet one thing i do see more clearly after all my experiments and research the tactics of the philanthus as a witness of its ferocious feasting the true motive of which was unknown to me i treated it to all the unfavourable epithets i could think of called it assassin bandit pirate robber of the dead ignorance is always abusive the man who does not know is full of violent affirmations and malign interpretations undeceived by the facts i hasten to apologise and express my esteem for the philanthus in emptying the stomach of the bee the mother is performing the most praiseworthy of all duties she is guarding her family against poison if she sometimes kills on her own account and abandons the body after exhausting it of honey i dare not call her action a crime when the habit has once been formed of emptying the bees crop for the best of motives the temptation is great to do so with no other excuse than hunger moreoverwho can sayperhaps there is always some afterthought that the larv might profit by the sacrifice although not carried into effect the intention excuses the act i therefore withdraw my abusive epithets in order to express my admiration of the creatures maternal logic honey would be harmful to the grubs how does the mother know that honey in which she herself delights is noxious to her young to this question our knowledge has no reply but honey as we have seen would endanger the lives of the grubs the bees must therefore be emptied of honey before they are fed to them the process must be effected without wounding the victim for the larva must receive the latter fresh and moist and this would be impracticable if the insect were paralysed on account of the natural resistance of the organs the bee must therefore be killed outright instead of being paralysed otherwise the honey could not be removed instantaneous death can be assured only by a lesion of the primordial centre of life the sting must therefore pierce the cervical ganglions the centre of innervation upon which the rest of the organism is dependent this can only be reached in one way through the neck here it is that the sting will be inserted and here it is inserted in a breach in the armour no larger than a pins head suppress a single link of this closely knit chain and the philanthus reared upon the flesh of bees becomes an impossibility that honey is fatal to larv is a fact pregnant with consequences various predatory insects feed their young with honeymakers such to my knowledge are the philanthus coronatus fabr which stores its burrows with the large halictus the philanthus raptor lep which chases all the smaller halictus indifferently being itself a small insect the cerceris ornata fabr which also kills halictus and the polaris flavipes fabr which by a strange eclecticism fills its cells with specimens of most of the hymenoptera which are not beyond its powers what do these four huntresses and others of similar habits do with their victims when the crops of the latter are full of honey they must follow the example of the philanthus or their offspring would perish they must squeeze and manipulate the dead bee until it yields up its honey everything goes to prove as much but for the actual observation of what would be a notable proof of my theory i must trust to the future chapter xiv the great peacock or emperor moth it was a memorable night i will name it the night of the great peacock who does not know this superb moth the largest of all our european butterflies3 with its livery of chestnut velvet and its collar of white fur the greys and browns of the wings are crossed by a paler zigzag and bordered with smoky white and in the centre of each wing is a round spot a great eye with a black pupil and variegated iris resolving into concentric arcs of black white chestnut and purplish red not less remarkable is the caterpillar its colour is a vague yellow on the summit of thinly sown tubercles crowned with a palisade of black hairs are set pearls of a turquoiseblue the burly brown cocoon which is notable for its curious tunnel of exit like an eelpot is always found at the base of an old almondtree adhering to the bark the foliage of the same tree nourishes the caterpillar on the morning of the 6th of may a female emerged from her cocoon in my presence on my laboratory table i cloistered her immediately all damp with the moisture of metamorphosis in a cover of wire gauze i had no particular intentions regarding her i imprisoned her from mere habit the habit of an observer always on the alert for what may happen i was richly rewarded about nine oclock that evening when the household was going to bed there was a sudden hubbub in the room next to mine little paul half undressed was rushing to and fro running jumping stamping and overturning the chairs as if possessed i heard him call me come quick he shrieked come and see these butterflies big as birds the rooms full of them i ran there was that which justified the childs enthusiasm and his hardly hyperbolical exclamation it was an invasion of giant butterflies an invasion hitherto unexampled in our house four were already caught and placed in a birdcage othersnumbers of themwere flying across the ceiling this astonishing sight recalled the prisoner of the morning to my mind put on your togs kiddy i told my son put down your cage and come with me we shall see something worth seeing we had to go downstairs to reach my study which occupies the right wing of the house in the kitchen we met the servant she too was bewildered by the state of affairs she was pursuing the huge butterflies with her apron having taken them at first for bats it seemed as though the great peacock had taken possession of my whole house more or less what would it be upstairs where the prisoner was the cause of this invasion happily one of the two study windows had been left ajar the road was open illustration the great peacock or emperor moth candle in hand we entered the room what we saw is unforgettable with a soft flicflac the great nightmoths were flying round the wiregauze cover alighting taking flight returning mounting to the ceiling redescending they rushed at the candle and extinguished it with a flap of the wing they fluttered on our shoulders clung to our clothing grazed our faces my study had become a cave of a necromancer the darkness alive with creatures of the night little paul to reassure himself held my hand much tighter than usual how many were there about twenty to these add those which had strayed into the kitchen the nursery and other rooms in the house and the total must have been nearly forty it was a memorable sightthe night of the great peacock come from all points of the compass warned i know not how here were forty lovers eager to do homage to the maiden princess that morning born in the sacred precincts of my study for the time being i troubled the swarm of pretenders no further the flame of the candle endangered the visitors they threw themselves into it stupidly and singed themselves slightly on the morrow we could resume our study of them and make certain carefully devised experiments to clear the ground a little for what is to follow let me speak of what was repeated every night during the eight nights my observations lasted every night when it was quite dark between eight and ten oclock the butterflies arrived one by one the weather was stormy the sky heavily clouded the darkness was so profound that out of doors in the garden and away from the trees one could scarcely see ones hand before ones face in addition to such darkness as this there were certain difficulties of access the house is hidden by great planetrees an alley densely bordered with lilacs and rosetrees make a kind of outer vestibule to the entrance it is protected from the mistral by groups of pines and screens of cypress a thicket of evergreen shrubs forms a rampart at a few paces from the door it was across this maze of leafage and in absolute darkness that the butterflies had to find their way in order to attain the end of their pilgrimage under such conditions the screechowl would not dare to forsake its hollow in the olivetree the butterfly better endowed with its faceted eyes than the owl with its single pupils goes forward without hesitation and threads the obstacles without contact so well it directs its tortuous flight that in spite of all the obstacles to be evaded it arrives in a state of perfect freshness its great wings intact without the slightest flaw the darkness is light enough for the butterfly even if we suppose it to be sensitive to rays unknown to the ordinary retina this extraordinary sight could not be the sense that warns the butterfly at a distance and brings it hastening to the bride distance and the objects interposed make the suggestion absurd moreover apart from illusory refractions of which there is no question here the indications of light are precise one goes straight to the object seen but the butterfly was sometimes mistaken not in the general direction but concerning the precise position of the attractive object i have mentioned that the nursery on the other side of the house to my study which was the actual goal of the visitors was full of butterflies before a light was taken into it these were certainly incorrectly informed in the kitchen there was the same crowd of seekers gone astray but there the light of a lamp an irresistible attraction to nocturnal insects might have diverted the pilgrims let us consider only such areas as were in darkness there the pilgrims were numerous i found them almost everywhere in the neighbourhood of their goal when the captive was in my study the butterflies did not all enter by the open window the direct and easy way the captive being only a few yards from the window several penetrated the house downstairs wandered through the hall and reached the staircase which was barred at the top by a closed door these data show us that the visitors to the weddingfeast did not go straight to their goal as they would have done were they attracted by any kind of luminous radiations whether known or unknown to our physical science something other than radiant energy warned them at a distance led them to the neighbourhood of the precise spot and left the final discovery to be made after a vague and hesitating search the senses of hearing and smell warn us very much in this way they are not precise guides when we try to determine exactly the point of origin of a sound or smell what sense is it that informs this great butterfly of the whereabouts of his mate and leads him wandering through the night what organ does this sense affect one suspects the antenn in the male butterfly they actually seem to be sounding interrogating empty space with their long feathery plumes are these splendid plumes merely items of finery or do they really play a part in the perception of the effluvia which guide the lover it seemed easy on the occasion i spoke of to devise a conclusive experiment on the morrow of the invasion i found in my study eight of my nocturnal visitors they were perched motionless upon the crossmouldings of the second window which had remained closed the others having concluded their ballet by about ten oclock at night had left as they had entered by the other window which was left open night and day these eight persevering lovers were just what i required for my experiment with a sharp pair of scissors and without otherwise touching the butterflies i cut off their antenn near the base the victims barely noticed the operation none moved there was scarcely a flutter of the wings their condition was excellent the wound did not seem to be in the least serious they were not perturbed by physical suffering and would therefore be all the better adapted to my designs they passed the rest of the day in placid immobility on the crossbars of the window a few other arrangements were still to be made in particular it was necessary to change the scene not to leave the female under the eyes of the mutilated butterflies at the moment of resuming their nocturnal flight the difficulty of the search must not be lessened i therefore removed the cage and its captive and placed it under a porch on the other side of the house at a distance of some fifty paces from my study at nightfall i went for a last time to inspect my eight victims six had left by the open window two still remained but they had fallen on the floor and no longer had the strength to recover themselves if turned over on their backs they were exhausted dying do not accuse my surgery however such early decease was observed repeatedly with no intervention on my part six in better condition had departed would they return to the call that attracted them the night before deprived of their antenn would they be able to find the captive now placed at a considerable distance from her original position the cage was in darkness almost in the open air from time to time i visited it with a net and lantern the visitors were captured inspected and immediately released in a neighbouring room of which i closed the door this gradual elimination allowed me to count the visitors exactly without danger of counting the same butterfly more than once moreover the provisional prison large and bare in no wise harmed or endangered the prisoners they found a quiet retreat there and ample space similar precautions were taken during the rest of my experiments after halfpast ten no more arrived the reception was over total twentyfive males captured of which one only was deprived of its antenn so of the six operated on earlier in the day which were strong enough to leave my study and fly back to the fields only one had returned to the cage a poor result in which i could place no confidence as proving whether the antenn did or did not play a directing part it was necessary to begin again upon a larger scale next morning i visited the prisoners of the day before what i saw was not encouraging a large number were scattered on the ground almost inert taken between the fingers several of them gave scarcely a sign of life little was to be hoped from these it would seem still i determined to try perhaps they would regain their vigour at the lovers hour the twentyfour prisoners were all subjected to the amputation of their antenn the one operated on the day before was put aside as dying or nearly so finally the door of the prison was left open for the rest of the day those might leave who could those could join in the carnival who were able in order to put those that might leave the room to the test of a search the cage which they must otherwise have encountered at the threshold was again removed and placed in a room of the opposite wing on the ground floor there was of course free access to this room of the twentyfour lacking their antenn sixteen only left the room eight were powerless to do so they were dying of the sixteen how many returned to the cage that night not one my captives that night were only seven all newcomers all wearing antenn this result seemed to prove that the amputation of the antenn was a matter of serious significance but it would not do to conclude as yet one doubt remained a fine state i am in how shall i dare to appear before the other dogs said mouflard the puppy whose ears had been pitilessly docked had my butterflies apprehensions similar to master mouflards deprived of their beautiful plumes were they ashamed to appear in the midst of their rivals and to prefer their suits was it confusion on their part or want of guidance was it not rather exhaustion after an attempt exceeding the duration of an ephemeral passion experience would show me on the fourth night i took fourteen newcomers and set them apart as they came in a room in which they spent the night on the morrow profiting by their diurnal immobility i removed a little of the hair from the centre of the corselet or neck this slight tonsure did not inconvenience the insects so easily was the silky fur removed nor did it deprive them of any organ which might later on be necessary in the search for the female to them it was nothing for me it was the unmistakable sign of a repeated visit this time there were none incapable of flight at night the fourteen shavelings escaped into the open air the cage of course was again in a new place in two hours i captured twenty butterflies of whom two were tonsured no more as for those whose antenn i had amputated the night before not one reappeared their nuptial period was over of fourteen marked by the tonsure two only returned why did the other twelve fail to appear although furnished with their supposed guides their antenn to this i can see only one reply that the great peacock is promptly exhausted by the ardours of the mating season with a view to mating the sole end of its life the great moth is endowed with a marvellous prerogative it has the power to discover the object of its desire in spite of distance in spite of obstacles a few hours for two or three nights are given to its search its nuptial flights if it cannot profit by them all is ended the compass fails the lamp expires what profit could life hold henceforth stoically the creature withdraws into a corner and sleeps the last sleep the end of illusions and the end of suffering the great peacock exists as a butterfly only to perpetuate itself it knows nothing of food while so many others joyful banqueters fly from flower to flower unrolling their spiral trunks to plunge them into honeyed blossoms this incomparable ascetic completely freed from the servitude of the stomach has no means of restoring its strength its buccal members are mere vestiges useless simulacra not real organs able to perform their duties not a sip of honey can ever enter its stomach a magnificent prerogative if it is not long enjoyed if the lamp is to burn it must be filled with oil the great peacock renounces the joys of the palate but with them it surrenders long life two or three nightsjust long enough to allow the couple to meet and mateand all is over the great butterfly is dead what then is meant by the nonappearance of those whose antenn i removed did they prove that the lack of antenn rendered them incapable of finding the cage in which the prisoner waited by no means like those marked with the tonsure which had undergone no damaging operation they proved only that their time was finished mutilated or intact they could do no more on account of age and their absence meant nothing owing to the delay inseparable from the experiment the part played by the antenn escaped me it was doubtful before it remained doubtful my prisoner under the wiregauze cover lived for eight days every night she attracted a swarm of visitors now to one part of the house now to another i caught them with the net and released them as soon as captured in a closed room where they passed the night on the next day they were marked by means of a slight tonsure on the thorax the total number of butterflies attracted on these eight nights amounted to a hundred and fifty a stupendous number when i consider what searches i had to undertake during the two following years in order to collect the specimens necessary to the continuation of my investigation without being absolutely undiscoverable in my immediate neighbourhood the cocoons of the great peacock are at least extremely rare as the trees on which they are found are not common for two winters i visited all the decrepit almondtrees at hand inspected them all at the base of the trunk under the jungle of stubborn grasses and undergrowth that surrounded them and how often i returned with empty hands thus my hundred and fifty butterflies had come from some little distance perhaps from a radius of a mile and a quarter or more how did they learn of what was happening in my study three agents of information affect the senses at a distance sight sound and smell can we speak of vision in this connection sight could very well guide the arrivals once they had entered the open window but how could it help them out of doors among unfamiliar surroundings even the fabulous eye of the lynx which could see through walls would not be sufficient we should have to imagine a keenness of vision capable of annihilating leagues of space it is needless to discuss the matter further sight cannot be the guiding sense sound is equally out of the question the bigbodied creature capable of calling her mates from such a distance is absolutely mute even to the most sensitive ear does she perhaps emit vibrations of such delicacy or rapidity that only the most sensitive microphone could appreciate them the idea is barely possible but let us remember that the visitors must have been warned at distances of some thousands of yards under these conditions it is useless to think of acoustics smell remains scent better than any other impression in the domain of our senses would explain the invasion of butterflies and their difficulty at the very last in immediately finding the object of their search are there effluvia analogous to what we call odour effluvia of extreme subtlety absolutely imperceptible to us yet capable of stimulating a senseorgan far more sensitive than our own a simple experiment suggested itself i would mask these effluvia stifle them under a powerful tenacious odour which would take complete possession of the senseorgan and neutralise the less powerful impression i began by sprinkling naphthaline in the room intended for the reception of the males that evening beside the female inside the wiregauze cover i placed a large capsule full of the same substance when the hour of the nocturnal visit arrived i had only to stand at the door of the room to smell a smell as of a gasworks well my artifice failed the butterflies arrived as usual entered the room traversed its gasladen atmosphere and made for the wiregauze cover with the same certainty as in a room full of fresh air my confidence in the olfactory theory was shaken moreover i could not continue my experiments on the ninth day exhausted by her fruitless period of waiting the female died having first deposited her barren eggs upon the woven wire of her cage lacking a female nothing could be done until the following year i determined next time to take suitable precautions and to make all preparations for repeating at will the experiments already made and others which i had in mind i set to work at once without delay in the summer i began to buy caterpillars at a halfpenny apiece the market was in the hands of some neighbouring urchins my habitual providers on friday free of the terrors of grammar they scoured the fields finding from time to time the great peacock caterpillar and bringing it to me clinging to the end of a stick they did not dare to touch it poor little imps they were thunderstruck at my audacity when i seized it in my fingers as they would the familiar silkworm reared upon twigs of the almondtree my menagerie soon provided me with magnificent cocoons in winter assiduous search at the base of the native trees completed my collection friends interested in my researches came to my aid finally after some trouble what with an open market commercial negotiations and searching at the cost of many scratches in the undergrowth i became the owner of an assortment of cocoons of which twelve larger and heavier than the rest announced that they were those of females disappointment awaited me may arrived a capricious month which set my preparations at naught troublesome as these had been winter returned the mistral shrieked tore the budding leaves of the planetrees and scattered them over the ground it was cold as december we had to light fires in the evening and resume the heavy clothes we had begun to leave off my butterflies were too sorely tried they emerged late and were torpid around my cages in which the females waitedtoday one tomorrow another according to the order of their birthfew males or none came from without yet there were some in the neighbourhood for those with large antenn which issued from my collection of cocoons were placed in the garden directly they had emerged and were recognised whether neighbours or strangers very few came and those without enthusiasm for a moment they entered then disappeared and did not reappear the lovers were as cold as the season perhaps too the low temperature was unfavourable to the informing effluvia which might well be increased by heat and lessened by cold as is the case with many odours my year was lost research is disappointing work when the experimenter is the slave of the return and the caprices of a brief season of the year for the third time i began again i reared caterpillars i scoured the country in search of cocoons when may returned i was tolerably provided the season was fine responding to my hopes i foresaw the affluence of butterflies which had so impressed me at the outset when the famous invasion occurred which was the origin of my experiments every night by squadrons of twelve twenty or more the visitors appeared the female a strapping bigbellied matron clung to the woven wire of the cover there was no movement on her part not even a flutter of the wings one would have thought her indifferent to all that occurred no odour was emitted that was perceptible to the most sensitive nostrils of the household no sound that the keenest ears of the household could perceive motionless recollected she waited the males by twos by threes and more fluttered upon the dome of the cover scouring over it quickly in all directions beating it continually with the ends of their wings there were no conflicts between rivals each did his best to penetrate the enclosure without betraying any sign of jealousy of the others tiring of their fruitless attempts they would fly away and join the dance of the gyrating crowd some in despair would escape by the open window newcomers would replace them and until ten oclock or thereabouts the wire dome of the cover would be the scene of continual attempts at approach incessantly commencing quickly wearying quickly resumed every night the position of the cage was changed i placed it north of the house and south on the groundfloor and the first floor in the right wing of the house or fifty yards away in the left wing in the open air or hidden in some distant room all these sudden removals devised to put the seekers off the scent troubled them not at all my time and my pains were wasted so far as deceiving them was concerned the memory of places has no part in the finding of the female for instance the day before the cage was installed in a certain room the males visited the room and fluttered about the cage for a couple of hours and some even passed the night there on the following day at sunset when i moved the cage all were out of doors although their lives are so ephemeral the youngest were ready to resume their nocturnal expeditions a second and even a third time where did they first go these veterans of a day they knew precisely where the cage had been the night before one would have expected them to return to it guided by memory and that not finding it they would go out to continue their search elsewhere no contrary to my expectation nothing of the kind appeared none came to the spot which had been so crowded the night before none paid even a passing visit the room was recognised as an empty room with no previous examination such as would apparently be necessary to contradict the memory of the place a more positive guide than memory called them elsewhere hitherto the female was always visible behind the meshes of the wiregauze cover the visitors seeing plainly in the dark night must have been able to see her by the vague luminosity of what for us is the dark what would happen if i imprisoned her in an opaque receptacle would not such a receptacle arrest or set free the informing effluvia according to its nature practical physics has given us wireless telegraphy by means of the hertzian vibrations of the ether had the great peacock butterfly outstripped and anticipated mankind in this direction in order to disturb the whole surrounding neighbourhood to warn pretenders at a distance of a mile or more does the newly emerged female make use of electric or magnetic waves known or unknown that a screen of one material would arrest while another would allow them to pass in a word does she after her fashion employ a system of wireless telegraphy i see nothing impossible in this insects are responsible for many inventions equally marvellous accordingly i lodged the female in boxes of various materials boxes of tinplate wood and cardboard all were hermetically closed even sealed with a greasy paste i also used a glass bell resting upon a baseplate of glass under these conditions not a male arrived not one though the warmth and quiet of the evening were propitious whatever its nature whether of glass metal card or wood the closed receptacle was evidently an insuperable obstacle to the warning effluvia a layer of cottonwool two fingers in thickness had the same result i placed the female in a large glass jar and laced a piece of thin cotton batting over the mouth for a cover this again guarded the secret of my laboratory not a male appeared but when i placed the females in boxes which were imperfectly closed or which had chinks in their sides or even hid them in a drawer or a cupboard i found the males arrived in numbers as great as when the object of their search lay in the cage of open wirework freely exposed on a table i have a vivid memory of one evening when the recluse was hidden in a hatbox at the bottom of a wallcupboard the arrivals went straight to the closed doors and beat them with their wings toctoc trying to enter wandering pilgrims come from i know not where across fields and meadows they knew perfectly what was behind the doors of the cupboard so we must abandon the idea that the butterfly has any means of communication comparable to our wireless telegraphy as any kind of screen whether a good or a bad conductor completely stops the signals of the female to give them free passage and allow them to penetrate to a distance one condition is indispensable the enclosure in which the captive is confined must not be hermetically sealed there must be a communication between it and the outer air this again points to the probability of an odour although this is contradicted by my experiment with the naphthaline my cocoons were all hatched and the problem was still obscure should i begin all over again in the fourth year i did not do so for the reason that it is difficult to observe a nocturnal butterfly if one wishes to follow it in all its intimate actions the lover needs no light to attain his ends but my imperfect human vision cannot penetrate the darkness i should require a candle at least and a candle would be constantly extinguished by the revolving swarm a lantern would obviate these eclipses but its doubtful light interspersed with heavy shadows by no means commends it to the scruples of an observer who must see and see well moreover the light of a lamp diverts the butterflies from their object distracts them from their affairs and seriously compromises the success of the observer the moment they enter they rush frantically at the flame singe their down and thereupon terrified by the heat are of no profit to the observer if instead of being roasted they are held at a distance by an envelope of glass they press as closely as they can to the flame and remain motionless hypnotised illustration the great peacock moth the pilgrims diverted by the light of a lamp one night the female being in the diningroom on the table facing the open window a petroleum lamp furnished with a large reflector in opaline glass was hanging from the ceiling the arrivals alighted on the dome of the wiregauze cover crowding eagerly about the prisoner others saluting her in passing flew to the lamp circled round it a few times and then fascinated by the luminous splendour radiating from the opal cone of light clung there motionless under the reflector already the children were raising their hands to seize them leave them i said leave them let us be hospitable do not disturb the pilgrims who have come to the tabernacle of the light during the whole evening not one of them moved next day they were still there the intoxication of the light had made them forget the intoxication of love with creatures so madly in love with the light precise and prolonged experimentation is impracticable the moment the observer requires artificial light i renounced the great peacock and its nocturnal habits i required a butterfly with different habits equally notable as a lover but seeking out the beloved by day before going on to speak of my experiments with a subject fulfilling these conditions let me break the chronological order of my record in order to say a few words concerning another insect which appeared after i had completed these inquiries i refer to the lesser peacock attacus pavonia minor lin some one brought me from what locality i do not know a superb cocoon enveloped in an ample wrapping of white silk from this covering which lay in large irregular folds the chrysalis was easily detached in shape like that of the great peacock but considerably less in size the anterior extremity which is defended by an arrangement of fine twigs converging and free at the converging ends forming a device not unlike an eelpot which presents access to the chrysalis while allowing the butterfly to emerge without breaking the defence indicated a relative of the great nocturnal butterfly the silkwork denoted a spinning caterpillar towards the end of march this curious cocoon yielded up a female of the lesser peacock which was immediately sequestered under a wiregauze cover in my study i opened the window to allow news of the event to reach the surrounding country and left it open so that such visitors as presented themselves should find free access to the cage the captive clung to the wire gauze and did not move for a week she was a superb creature this prisoner of mine with her suit of brown velvet crossed by undulating lines the neck was surrounded by white fur there was a carmine spot at the extremity of the upper wings and four great eyes in which were grouped in concentric crescents black white red and yellow ochre almost the colouring of the great peacock but more vivid three or four times in my life i had encountered this butterfly so remarkable for its size and its costume the cocoon i had recently seen for the first time the male i had never seen i only knew that according to the books it was half the size of the female and less vividly coloured with orangeyellow on the lower wings would he appear the elegant unknown with waving plumes the butterfly i had never yet seen so rare does the lesser peacock seem to be in our country would he in some distant hedge receive warning of the bride who waited on my study table i dared to hope it and i was right he arrived even sooner than i had hoped noon struck as we were sitting down to table when little paul delayed by his absorption in the expected event suddenly ran to rejoin us his cheeks glowing between his fingers we saw the fluttering wings of a handsome butterfly caught but a moment before while it was hovering in front of my study he showed it me questioning me with his eyes aha i cried this is precisely the pilgrim we are waiting for fold your napkin and come and see what happens we will dine later dinner was forgotten before the marvels that came to pass with inconceivable punctuality the butterflies hastened to meet the magical call of the captive with tortuous flight they arrived one by one all came from the north this detail is significant a week earlier there had been a savage return of the winter the bise blew tempestuously killing the early almond blossom it was one of those ferocious storms which in the south commonly serve as a prelude to the spring but the temperature had now suddenly softened although the wind still blew from the north now on this first occasion all the butterflies hastening to the prisoner entered the garden from the north they followed the direction of the wind not one flew against it if their guide was a sense of smell like ours if they were guided by fragrant atoms suspended in the air they should have arrived in the opposite direction coming from the south we might believe them to be warned by effluvia carried on the wind coming from the north in time of mistral that resistless sweeper of earth and air how can we suppose that they had perceived at a remote distance what we will call an odour the idea of a flow of odoriferous atoms in a direction contrary to that of the aerial torrent seems to me inadmissible for two hours under a radiant sun the visitors came and went before the outer wall of the study most of them sought for a long time exploring the wall flying on a level with the ground to see them thus hesitating you would say that they were puzzled to find the exact position of the lure which called them although they had come from such a distance without a mistake they seemed imperfectly informed once they were on the spot nevertheless sooner or later they entered the room and saluted the captive without showing any great ardour at two oclock all was over ten butterflies had arrived during the whole week and always about noon at the hour of the brightest sunlight the butterflies arrived but in decreasing numbers the total approached forty i thought it useless to repeat experiments which would add nothing to what i had already learned i will confine myself to stating two facts in the first place the lesser peacock is diurnal that is to say it celebrates its mating under the dazzling brilliance of noon it needs the full force of the sunlight the great peacock on the contrary which it so closely resembles both in its adult form and the work of its caterpillar requires the darkness of the first hours of the night who can explain this strange contrast in habits in the second place a powerful current of air sweeping away in a contrary direction all particles that might inform the sense of smell does not prevent the butterflies from arriving from a direction opposite to that taken by the effluvial stream as we understand such matters to continue i needed a diurnal moth or butterfly not the lesser peacock which came too late when i had nothing to ask of it but another no matter what provided it was a prompt guest at the wedding feast was i to find such an insect chapter xv the oak eggar or banded monk yes i was to find it i even had it already in my possession an urchin of seven years with an alert countenance not washed every day bare feet and dilapidated breeches supported by a piece of string who frequented the house as a dealer in turnips and tomatoes arrived one day with his basket of vegetables having received the few halfpence expected by his mother as the price of the gardenstuff and having counted them one by one into the hollow of his hand he took from his pocket an object which he had discovered the day before beneath a hedge when gathering greenstuff for his rabbits and thiswill you have this he said handing me the object why certainly i will have it try to find me more as many as you can and on sunday you shall have lots of rides on the wooden horses in the meantime here is a penny for you dont forget it when you make up your accounts dont mix it with your turnipmoney put it by itself beaming with satisfaction at such wealth little touzlehead promised to search industriously already foreseeing a fortune when he had gone i examined the thing it was worth examination it was a fine cocoon thick and with blunt ends very like a silkworms cocoon firm to the touch and of a tawny colour a brief reference to the textbooks almost convinced me that this was a cocoon of the bombyx quercus4 if so what a find i could continue my inquiry and perhaps confirm what my study of the great peacock had made me suspect the bombyx of the oaktree is in fact a classic moth indeed there is no entomological textbook but speaks of its exploits at matingtime it is said that a female emerged from the pupa in captivity in the interior of an apartment and even in a closed box it was far from the country amidst the tumult of a large city nevertheless the event was known to those concerned in the woods and meadows guided by some mysterious compass the males arrived hastening from the distant fields they went to the box fluttered against it and flew to and fro in the room these marvels i had learned by reading but to see such a thing with ones own eyes and at the same time to devise experiments is quite another thing what had my penny bargain in store for me would the famous bombyx issue from it let us call it by its other name the banded monk this original name of monk was suggested by the costume of the male a monks robe of a modest rusty red but in the case of the female the brown fustian gives place to a beautiful velvet with a pale transversal band and little white eyes on the fore pair of wings the monk is not a common butterfly which can be caught by any one who takes out a net at the proper season i have never seen it around our village or in the solitude of my grounds during a residence of twenty years it is true that i am not a fervent butterflycatcher the dead insect of the collectors cabinet has little interest for me i must have it living in the exercise of its functions but although i have not the collectors zeal i have an attentive eye to all that flies or crawls in the fields a butterfly so remarkable for its size and colouring would never have escaped my notice had i encountered it the little searcher whom i had enticed by a promise of rides upon wooden horses never made a second find for three years i requisitioned friends and neighbours and especially their children sharpsighted snappersup of trifles i myself hunted often under heaps of withered leaves i inspected stoneheaps and visited hollow treetrunks useless pains the precious cocoon was not to be found it is enough to say that the banded monk is extremely rare in my neighbourhood the importance of this fact will presently appear as i suspected my cocoon was truly that of the celebrated oak eggar on the 20th of august a female emerged from it corpulent bigbellied coloured like the male but lighter in hue i placed her under the usual wire cover in the centre of my laboratory table littered as it was with books bottles trays boxes testtubes and other apparatus i have explained the situation in speaking of the great peacock two windows light the room both opening on the garden one was closed the other open day and night the butterfly was placed in the shade between the lines of the two windows at a distance of 12 or 15 feet the rest of that day and the next went by without any occurrence worthy of notice hanging by the feet to the front of the wire cover on the side nearest to the light the prisoner was motionless inert there was no oscillation of the wings no tremor of the antenn the female of the great peacock behaved in a similar fashion the female bombyx gradually matured her tender tissues gradually becoming firmer by some process of which our scientists have not the least idea she elaborated a mysterious lure which would bring her lovers from the four corners of the sky what was happening in this bigbellied body what transmutations were accomplished thus to affect the whole countryside on the third day the bride was ready the festival opened brilliantly i was in the garden already despairing of success for the days were passing and nothing had occurred when towards three in the afternoon the weather being very hot and the sun radiant i perceived a crowd of butterflies gyrating in the embrasure of the open window the lovers had at last come to visit their lady some were emerging from the room others were entering it others clinging to the wall of the house were resting as though exhausted by a long journey i could see others approaching in the distance flying over the walls over the screens of cypress they came from all directions but at last with decreasing frequency i had missed the opening of the convocation and now the gathering was almost complete i went indoors and upstairs this time in full daylight and without losing a detail i witnessed once more the astonishing spectacle to which the great nocturnal butterfly had first introduced me the study contained a cloud of males which i estimated at a glance as being about sixty in number so far as the movement and confusion allowed me to count them at all after circling a few times over the cage many of them went to the open window but returned immediately to recommence their evolutions the most eager alighted on the cover trampling on one another jostling one another trying to get the best places on the other side of the barrier the captive her great body hanging against the wire waited immovable she betrayed not a sign of emotion in the face of this turbulent swarm going and entering perched on the cover or fluttering round the room for more than three hours they continued their frenzied saraband but the sun was sinking and the temperature was slowly falling the ardour of the butterflies also cooled many went out not to return others took up their positions to wait for the gaieties of the following day they clung to the crossbars of the closed window as the males of the great peacock had done the rejoicings were over for the day they would certainly be renewed on the morrow since the courtship was without result on account of the barrier of the wiregauze cover but alas i to my great disappointment they were not resumed and the fault was mine late in the day a praying mantis was brought to me which merited attention on account of its exceptionally small size preoccupied with the events of the afternoon and absentminded i hastily placed the predatory insect under the same cover as the moth it did not occur to me for a moment that this cohabitation could lead to any harm the mantis was so slender and the other so corpulent alas i little knew the fury of carnage animating the creature that wielded those tiny grapplingirons next morning i met with a disagreeable surprise i found the little mantis devouring the great moth the head and the fore part of the thorax had already disappeared horrible creature at what an evil hour you came to me goodbye to my researches the plans which i had caressed all night in my imagination for three years for lack of a subject i was unable to resume them bad luck however was not to make me forget the little i had learned on one single occasion about sixty males had arrived considering the rarity of the oak eggar and remembering the years of fruitless search on the part of my helpers and myself this number was no less than stupefying the undiscoverable had suddenly become multitudinous at the call of the female whence did they come from all sides and undoubtedly from considerable distances during my prolonged searches every bush and thicket and heap of stones in my neighbourhood had become familiar to me and i can assert that the oak eggar was not to be found there for such a swarm to collect as i found in my laboratory the moths must have come from all directions from the whole district and within a radius that i dare not guess at three years went by and by chance two more cocoons of the monk or oak eggar again fell into my hands both produced females at an interval of a few days towards the middle of august so that i was able to vary and repeat my experiments i rapidly repeated the experiments which had given me such positive results in the instance of the great peacock moth the pilgrims of the day were no less skilful at finding their mates than the pilgrims of the night they laughed at all my tricks infallibly they found the prisoners in their wiregauze prisons no matter in what part of the house they were placed they discovered them in the depths of a wallcupboard they divined the secret of all manner of boxes provided these were not rigorously airtight they came no longer when the box was hermetically sealed so far this was only a repetition of the feats of the great peacock a box perfectly closed so that the air contained therein had no communication with the external atmosphere left the male in complete ignorance of the recluse not a single one arrived even when the box was exposed and plain to see on the windowsill thus the idea of strongly scented effluvia which are cut off by screens of wood metal card glass or what not returns with double force i have shown that the great nocturnal moth was not thrown off the scent by the powerful odour of naphthaline which i thought would mask the extrasubtle emanations of the female which were imperceptible to human olfactory organs i repeated the experiment with the oak eggar this time i used all the resources of scent and stench that my knowledge of drugs would permit a dozen saucers were arranged some in the interior of the wiregauze cover the prison of the female and some around it in an unbroken circle some contained naphthaline others the essential oil of spikelavender others petroleum and others a solution of alkaline sulphur giving off a stench of rotten eggs short of asphyxiating the prisoner i could do no more these arrangements were made in the morning so that the room should be saturated when the congregation of lovers should arrive in the afternoon the laboratory was filled with the most abominable stench in which the penetrating aroma of spikelavender and the stink of sulphuretted hydrogen were predominant i must add that tobacco was habitually smoked in this room and in abundance the concerted odours of a gasworks a smokingroom a perfumery a petroleum well and a chemical factorywould they succeed in confusing the male moths by no means about three oclock the moths arrived in as great numbers as usual they went straight to the cage which i had covered with a thick cloth in order to add to their difficulties seeing nothing when once they had entered and immersed in an extraordinary atmosphere in which any subtle fragrance should have been annihilated they nevertheless made straight for the prisoner and attempted to reach her by burrowing under the linen cloth my artifice had no result after this setback so obvious in its consequences which only repeated the lesson of the experiments made with naphthaline when my subject was the great peacock i ought logically to have abandoned the theory that the moths are guided to their wedding festivities by means of strongly scented effluvia that i did not do so was due to a fortuitous observation chance often has a surprise in store which sets us on the right road when we have been seeking it in vain one afternoon while trying to determine whether sight plays any part in the search for the female once the males had entered the room i placed the female in a bellglass and gave her a slender twig of oak with withered leaves as a support the glass was set upon a table facing the open window upon entering the room the moths could not fail to see the prisoner as she stood directly in the way the tray containing a layer of sand on which the female had passed the preceding day and night covered with a wiregauze dishcover was in my way without premeditation i placed it at the other end of the room on the floor in a corner where there was but little light it was a dozen yards away from the window the result of these preparations entirely upset my preconceived ideas none of the arrivals stopped at the bellglass where the female was plainly to be seen the light falling full upon her prison not a glance not an inquiry they all flew to the further end of the room into the dark corner where i had placed the tray and the empty dishcover they alighted on the wire dome explored it persistently beating their wings and jostling one another all the afternoon until sunset the moths danced about the empty cage the same saraband that the actual presence of the female had previously evoked finally they departed not all for there were some that would not go held by some magical attractive force truly a strange result the moths collected where there was apparently nothing to attract them and remained there unpersuaded by the sense of sight they passed the bellglass actually containing the female without halting for a moment although she must have been seen by many of the moths both going and coming maddened by a lure they paid no attention to the reality what was the lure that so deceived them all the preceding night and all the morning the female had remained under the wiregauze cover sometimes clinging to the wirework sometimes resting on the sand in the tray whatever she touchedabove all apparently with her distended abdomenwas impregnated as a result of long contact with a certain emanation this was her lure her lovephiltre this it was that revolutionised the oak eggar world the sand retained it for some time and diffused the effluvium in turn they passed by the glass prison in which the female was then confined and hastened to the meshes of wire and the sand on which the magic philtre had been poured they crowded round the deserted chamber where nothing of the magician remained but the odorous testimony of her sojourn the irresistible philtre requires time for its elaboration i conceive of it as an exhalation which is given off during courtship and gradually saturates whatever is in contact with the motionless body of the female if the bellglass was placed directly on the table or still better on a square of glass the communication between the inside and the outside was insufficient and the males perceiving no odour did not arrive so long as that condition of things obtained it was plain that this failure of transmission was not due to the action of the glass as a screen simply for if i established a free communication between the interior of the bellglass and the open air by supporting it on three small blocks the moths did not collect round it at once although there were plenty in the room but in the course of half an hour or so the feminine alembic began to operate and the visitors crowded round the bellglass as usual in possession of these data and this unexpected enlightenment i varied the experiments but all pointed to the same conclusion in the morning i established the female under the usual wiregauze cover for support i gave her a little twig of oak as before there motionless as if dead she crouched for hours half buried in the dry leaves which would thus become impregnated with her emanations when the hour of the daily visits drew near i removed the twig which was by then thoroughly saturated with the emanations and laid it on a chair not far from the open window on the other hand i left the female under the cover plainly exposed on the table in the middle of the room the moths arrived as usual first one then two then three and presently five and six they entered flew out again reentered mounted descended came and went always in the neighbourhood of the window not far from which was the chair on which the twig lay none made for the large table on which a few steps further from the window the female awaited them in the wiregauze cover they hesitated that was plain they were still seeking finally they found and what did they find simply the twig which that morning had served the ample matron as bed their wings rapidly fluttering they alighted on the foliage they explored it over and under probed it raised it and displaced it so that the twig finally fell to the floor none the less they continued to probe between the leaves under the buffets and the draught of their wings and the clutches of their eager feet the little bundle of leaves ran along the floor like a scrap of paper patted by the paws of a cat while the twig was sliding away with its band of investigators two new arrivals appeared the chair lay in their path they stopped at it and searched eagerly at the very spot on which the twig had been lying but with these as with the others the real object of their desires was there close by under a wire cover which was not even veiled none took any note of it on the floor a handful of butterflies were still hustling the bunch of leaves on which the female had reposed that morning others on the chair were still examining the spot where the twig had lain the sun sank and the hour of departure struck moreover the emanations were growing feebler were evaporating without more ado the visitors left we bade them goodbye till the morrow the following tests showed me that the leafcovered twig which accidentally enlightened me might be replaced by any other substance some time before the visitors were expected i placed the female on a bed of cloth or flannel card or paper i even subjected her to the rigours of a campbed of wood glass marble and metal all these objects after a contact of sufficient duration had the same attraction for the males as the female moth herself they retained this property for a longer or shorter time according to their nature cardboard flannel dust sand and porous objects retained it longest metals marble and glass on the contrary quickly lost their efficacy finally anything on which the female had rested communicated its virtues by contact witness the butterflies crowding on the strawbottomed chair after the twig fell to the ground using one of the most favourable materialsflannel for examplei witnessed a curious sight i placed a morsel of flannel on which the mother moth had been lying all the morning at the bottom of a long testtube or narrownecked bottle just permitting of the passage of a male moth the visitors entered the vessels struggled and did not know how to extricate themselves i had devised a trap by means of which i could exterminate the tribe delivering the prisoners and removing the flannel which i placed in a perfectly closed box i found that they reentered the trap attracted by the effluvia that the flannel had communicated to the glass i was now convinced to call the moths of the countryside to the weddingfeast to warn them at a distance and to guide them the nubile female emits an odour of extreme subtlety imperceptible to our own olfactory senseorgans even with their noses touching the moth none of my household has been able to perceive the faintest odour not even the youngest whose sensibility is as yet unvitiated this scent readily impregnates any object on which the female rests for any length of time when this object becomes a centre of attraction as active as the moth herself until the effluvium is evaporated nothing visible betrays the lure on a sheet of paper a recent restingplace around which the visitors had crowded there was no visible trace no moisture the surface was as clean as before the impregnation the product is elaborated slowly and must accumulate a little before it reveals its full power taken from her couch and placed elsewhere the female loses her attractiveness for the moment and is an object of indifference it is to the restingplace saturated by long contact that the arrivals fly but the female soon regains her power the emission of the warning effluvium is more or less delayed according to the species the recently metamorphosed female must mature a little and her organs must settle to their work born in the morning the female of the great peacock moth sometimes has visitors the night of the same day but more often on the second day after a preparation of forty hours or so the oak eggar does not publish her banns of marriage before the third or fourth day let us return for a moment to the problematical function of the antenn the male oak eggar has a sumptuous pair as has the great peacock or emperor moth are we to regard these silky feelers as a kind of directing compassi resumed but without attaching much importance to the matter my previous experiment of amputation none of those operated on returned do not let us draw conclusions from that fact alone we saw in the case of the great peacock that more serious reasons than the truncation of the antenn made return as a rule impossible moreover a second bombyx or eggar the clover moth very like the oak eggar and like it superbly plumed poses us a very difficult problem it is fairly abundant around my home even in the orchard i find its cocoon which is easily confounded with that of the oak eggar i was at first deceived by the resemblance from six cocoons which i expected to yield oak eggars i obtained about the end of august six females of the other species well about these six females born in my house never a male appeared although they were undoubtedly present in the neighbourhood if the ample and feathery antenn are truly senseorgans which receive information of distant objects why were not my richly plumed neighbours aware of what was passing in my study why did their feathery feelers leave them in ignorance of events which would have brought flocks of the other eggar once more the organ does not determine the aptitude one individual or species is gifted but another is not despite an organic equality chapter xvi a trufflehunter the bolboceras gallicus in the matter of physics we hear of nothing today but the rntgen rays which penetrate opaque bodies and photograph the invisible a splendid discovery but nothing very remarkable as compared with the surprises reserved for us by the future when better instructed as to the why and wherefore of things than now and supplementing our feeble senses by means of science we shall succeed in rivalling however imperfectly the sensorial acuteness of the lower animals how enviable in how many cases is the superiority of the beasts it makes us realise the insufficiency of our impressions and the very indifferent efficacy of our senseorgans it proclaims realities which amaze us so far are they beyond our own attributes a miserable caterpillar the processional caterpillar found on the pinetree has its back covered with meteorological spiracles which sense the coming weather and foretell the storm the bird of prey that incomparable watchman sees the fallen mule from the heights of the clouds the blind bats guided their flight without collision through the inextricable labyrinth of threads devised by spallanzani the carrier pigeon at a hundred leagues from home infallibly regains its loft across immensities which it has never known and within the limits of its more modest powers a bee the chalicodoma also adventures into the unknown accomplishing its long journey and returning to its group of cells those who have never seen a dog seeking truffles have missed one of the finest achievements of the olfactory sense absorbed in his duties the animal goes forward scenting the wind at a moderate pace he stops questions the soil with his nostrils and without excitement scratches the earth a few times with one paw there it is master his eyes seem to say there it is on the faith of a dog there are truffles here he says truly the master digs at the point indicated if the spade goes astray the dog corrects the digger sniffing at the bottom of the hole have no fear that stones and roots will confuse him in spite of depth and obstacles the truffle will be found a dogs nose cannot lie i have referred to the dogs speciality as a subtle sense of smell that is certainly what i mean if you will understand by that that the nasal passages of the animal are the seat of the perceptive organ but is the thing perceived always a simple smell in the vulgar acceptation of the terman effluvium such as our own senses perceive i have certain reasons for doubting this which i will proceed to relate on various occasions i have had the good fortune to accompany a truffledog of firstclass capacities on his rounds certainly there was not much outside show about him this artist that i so desired to see at work a dog of doubtful breed placid and meditative uncouth ungroomed and quite inadmissible to the intimacies of the hearthrug talent and poverty are often mated his master a celebrated rabassier5 of the village being convinced that my object was not to steal his professional secrets and so sooner or later to set up in business as a competitor admitted me of his company a favour of which he was not prodigal from the moment of his regarding me not as an apprentice but merely as a curious spectator who drew and wrote about subterranean vegetable affairs but had no wish to carry to market my bagful of these glories of the christmas goose the excellent man lent himself generously to my designs it was agreed between us that the dog should act according to his own instincts receiving the customary reward after each discovery no matter what its size of a crust of bread the size of a fingernail every spot scratched by his paw should be excavated and the object indicated was to be extracted without reference to its marketable value in no case was the experience of the master to intervene in order to divert the dog from a spot where the general aspect of things indicated that no commercial results need be expected for i was more concerned with the miserable specimens unfit for the market than with the choice specimens though of course the latter were welcomed thus conducted this subterranean botanising was extremely fruitful with that perspicacious nose of his the dog obtained for me both large and small fresh and putrid odorous and inodorous fragrant and offensive i was amazed at my collection which comprised the greater number of the hypogenous fungi of the neighbourhood what a variety of structure and above all of odour the primordial quality in this question of scent there were some that had no appreciable scent beyond a vague fungoid flavour more or less common to all others smelt of turnips of sour cabbage some were fetid sufficiently so to make the house of the collector noisome only the true truffle possessed the aroma dear to epicures if odour as we understand it is the dogs only guide how does he manage to follow that guide amidst all these totally different odours is he warned of the contents of the subsoil by a general emanation by that fungoid effluvium common to all the species thus a somewhat embarrassing question arises i paid special attention to the ordinary toadstools and mushrooms which announced their near advent by cracking the surface of the soil now these points where my eyes divined the cryptogam pushing back the soil with its buttonlike heads these points where the ordinary fungoid odour was certainly very pronounced were never selected by the dog he passed them disdainfully without a sniff without a stroke of the paw yet the fungi were underground and their odour was similar to that i have already referred to i came back from my outings with the conviction that the trufflefinding nose has some better guide than odour such as we with our senseorgans conceive it it must perceive effluvia of another order as well entirely mysterious to us and therefore not utilised light has its dark raysrays without effect upon our retinas but not apparently on all why should not the domain of smell have its secret emanations unknown to our senses and perceptible to a different senseorgan if the scent of the dog leaves us perplexed in the sense that we cannot possibly say precisely cannot even suspect what it is that the dog perceives at least it is clear that it would be erroneous to refer everything to human standards the world of sensations is far larger than the limits of our own sensibility what numbers of facts relating to the interplay of natural forces must escape us for want of sufficiently sensitive organs the unknownthat inexhaustible field in which the men of the future will try their strengthhas harvests in store for us beside which our present knowledge would show as no more than a wretched gleaning under the sickle of science will one day fall the sheaves whose grain would appear today as senseless paradoxes scientific dreams no if you please but undeniable positive realities affirmed by the brute creation which in certain respects has so great an advantage over us despite his long practice of his calling despite the scent of the object he was seeking the rabassier could not divine the presence of the truffle which ripens in winter under the soil at a depth of a foot or two he must have the help of a dog or a pig whose scent is able to discover the secrets of the soil these secrets are known to various insects even better than to our two auxiliaries they have in exceptional perfection the power of discovering the tubers on which their larv are nourished from truffles dug up in a spoiled condition peopled with vermin and placed in that condition with a bed of fresh sand in a glass jar i have in the past obtained a small red beetle known as the trufflebeetle anisotoma cinnamomea panz and various diptera among which is a sapromyzon which by its sluggish flight and its fragile form recalls the scatophaga scybalaria the yellow velvety fly which is found in human excrement in the autumn the latter finds its refuge on the surface of the soil at the foot of a wall or hedge or under a bush but how does the former know just where the truffle lies under the soil or at what depth to penetrate to that depth or to seek in the subsoil is impossible its fragile limbs barely able to move a grain of sand its extended wings which would bar all progress in a narrow passage and its costume of bristling silken pile which would prevent it from slipping through crevices all make such a task impossible the sapromyzon is forced to lay its eggs on the surface of the soil but it does so on the precise spot which overlies the truffle for the grubs would perish if they had to wander at random in search of their provender the truffle being always thinly sown the truffle fly is informed by the sense of smell of the points favourable to its maternal plans it has the talents of the truffledog and doubtless in a higher degree for it knows naturally without having been taught what its rival only acquires through an artificial education it would be not uninteresting to follow the sapromyzon in its search in the open woods such a feat did not strike me as particularly possible the insect is rare flies off quickly when alarmed and is lost to view to observe it closely under such conditions would mean a loss of time and an assiduity of which i do not feel capable another trufflehunter will show us what we could hardly learn from the fly this is a pretty little black beetle with a pale velvety abdomen a spherical insect as large as a biggish cherrystone its official title is bolboceras gallicus muls by rubbing the end of the abdomen against the edge of the wingcases it produces a gentle chirping sound like the cheeping of nestlings when the motherbird returns to the nest with food the male wears a graceful horn on his head a duplicate in little of that of the copris hispanus deceived by this horn i at first took the insect for a member of the corporation of dungbeetles and as such i reared it in captivity i offered it the kind of diet most appreciated by its supposed relatives but never never would it touch such food for whom did i take it fie upon me to offer ordure to an epicure it required if not precisely the truffle known to our chefs and gourmets at least its equivalent this characteristic i grasped only after patient investigation at the southern foot of the hills of srignan not far from the village is a wood of maritime pines alternating with rows of cypress there towards toussaint after the autumnal rains you may find an abundance of the mushrooms or toadstools that affect the conifers especially the delicious lactaris which turns green if the points are rubbed and drips blood if broken in the warm days of autumn this is the favourite promenade of the members of my household being distant enough to exercise their young legs but near enough not to fatigue them there one finds and sees all manner of things old magpies nests great bundles of twigs jays wrangling after filling their crops with the acorns of the neighbouring oaks rabbits whose little white upturned scuts go bobbing away through the rosemary bushes dungbeetles which are storing food for the winter and throwing up their rubbish on the threshold of their burrows and then the fine sand soft to the touch easily tunnelled easily excavated or built into tiny huts which we thatch with moss and surmount with the end of a reed for a chimney and the delicious meal of apples and the sound of the olian harps which softly whisper among the boughs of the pines for the children it is a real paradise where they can receive the reward of welllearned lessons the grownups also can share in the enjoyment as for myself for long years i have watched two insects which are found there without getting to the bottom of their domestic secrets one is the minotaurus typhus whose male carries on his corselet three spines which point forward the old writers called him the phalangist on account of his armour which is comparable to the three ranks of lances of the macedonian phalanx this is a robust creature heedless of the winter all during the cold season whenever the weather relents a little it issues discreetly from its lodging at nightfall and gathers in the immediate neighbourhood of its dwelling a few fragments of sheepdung and ancient olives which the summer suns have dried it stacks them in a row at the end of its burrow closes the door and consumes them when the food is broken up and exhausted of its meagre juices it returns to the surface and renews its store thus the winter passes famine being unknown unless the weather is exceptionally hard the second insect which i have observed for so long among the pines is the bolboceras its burrows scattered here and there higgledypiggledy with those of the minotaur are easy to recognise the burrow of the phalangist is surmounted by a voluminous rubbishdump the materials of which are piled in the form of a cylinder as long as the finger each of these dumps is a load of refuse and rubbish pushed outward by the little sapper which shoulders it up from below the orifice is closed whenever the insect is at home enlarging its tunnel or peacefully enjoying the contents of its larder the lodging of the bolboceras is open and surrounded simply by a mound of sand its depth is not great a foot or hardly more it descends vertically in an easily shifted soil it is therefore easy to inspect it if we take care first of all to dig a trench so that the wall of the burrow may be afterwards cut away slice by slice with the blade of a knife the burrow is thus laid bare along its whole extent from the surface to the bottom until nothing remains of it but a demicylindrical groove often the violated dwelling is empty the insect has departed in the night having finished its business there it is a nomad a nightwalker which leaves its dwelling without regret and easily acquires another often on the other hand the insect will be found at the bottom of the burrow sometimes a male sometimes a female but always alone the two sexes equally zealous in excavating their burrows work apart without collaboration this is no family mansion for the rearing of offspring it is a temporary dwelling made by each insect for its own benefit sometimes the burrow contains nothing but the wellsinker surprised at its work sometimesand not rarelythe hermit will be found embracing a small subterranean fungus entire or partly consumed it presses it convulsively to its bosom and will not be parted from it this is the insects booty its worldly wealth scattered crumbs inform us that we have surprised the beetle at a feast let us deprive the insect of its booty we find a sort of irregular rugged purselike object varying in size from the largeness of a pea to that of a cherry the exterior is reddish covered with fine warts having an appearance not unlike shagreen the interior which has no communication with the exterior is smooth and white the pores ovoidal and diaphanous are contained in groups of eight in long capsules from these characteristics we recognise an underground cryptogam known to the botanists as hydnocystis arenaria and a relation of the truffle this discovery begins to throw a light on the habits of the bolboceras and the cause of its burrows so frequently renewed in the calm of the twilight the little trufflehunter goes abroad chirping softly to encourage itself it explores the soil and interrogates it as to its contents exactly as does the trufflegatherers dog the sense of smell warns it that the desired object is beneath it covered by a few inches of sand certain of the precise point where the treasure lies it sinks a well vertically downwards and infallibly reaches it so long as there is food left it does not again leave the burrow it feasts happily at the bottom of its well heedless of the open or imperfectly closed burrow when no more food is left it removes in search of further booty which becomes the occasion of another burrow this too in its turn to be abandoned so many truffles eaten necessitate so many burrows which are mere diningrooms or pilgrims larders thus pass the autumn and the spring the seasons of the hydnocystis in the pleasures of the table and removal from one house to another to study the insect rabassier in my own house i had to obtain a small store of its favourite food to seek it myself by digging at random would have resulted merely in waste of time the little cryptogam is not so common that i could hope to find it without a guide the trufflehunter must have his dog my guide should be the bolboceras itself behold me then a rabassier of a kind hitherto unknown i have told my secret although i fear my original teacher will laugh at me if he ever hears of my singular form of competition the subterranean fungi grow only at certain points but they are often found in groups now the beetle has passed this way with its subtle sense of smell it has recognised the ground as favourable for its burrows are numerous let us dig then in the neighbourhood of these holes the sign is reliable in a few hours thanks to the signs of the bolboceras i obtain a handful of specimens of the hydnocystis it is the first time i have ever found this fungus in the ground let us now capture the insectan easy matter for we have only to excavate the burrows the same evening i begin my experiments a wide earthen pan is filled with fresh sand which has been passed through a sieve with the aid of a stick the thickness of a finger i make six vertical holes in the sand they are conveniently far apart and are eight inches in depth a hydnocystis is placed at the bottom of each a fine straw is then inserted to show me the precise position later finally the six holes are filled with sand which is beaten down so that all is firm when the surface is perfectly level and everywhere the same except for the six straws which mean nothing to the insect i release my beetles covering them with a wiregauze cover they are eight in number at first i see nothing but the inevitable fatigue due to the incidents of exhumation transport and confinement in a strange place my exiles try to escape they climb the wire walls and finally all take to earth at the edge of their enclosure night comes and all is quiet two hours later i pay my prisoners a last visit three are still buried under a thin layer of sand the other five have sunk each a vertical well at the very foot of the straws which indicate the position of the buried fungi next morning the sixth straw has its burrow like the rest it is time to see what is happening underground the sand is methodically removed in vertical slices at the bottom of each burrow is a bolboceras engaged in eating its truffle let us repeat the experiment with the partly eaten fungi the result is the same in one short night the food is divined under its covering of sand and attained by means of a burrow which descends as straight as a plumbline to the point where the fungus lies there has been no hesitation no trial excavations which have nearly discovered the object of search this is proved by the surface of the soil which is everywhere just as i left it when smoothing it down the insect could not make more directly for the objective if guided by the sense of sight it digs always at the foot of the straw my private sign the truffledog sniffing the ground in search of truffles hardly attains this degree of precision does the hydnocystis possess a very keen odour such as we should expect to give an unmistakable warning to the senses of the consumer by no means to our own sense of smell it is a neutral sort of object with no appreciable scent whatever a little pebble taken from the soil would affect our senses quite as strongly with its vague savour of fresh earth as a finder of underground fungi the bolboceras is the rival of the dog it would be the superior of the dog if it could generalise it is however a rigid specialist recognising nothing but the hydnocystis no other fungus to my knowledge either attracts it or induces it to dig6 both dog and beetle are very near the subsoil which they scrutinise the object they seek is at no great depth at a greater depth neither dog nor insect could perceive such subtle effluvia nor even the odour of the truffle to attract insect or animal at a great distance powerful odours are necessary such as our grosser senses can perceive then the exploiters of the odorous substance hasten from afar off and from all directions if for purposes of study i require specimens of such insects as dissect dead bodies i expose a dead mole to the sunlight in a distant corner of my orchard as soon as the creature is swollen with the gases of putrefaction and the fur commences to fall from the greenish skin a host of insects arrivesilphid dermestes hornbeetles and necrophoriof which not a single specimen could ever be obtained in my garden or even in the neighbourhood without the use of such a bait they have been warned by the sense of smell although far away in all directions while i myself can escape from the stench by recoiling a few paces in comparison with their sense of smell mine is miserable but in this case both for me and for them there is really what our language calls an odour i can do still better with the flower of the serpent arum arum dracunculus so noteworthy both for its form and its incomparable stench imagine a wide lanceolated blade of a vinous purple some twenty inches in length which is twisted at the base into an ovoid purse about the size of a hens egg through the opening of this capsule rises the central column a long club of a livid green surrounded at the base by two rings one of ovaries and the other of stamens such briefly is the flower or rather the inflorescence of the serpent arum for two days it exhales a horrible stench of putrid flesh a dead dog could not produce such a terrible odour set free by the sun and the wind it is odious intolerable let us brave the infected atmosphere and approach we shall witness a curious spectacle warned by the stench which travels far and wide a host of insects are flying hither such insects as dissect the corpses of frogs adders lizards hedgehogs moles and fieldmicecreatures that the peasant finds beneath his spade and throws disembowelled on the path they fall upon the great leaf whose livid purple gives it the appearance of a strip of putrid flesh they dance with impatience intoxicated by the corpselike odour which to them is so delicious they roll down its steep face and are engulfed in the capsule after a few hours of hot sunlight the receptacle is full let us look into the capsule through the narrow opening nowhere else could you see such a mob of insects it is a delirious mixture of backs and bellies wingcovers and legs which swarms and rolls upon itself rising and falling seething and boiling shaken by continual convulsions clicking and squeaking with a sound of entangled articulations it is a bacchanal a general access of delirium tremens a few but only a few emerge from the mass by the central mast or the walls of the purse they climb to the opening do they wish to take flight and escape by no means on the threshold of the cavity while already almost at liberty they allow themselves to fall into the whirlpool retaken by their madness the lure is irresistible none will break free from the swarm until the evening or perhaps the next day when the heady fumes will have evaporated then the units of the swarm disengage themselves from their mutual embraces and slowly as though regretfully take flight and depart at the bottom of this devils purse remains a heap of the dead and dying of severed limbs and wingcovers torn off the inevitable sequels of the frantic orgy soon the woodlice earwigs and ants will appear to prey upon the injured what are these insects doing were they the prisoners of the flower converted into a trap which allowed them to enter but prevented their escape by means of a palisade of converging hairs no they were not prisoners they had full liberty to escape as is proved by the final exodus which is in no way impeded deceived by a fallacious odour were they endeavouring to lay and establish their eggs as they would have done under the shelter of a corpse no there is no trace of eggs in the purse of the arum they came convoked by the odour of a decaying body their supreme delight an intoxication seized them and they rushed into the eddying swarm to take part in a festival of carrioneaters i was anxious to count the number of those attracted at the height of the bacchanal i emptied the purse into a bottle intoxicated as they were many would escape my census and i wished to ensure its accuracy a few drops of carbon bisulphide quieted the swarm the census proved that there were more than four hundred insects in the purse of the arum the collection consisted entirely of two speciesdermestes and saprinidboth eager prospectors of carrion and animal detritus during the spring my friend bull an honest dog all his lifetime if ever there was one amongst other eccentricities had the following finding in the dust of the road the shrivelled body of a mole flattened by the feet of pedestrians mummified by the heat of the sun he would slide himself over it from the tip of his nose to the root of his tail he would rub himself against it deliciously over and over again shaken with nervous spasms and roll upon it first in one direction then in the other it was his sachet of musk his flask of eaudecologne perfumed to his liking he would rise shake himself and proceed on his way delighted with his toilet do not let us scold him and above all do not let us discuss the matter there are all kinds of tastes in a world why should there not be insects with similar habits among the amateurs of corpselike savours we see dermestes and saprinid hastening to the arumflower all day long they writhe and wriggle in a swarm although perfectly free to escape numbers perish in the tumultuous orgy they are not retained by the desire of food for the arum provides them with nothing eatable they do not come to breed for they take care not to establish their grubs in that place of famine what are these frenzied creatures doing apparently they are intoxicated with fetidity as was bull when he rolled on the putrid body of a mole this intoxication draws them from all parts of the neighbourhood perhaps over considerable distances how far we do not know the necrophori in quest of a place where to establish their family travel great distances to find the corpses of small animals informed by such odours as offend our own senses at a considerable distance the hydnocystis the food of the bolboceras emits no such brutal emanations as these which readily diffuse themselves through space it is inodorous at least to our senses the insect which seeks it does not come from a distance it inhabits the places wherein the cryptogam is found faint as are the effluvia of this subterranean fungus the prospecting epicure being specially equipped perceives them with the greatest ease but then he operates at close range from the surface of the soil the truffledog is in the same case he searches with his nose to the ground the true truffle however the essential object of his search possesses a fairly vivid odour but what are we to say of the great peacock moth and the oak eggar both of which find their captive female they come from the confines of the horizon what do they perceive at that distance is it really an odour such as we perceive and understand i cannot bring myself to believe it the dog finds the truffle by smelling the earth quite close to the tuber but he finds his master at great distances by following his footsteps which he recognises by their scent yet can he find the truffle at a hundred yards or his master in the complete absence of a trail no with all his fineness of scent the dog is incapable of such feats as are realised by the moth which is embarrassed neither by distance nor the absence of a trail it is admitted that odour such as affects our olfactory sense consists of molecules emanating from the body whose odour is perceived the odorous material becomes diffused through the air to which it communicates its agreeable or disagreeable aroma odour and taste are to a certain extent the same in both there is contact between the material particles causing the impression and the sensitive papill affected by the impression that the serpent arum should elaborate a powerful essence which impregnates the atmosphere and makes it noisome is perfectly simple and comprehensible thus the dermestes and saprinid those lovers of corpselike odours are warned by molecular diffusion in the same way the putrid frog emits and disseminates around it atoms of putrescence which travel to a considerable distance and so attract and delight the necrophorus the carrionbeetle but in the case of the great peacock or the oak eggar what molecules are actually disengaged none according to our sense of smell and yet this lure to which the males hasten so speedily must saturate with its molecules an enormous hemisphere of aira hemisphere some miles in diameter what the atrocious fetor of the arum cannot do the absence of odour accomplishes however divisible matter may be the mind refuses such conclusions it would be to redden a lake with a grain of carmine to fill space with a mere nothing moreover where my laboratory was previously saturated with powerful odours which should have overcome and annihilated any particularly delicate effluvium the male moths arrived without the least indication of confusion or delay a loud noise stifles a feeble note and prevents it from being heard a brilliant light eclipses a feeble glimmer heavy waves overcome and obliterate ripples in the two cases cited we have waves of the same nature but a clap of thunder does not diminish the feeblest jet of light the dazzling glory of the sun will not muffle the slightest sound of different natures light and sound do not mutually interact my experiment with spikelavender naphthaline and other odours seems to prove that odour proceeds from two sources for emission substitute undulation and the problem of the great peacock moth is explained without any material emanation a luminous point shakes the ether with its vibrations and fills with light a sphere of indefinite magnitude so or in some such manner must the warning effluvium of the mother oak eggar operate the moth does not emit molecules but something about it vibrates causing waves capable of propagation to distances incompatible with an actual diffusion of matter from this point of view smell would have two domainsthat of particles dissolved in the air and that of etheric waves7 the former domain alone is known to us it is also known to the insect it is this that warns the saprinid of the fetid arum the silphid and the necrophori of the putrid mole the second category of odour far superior in its action through space escapes us completely because we lack the essential sensory equipment the great peacock moth and the oak eggar know it at the time of their nuptial festivities many others must share it in differing degrees according to the exigencies of their way of life like light odour has its xrays let science instructed by the insect one day give us a radiograph sensitive to odours and this artificial nose will open a new world of marvels chapter xvii the elephantbeetle some of our machines have extraordinarylooking mechanisms which remain inexplicable so long as they are seen in repose but wait until the whole is in motion then the uncouthlooking contrivance with its cogwheels interacting and its connectingrods oscillating will reveal the ingenious combination in which all things are skilfully disposed to produce the desired effects it is the same with certain insects with certain weevils for instance and notably with the acornbeetles or balanini which are adapted as their name denotes to the exploitation of acorns nuts and other similar fruits the most remarkable in my part of france is the acorn elephant balaninus elephas sch it is well named the very name evokes a mental picture of the insect it is a living caricature this beetle with the prodigious snout the latter is no thicker than a horsehair reddish in colour almost rectilinear and of such length that in order not to stumble the insect is forced to carry it stiffly outstretched like a lance in rest what is the use of this embarrassing pike this ridiculous snout here i can see some reader shrug his shoulders well if the only end of life is to make money by hook or by crook such questions are certainly ridiculous happily there are some to whom nothing in the majestic riddle of the universe is little they know of what humble materials the bread of thought is kneaded a nutriment no less necessary than the bread made from wheat and they know that both labourers and inquirers nourish the world with an accumulation of crumbs let us take pity on the question and proceed without seeing it at work we already suspect that the fantastic beak of the balaninus is a drill analogous to those which we ourselves use in order to perforate hard materials two diamondpoints the mandibles form the terminal armature of the drill like the larinid but under conditions of greater difficulty the curculionid must use the implement in order to prepare the way for the installation of their eggs but however well founded our suspicion may be it is not a certitude i can only discover the secret by watching the insect at work chance the servant of those that patiently solicit it grants me a sight of the acornbeetle at work in the earlier half of october my surprise is great for at this late season all industrial activity is as a rule at an end the first touch of cold and the entomological season is over today moreover it is wild weather the bise is moaning glacial cracking ones lips one needs a robust faith to go out on such a day in order to inspect the thickets yet if the beetle with the long beak exploits the acorns as i think it does the time presses if i am to catch it at its work the acorns still green have acquired their full growth in two or three weeks they will attain the chestnut brown of perfect maturity quickly followed by their fall my seemingly futile pilgrimage ends in success on the evergreen oaks i surprise a balaninus with the trunk half sunk in an acorn careful observation is impossible while the branches are shaken by the mistral i detach the twig and lay it gently upon the ground the insect takes no notice of its removal it continues its work i crouch beside it sheltered from the storm behind a mass of underwood and watch operations shod with adhesive sandals which later on in my laboratory will allow it rapidly to climb a vertical sheet of glass the elephantbeetle is solidly established on the smooth steep curvature of the acorn it is working its drill slowly and awkwardly it moves around its implanted weapon describing a semicircle whose centre is the point of the drill and then another semicircle in the reverse direction this is repeated over and over again the movement in short is identical with that we give to a bradawl when boring a hole in a plank little by little the rostrum sinks into the acorn at the end of an hour it has entirely disappeared a short period of repose follows and finally the instrument is withdrawn what is going to happen next nothing on this occasion the balaninus abandons its work and solemnly retires disappearing among the withered leaves for the day there is nothing more to be learned but my interest is now awakened on calm days more favourable to the entomologist i return to the woods and i soon have sufficient insects to people my laboratory cages foreseeing a serious difficulty in the slowness with which the beetle labours i prefer to study them indoors with the unlimited leisure only to be found in ones own home the precaution is fortunate if i had tried to continue as i began and to observe the balaninus in the liberty of the woods i should never even with the greatest good fortune have had the patience to follow to the end the choice of the acorn the boring of the hole and the laying of the eggs so meticulously deliberate is the insect in all its affairs as the reader will soon be able to judge three species of oaktree compose the copse inhabited by the balaninus the evergreen oak and the pubescent oak which would become fine trees if the woodman would give them time and the kermes oak a mere scrubby bush the first species which is the most abundant of the three is that preferred by the balaninus the acorn is firm elongated and of moderate size the cup is covered with little warts the acorns of the pubescent oak are usually stunted short wrinkled and fluted and subject to premature fall the aridity of the hills of srignan is unfavourable to them the acornbeetles accept them only in default of something better the kermes a dwarf oak a ridiculous tree which a man can jump over surprises me by the wealth of its acorns which are large ovoidal growths the cup being covered with scales the balaninus could not make a better choice the acorn affords a safe strong dwelling and a capacious storehouse of food a few twigs from these three trees well provided with acorns are arranged under the domes of some of my wiregauze covers the ends being plunged into a glass of water which will keep them fresh a suitable number of couples are then introduced into the cages and the latter are placed at the windows of my study where they obtain the direct sunlight for the greater part of the day let us now arm ourselves with patience and keep a constant watch upon events we shall be rewarded the exploitation of the acorn deserves to be seen matters do not drag on for very long two days after these preparations i arrive at the precise moment when the task is commenced the mother larger than the male and equipped with a longer drill is inspecting her acorn doubtless with a view to depositing her eggs she goes over it step by step from the point to the stem both above and below on the warty cup progression is easy over the rest of the surface it would be impossible were not the soles of her feet shod with adhesive pads which enable her to retain her hold in any position without the least uncertainty of footing the insect walks with equal facility over the top or bottom or up the sides of the slippery fruit the choice is made the acorn is recognised as being of good quality the time has come to sink the hole on account of its excessive length it is not easy to manoeuvre the beak to obtain the best mechanical effect the instrument must be applied perpendicularly to the convex surface of the acorn and the embarrassing implement which is carried in front of the insect when the latter is not at work must now be held in such a position as to be beneath the worker to obtain this result the insect rears herself upon her hind legs supporting herself upon the tripod formed by the end of the wingcovers and the posterior tarsi it would be hard to imagine anything more curious than this little carpenter as she stands upright and brings her nasal bradawl down towards her body now the drill is held plumb against the surface and the boring commences the method is that i witnessed in the wood on the day of the storm very slowly the insect veers round from right to left then from left to right her drill is not a spiral gimlet which will sink itself by a constant rotary motion it is a bradawl or rather a trochar which progresses by little bites by alternative erosion first in one direction then the other before continuing let me record an accident which is too striking to be passed over on various occasions i have found the insect dead in the midst of its task the body is in an extraordinary position which would be laughable if death were not always a serious thing above all when it comes suddenly in the midst of labour the drill is implanted in the acorn just a little beyond the tip the work was only commenced at the top of the drill at right angles to it the balaninus is suspended in the air far from the supporting surface of the acorn it is dried mummified dead i know not how long the legs are rigid and contracted under the body even if they retained the flexibility and the power of extension that were theirs in life they would fall far short of the surface of the acorn what then has happened that this unhappy insect should be impaled like a specimen beetle with a pin through its head an accident of the workshop is responsible on account of the length of its implement the beetle commences her work standing upright supported by the two hindlegs imagine a slip a false step on the part of the two adhesive feet the unfortunate creature will immediately lose her footing dragged by the elasticity of the snout which she was forced to bend somewhat at the beginning torn away from her foothold the suspended insect vainly struggles in air nowhere can her feet those safety anchors find a hold she starves at the end of her snout for lack of foothold whereby to extricate herself like the artisans in our factories the elephantbeetle is sometimes the victim of her tools let us wish her good luck and sure feet careful not to slip and proceed on this occasion all goes well but so slowly that the descent of the drill even when amplified by the magnifyingglass cannot be perceived the insect veers round perpetually rests and resumes her work an hour passes two hours wearying the observer by their sustained attention for i wish to witness the precise moment when the beetle withdraws her drill turns round and deposits her egg in the mouth of the orifice this at least is how i foresee the event two hours go by exhausting my patience i call the household to my aid three of us take turns keeping an uninterrupted watch upon the persevering creature whose secret i intend at any cost to discover illustration 1 the grey locust 1 the nervatures of the wing 2 the balaninus fallen a victim to the length of her proboscis it was well that i called in helpers to lend me their eyes and their attention after eight hourseight interminable hours when it was nearly night the sentinel on the watch calls me the insect appears to have finished she does in fact very cautiously withdraw her beak as though fearing to slip once the tool is withdrawn she holds it pointing directly in front of her the moment has come alas no once more i am cheated my eight hours of observation have been fruitless the balaninus decamps abandons her acorn without laying her eggs i was certainly right to distrust the result of observation in the open woods such concentration among the oaks exposed to the sun wind and rain would have been an intolerable task during the whole of october with the aid of such helpers as are needed i remark a number of borings not followed by the laying of eggs the duration of the observers task varies greatly it usually amounts to a couple of hours sometimes it exceeds half the day with what object are these perforations made so laborious and yet so often unused let us first of all discover the position of the egg and the first mouthfuls taken by the grub and perhaps the reply will be found the peopled acorns remain on the oak held in their cups as though nothing had occurred to the detriment of the cotyledons with a little attention they may be readily recognised not far from the cup on the smooth still green envelope of the acorn a little point is visible a tiny needleprick a narrow brown aureole the product of mortification is not long in appearing this marks the opening of the hole sometimes but more rarely the hole is drilled through the cup itself let us select those acorns which have been recently perforated that is to say those in which the perforation is not yet surrounded by the brown ring which appears in course of time let us shell them many contain nothing out of the way the balaninus has bored them but has not laid her eggs in them they resemble the acorns which for hours and hours were drilled in my laboratory but not utilised many on the contrary contain an egg now however distant the entrance of the bore may be this egg is always at the bottom of the acorn within the cup at the base of the cotyledonary matter the cup furnishes a thin film like swanskin which imbibes the sapid exudations from the stem the source of nourishment i have seen a young grub hatched under my eyes eat as his first mouthfuls this tender cottony layer which is moist and flavoured with tannin such nutriment juicy and easy of digestion like all nascent organic matter is only found in this particular spot and it is only there between the cup and the base of the cotyledons that the elephantbeetle establishes her egg the insect knows to a nicety the position of the portions best adapted to the feeble stomach of the newly hatched larva above this is the tougher nutriment of the cotyledons refreshed by its first meal the grub proceeds to attack this not directly but in the tunnel bored by the mother which is littered with tiny crumbs and halfmasticated shavings with this light mealy diet the strength of the grub increases and it then plunges directly into the substance of the acorn these data explain the tactics of the gravid mother what is her object when before proceeding to sink her hole she inspects her acorn from above below before and behind with such meticulous care she is making sure that the acorn is not already occupied the larder is amply stored but it does not contain enough for two never in fact have i found two larv in the same acorn one only always only one digests the copious meal and converts it into a greenish dust before leaving it and descending to the ground only an insignificant shell remains uneaten the rule is to each grub one acorn before trusting the egg to the acorn it is therefore essential to subject it to a thorough examination to discover whether it already has an occupant this possible occupant would be at the base of the acorn under the cover of the cup nothing could be more secret than this hidingplace not an eye could divine the inhabitant if the surface of the acorn did not bear the mark of a tiny perforation this mark just visible is my guide its presence tells me that the acorn is inhabited or at least that it has been prepared for the reception of the egg its absence tells me that the acorn has not yet been appropriated the elephantbeetle undoubtedly draws the same conclusions i see matters from on high with a comprehensive glance assisted at will by the magnifyingglass i turn the acorn between my fingers for a moment and the inspection is concluded the beetle investigating the acorn at close quarters is often obliged to scrutinise practically the entire surface before detecting the telltale spot moreover the welfare of her family demands a far more careful search than does my curiosity this is the reason for her prolonged and deliberate examination the search is concluded the acorn is recognised as unoccupied the drill is applied to the surface and rotated for hours then very often the insect departs disdaining the result of her work why such protracted efforts was the beetle piercing the fruit merely to obtain drink and refreshment was the beak thrust into the depths of the base merely to obtain from the choicer parts a few sips of nutritious sap was the whole undertaking merely a matter of personal nourishment at first i believed this to be the solution though surprised at the display of so much perseverance rewarded by the merest sip the behaviour of the males however forced me to abandon this idea they also possess the long beak and could readily make such perforations if they wished yet i have never seen one take up his stand upon an acorn and work at it with his augur then why this fruitless labour a mere nothing suffices these abstemious creatures a superficial operation performed upon the surface of a tender leaf yields them sufficient sustenance if the males the unoccupied males who have leisure to enjoy the pleasures of the palate ask no more than the sap of the leaf how should the mothers busied with the affairs of the breedingseason find time to waste upon such dearly bought pleasures as the inner juices of the acorn no the acorn is not perforated for the purpose of drinking its juices it is possible that once the beak is deeply sunk the female may take a mouthful or two but it is certain that food and drink are not the objects in view at last i begin to foresee the solution of the problem the egg as i have said is always at the base of the acorn in the midst of a soft cottony layer which is moistened by the sap which oozes from the stalk the grub upon hatching out being as yet incapable of attacking the firm substance of the cotyledons masticates the delicate feltlike layer at the base of the cup and is nourished by its juices but as the acorn matures this layer becomes more solid in its consistency the soft tissues harden the moist tissues dry up there is a period during which the acorn fulfils to perfection the conditions most conducive to the welfare of the grub at an earlier period matters would not have reached the desired stage at a later period the acorn would be too mature the exterior of the acorn gives no indication whatever of the progress of this internal cookery in order not to inflict unsuitable food on the grub the mother beetle not sufficiently informed by the look of the acorn is thus obliged to taste at the end of her trunk the tissues at the base of the cup the nurse before giving her charge a spoonful of broth tests it by tasting it in the same way the mother beetle plunges her trunk into the base of the cup to test the contents before bestowing them upon her offspring if the food is recognised as being satisfactory the egg is laid if not the perforation is abandoned without more ado this explains the perforations which serve no purpose in spite of so much labour the tissues at the base of the cup being carefully tested are not found to be in the required condition the elephantbeetles are difficult to please and take infinite pains when the first mouthful of the grub is in question to place the egg in a position where the newborn grub will find light and juicy and easily digested nutriment is not enough for those farseeing mothers their cares look beyond this point an intermediary period is desirable which will lead the little larva from the delicacies of its first hours to the diet of hard acorn this intermediary period is passed in the gallery the work of the maternal beak there it finds the crumbs the shavings bitten off by the chisels of the rostrum moreover the walls of the tunnel which are softened by mortification are better suited than the rest of the acorn to the tender mandibles of the larva before setting to work on the cotyledons the grub does in fact commence upon the contents and walls of this tiny passage it first consumes the shavings lying loose in the passage it devours the brown fragments adhering to the walls finally being now sufficiently strengthened it attacks the body of the acorn plunges into it and disappears the stomach is ready the rest is a blissful feast this intermediary tunnel must be of a certain length in order to satisfy the needs of infancy so the mother must labour at the work of drilling if the perforation were made solely with the purpose of tasting the material at the base of the acorn and recognising its degree of maturity the operation might be very much shorter since the hole could be sunk through the cup itself from a point close to the base this fact is not unrecognised i have on occasion found the insect perforating the scaly cup in such a proceeding i see the attempt of a gravid mother pressed for time to obtain prompt information if the acorn is suitable the boring will be recommenced at a more distant point through the surface of the acorn itself when an egg is to be laid the rule is to bore the hole from a point as distant as is practicable from the baseas far in short as the length of the rostrum will permit what is the object of this long perforation which often occupies more than half the day why this tenacious perseverance when not far from the stalk at the cost of much less time and fatigue the rostrum could attain the desired pointthe living spring from which the newborn grub is to drink the mother has her own reasons for toiling in this manner in doing thus she still attains the necessary point the base of the acorn and at the same timea most valuable resultshe prepares for the grub a long tube of fine easily digested meal but these are trivialities not so if you please but high and important matters speaking to us of the infinite pains which preside over the preservation of the least of things witnesses of a superior logic which regulates the smallest details the balaninus so happily inspired as a mother has her place in the world and is worthy of notice so at least thinks the blackbird which gladly makes a meal of the insect with the long beak when fruits grow rare at the end of autumn it makes a small mouthful but a tasty and is a pleasant change after such olives as yet withstand the cold and what without the blackbird and its rivalry of song were the reawakening of the woods in spring were man to disappear annihilated by his own foolish errors the festival of the lifebringing season would be no less worthily observed celebrated by the fluting of the yellowbilled songster to the meritorious rle of regaling the blackbird the minstrel of the forest the balaninus adds anotherthat of moderating the superfluity of vegetation like all the mighty who are worthy of their strength the oak is generous it produces acorns by the bushel what could the earth do with such prodigality the forest would stifle itself for want of room excess would ruin the necessary but no sooner is this abundance of food produced than there is an influx from every side of consumers only too eager to abate this inordinate production the fieldmouse a native of the woods stores acorns in a gravelheap near its haylined nest a stranger the jay comes in flocks from far away warned i know not how for some weeks it flies feasting from oak to oak giving vent to its joys and its emotions in a voice like that of a strangling cat then its mission accomplished it returns to the north whence it came the balaninus has anticipated them all the mother confided her eggs to the acorns while yet they were green these have now fallen to earth brown before their time and pierced by a round hole through which the larva has escaped after devouring the contents under one single oak a basket might easily be filled with these ruined shells more than the jay more than the fieldmouse the elephantbeetle has contributed to reduce the superfluity of acorns presently man arrives busied in the interest of his pig in my village it is quite an important event when the municipal hoardings announce the day for opening the municipal woods for the gathering of acorns the more zealous visit the woods the day before and select the best places next day at daybreak the whole family is there the father beats the upper branches with a pole the mother wearing a heavy hempen apron which enables her to force her way through the stubborn undergrowth gathers those within reach of the hand while the children collect those scattered upon the ground first the small baskets are filled then the big corbeilles and then the sacks after the fieldmouse the jay the weevil and so many others have taken toll comes man calculating how many pounds of baconfat his harvest will be worth one regret mingles with the cheer of the occasion it is to see so many acorns scattered on the ground which are pierced spoiled good for nothing and man curses the author of this destruction to hear him you would think the forest is meant for him alone and that the oaks bear acorns only for the sake of his pig my friend i would say to him the forest guard cannot take legal proceedings against the offender and it is just as well for our egoism which is inclined to see in the acorn only a garland of sausages would have annoying results the oak calls the whole world to enjoy its fruits we take the larger part because we are the stronger that is our only right more important than our rights is the equitable division of the fruits of the earth between the various consumers great and little all of whom play their part in this world if it is good that the blackbird should flute and rejoice in the burgeoning of the spring then it is no bad thing that acorns should be wormeaten in the acorn the dessert of the blackbird is prepared the balaninus the tasty mouthful that puts flesh upon his flanks and music into his throat let the blackbird sing and let us return to the eggs of the curculionid we know where the egg isat the base of the acorn because the tenderest and most juicy tissues of the fruit are there but how did it get there so far from the point of entry a very trifling question it is true puerile even if you will do not let us disdain to ask it science is made of these puerilities the first man to rub a piece of amber on his sleeve and to find that it thereupon attracted fragments of chaff had certainly no vision of the electric marvels of our days he was amusing himself in a childlike manner repeated tested and probed in every imaginable way the childs experiment has become one of the forces of the world the observer must neglect nothing for he never knows what may develop out of the humblest fact so again we will ask by what process did the egg of the elephantbeetle reach a point so far from the orifice in the acorn to one who was not already aware of the position of the egg but knew that the grub attacked the base of the acorn first the solution of that fact would be as follows the egg is laid at the entrance of the tunnel at the surface and the grub crawling down the gallery sunk by the mother gains of its own accord this distant point where its infant diet is to be found before i had sufficient data this was my own belief but the mistake was soon exposed i plucked an acorn just as the mother withdrew after having for a moment applied the tip of the abdomen to the orifice of the passage just opened by her rostrum the egg so it seemed must be there at the entrance of the passage but no it was not it was at the other extremity of the passage if i dared i would say it had dropped like a stone into a well that idea we must abandon at once the passage is extremely narrow and encumbered with shavings so that such a thing would be impossible moreover according to the direction of the stem accordingly as it pointed upwards or downwards the egg would have to fall downwards in one acorn and upwards in another a second explanation suggests itself not less perilous it might be said the cuckoo lays her egg on the grass no matter where she lifts it in her beak and places it in the nearest appropriate nest might not the balaninus follow an analogous method does she employ the rostrum to place the egg in its position at the base of the acorn i cannot see that the insect has any other implement capable of reaching this remote hidingplace nevertheless we must hastily reject such an absurd explanation as a last desperate resort the elephantbeetle certainly does not lay its egg in the open and seize it in its beak if it did so the delicate ovum would certainly be destroyed crushed in the attempt to thrust it down a narrow passage half choked with debris this is very perplexing my embarrassment will be shared by all readers who are acquainted with the structure of the elephantbeetle the grasshopper has a sabre an oviscapt which plunges into the earth and sows the eggs at the desired depth the leuscopis has a probe which finds its way through the masonry of the masonbee and lays the egg in the cocoon of the great somnolent larva but the balaninus has none of these swords daggers or pikes she has nothing but the tip of her abdomen yet she has only to apply that abdominal extremity to the opening of the passage and the egg is immediately lodged at the very bottom anatomy will give us the answer to the riddle which is otherwise indecipherable i open the body of a gravid female there before my eyes is something that takes my breath away there occupying the whole length of the body is an extraordinary device a red horny rigid rod i had almost said a rostrum so greatly does it resemble the implement which the insect carries on his head it is a tube fine as a horsehair slightly enlarged at the free extremity like an oldfashioned blunderbuss and expanding to form an eggshaped capsule at the point of origin this is the oviduct and its dimensions are the same as those of the rostrum as far as the perforating beak can plunge so far the oviscapt the interior rostrum will reach when working upon her acorn the female chooses the point of attack so that the two complementary instruments can each of them reach the desired point at the base of the acorn the matter now explains itself the work of drilling completed the gallery ready the mother turns and places the tip of the abdomen against the orifice she extrudes the internal mechanism which easily passes through the loose debris of the boring no sign of the probe appears so quickly and discreetly does it work nor is any trace of it to be seen when the egg having been properly deposited the implement ascends and returns to the abdomen it is over and the mother departs and we have not caught a glimpse of her internal mechanism was i not right to insist an apparently insignificant fact has led to the authentic proof of a fact that the larinid had already made me suspect the longbeaked weevils have an internal probe an abdominal rostrum which nothing in their external appearance betrays they possess among the hidden organs of the abdomen the counterpart of the grasshoppers sabre and the ichneumons dagger chapter xviii the peaweevilbruchus pisi peas are held in high esteem by mankind from remote ages man has endeavoured by careful culture to produce larger tenderer and sweeter varieties of an adaptable character under careful treatment the plant has evolved in a docile fashion and has ended by giving us what the ambition of the gardener desired today we have gone far beyond the yield of the varrons and columelles and further still beyond the original pea from the wild seeds confided to the soil by the first man who thought to scratch up the surface of the earth perhaps with the halfjaw of a cavebear whose powerful canine tooth would serve him as a ploughshare where is it this original pea in the world of spontaneous vegetation our own country has nothing resembling it is it to be found elsewhere on this point botany is silent or replies only with vague probabilities we find the same ignorance elsewhere on the subject of the majority of our alimentary vegetables whence comes wheat the blessed grain which gives us bread no one knows you will not find it here except in the care of man nor will you find it abroad in the east the birthplace of agriculture no botanist has ever encountered the sacred ear growing of itself on unbroken soil barley oats and rye the turnip and the beet the beetroot the carrot the pumpkin and so many other vegetable products leave us in the same perplexity their point of departure is unknown to us or at most suspected behind the impenetrable cloud of the centuries nature delivered them to us in the full vigour of the thing untamed when their value as food was indifferent as today she offers us the sloe the bullace the blackberry the crab she gave them to us in the state of imperfect sketches for us to fill out and complete it was for our skill and our labour patiently to induce the nourishing pulp which was the earliest form of capital whose interest is always increasing in the primordial bank of the tiller of the soil as storehouses of food the cereal and the vegetable are for the greater part the work of man the fundamental species a poor resource in their original state we borrowed as they were from the natural treasury of the vegetable world the perfected race rich in alimentary materials is the result of our art if wheat peas and all the rest are indispensable to us our care by a just return is absolutely necessary to them such as our needs have made them incapable of resistance in the bitter struggle for survival these vegetables left to themselves without culture would rapidly disappear despite the numerical abundance of their seeds as the foolish sheep would disappear were there no more sheepfolds they are our work but not always our exclusive property wherever food is amassed the consumers collect from the four corners of the sky they invite themselves to the feast of abundance and the richer the food the greater their numbers man who alone is capable of inducing agrarian abundance is by that very fact the giver of an immense banquet at which legions of feasters take their place by creating more juicy and more generous fruits he calls to his enclosures despite himself thousands and thousands of hungry creatures against whose appetites his prohibitions are helpless the more he produces the larger is the tribute demanded of him wholesale agriculture and vegetable abundance favour our rival the insect this is the immanent law nature with an equal zeal offers her mighty breast to all her nurslings alike to those who live by the goods of others no less than to the producers for us who plough sow and reap and weary ourselves with labour she ripens the wheat she ripens it also for the little calenderbeetle which although exempted from the labour of the fields enters our granaries none the less and there with its pointed beak nibbles our wheat grain by grain to the husk for us who dig weed and water bent with fatigue and burned by the sun she swells the pods of the pea she swells them also for the weevil which does no gardeners work yet takes its share of the harvest at its own hour when the earth is joyful with the new life of spring let us follow the manoeuvres of this insect which takes its tithe of the green pea i a benevolent ratepayer will allow it to take its dues it is precisely to benefit it that i have sown a few rows of the beloved plant in a corner of my garden without other invitation on my part than this modest expenditure of seedpeas it arrives punctually during the month of may it has learned that this stony soil rebellious to the culture of the kitchengardener is bearing peas for the first time in all haste therefore it has hurried an agent of the entomological revenue system to demand its dues whence does it come it is impossible to say precisely it has come from some shelter somewhere in which it has passed the winter in a state of torpor the planetree which sheds its rind during the heats of the summer furnishes an excellent refuge for homeless insects under its partly detached sheets of bark i have often found our weevil in such a winter refuge sheltered under the dead covering of the plane or otherwise protected while the winter lasts it awakens from its torpor at the first touch of a kindly sun the almanack of the instincts has aroused it it knows as well as the gardener when the peavines are in flower and seeks its favourite plant journeying thither from every side running with quick short steps or nimbly flying a small head a fine snout a costume of ashen grey sprinkled with brown flattened wingcovers a dumpy compact body with two large black dots on the rear segmentsuch is the summary portrait of my visitor the middle of may approaches and with it the van of the invasion they settle on the flowers which are not unlike whitewinged butterflies i see them at the base of the blossom or inside the cavity of the keel of the flower but the majority explore the petals and take possession of them the time for laying the eggs has not yet arrived the morning is mild the sun is warm without being oppressive it is the moment of nuptial flights the time of rejoicing in the splendour of the sunshine everywhere are creatures rejoicing to be alive couples come together part and reform when towards noon the heat becomes too great the weevils retire into the shadow taking refuge singly in the folds of the flowers whose secret corners they know so well tomorrow will be another day of festival and the next day also until the pods emerging from the shelter of the keel of the flower are plainly visible enlarging from day to day a few gravid females more pressed for time than the others confide their eggs to the growing pod flat and meagre as it issues from its floral sheath these hastily laid batches of eggs expelled perhaps by the exigencies of an ovary incapable of further delay seem to me in serious danger for the seed in which the grub must establish itself is as yet no more than a tender speck of green without firmness and without any farinaceous tissue no larva could possible find sufficient nourishment there unless it waited for the pea to mature but is the grub capable of fasting for any length of time when once hatched it is doubtful the little i have seen tells me that the newborn grub must establish itself in the midst of its food as quickly as possible and that it perishes unless it can do so i am therefore of opinion that such eggs as are deposited in immature pods are lost however the race will hardly suffer by such a loss so fertile is the little beetle we shall see directly how prodigal the female is of her eggs the majority of which are destined to perish the important part of the maternal task is completed by the end of may when the shells are swollen by the expanding peas which have reached their final growth or are but little short of it i was anxious to see the female bruchus at work in her quality of curculionid as our classification declares her8 the other weevils are rhyncophora beaked insects armed with a drill with which to prepare the hole in which the egg is laid the bruchus possesses only a short snout or muzzle excellently adapted for eating soft tissues but valueless as a drill the method of installing the family is consequently absolutely different there are no industrious preparations as with the balinid the larinid and the rhynchitides not being equipped with a long oviscapt the mother sows her eggs in the open with no protection against the heat of the sun and the variations of temperature nothing could be simpler and nothing more perilous to the eggs in the absence of special characteristics which would enable them to resist the alternate trials of heat and cold moisture and drought in the caressing sunlight of ten oclock in the morning the mother runs up and down the chosen pod first on one side then on the other with a jerky capricious unmethodical gait she repeatedly extrudes a short oviduct which oscillates right and left as though to graze the skin of the pod an egg follows which is abandoned as soon as laid a hasty touch of the oviduct first here then there on the green skin of the peapod and that is all the egg is left there unprotected in the full sunlight no choice of position is made such as might assist the grub when it seeks to penetrate its larder some eggs are laid on the swellings created by the peas beneath others in the barren valleys which separate them the first are close to the peas the second at some distance from them in short the eggs of the bruchus are laid at random as though on the wing we observe a still more serious vice the number of eggs is out of all proportion to the number of peas in the pod let us note at the outset that each grub requires one pea it is the necessary ration and is largely sufficient to one larva but is not enough for several nor even for two one pea to each grub neither more nor less is the unchangeable rule we should expect to find signs of a procreative economy which would impel the female to take into account the number of peas contained in the pod which she has just explored we might expect her to set a numerical limit on her eggs in conformity with that of the peas available but no such limit is observed the rule of one pea to one grub is always contradicted by the multiplicity of consumers my observations are unanimous on this point the number of eggs deposited on one pod always exceeds the number of peas available and often to a scandalous degree however meagre the contents of the pod there is a superabundance of consumers dividing the sum of the eggs upon such or such a pod by that of the peas contained therein i find there are five to eight claimants for each pea i have found ten and there is no reason why this prodigality should not go still further many are called but few are chosen what is to become of all these supernumeraries perforce excluded from the banquet for want of space the eggs are of a fairly bright amber yellow cylindrical in form smooth and rounded at the ends their length is at most a twentyfifth of an inch each is affixed to the pod by means of a slight network of threads of coagulated albumen neither wind nor rain can loosen their hold the mother not infrequently emits them two at a time one above the other not infrequently also the uppermost of the two eggs hatches before the other while the latter fades and perishes what was lacking to this egg that it should fail to produce a grub perhaps a bath of sunlight the incubating heat of which the outer egg has robbed it whether on account of the fact that it is shadowed by the other egg or for other reasons the elder of the eggs in a group of two rarely follows the normal course but perishes on the pod dead without having lived there are exceptions to this premature end sometimes the two eggs develop equally well but such cases are exceptional so that the bruchid family would be reduced to about half its dimensions if the binary system were the rule to the detriment of our peas and to the advantage of the beetle the eggs are commonly laid one by one and in isolation a recent emergence is shown by a little sinuous ribbonlike mark pale or whitish where the skin of the pod is raised and withered which starts from the egg and is the work of the newborn larva a subepidermic tunnel along which the grub works its way while seeking a point from which it can escape into a pea this point once attained the larva which is scarcely a twentyfifth of an inch in length and is white with a black head perforates the envelope and plunges into the capacious hollow of the pod it has reached the peas and crawls upon the nearest i have observed it with the magnifier having explored the green globe its new world it begins to sink a well perpendicularly into the sphere i have often seen it halfway in wriggling its tail in the effort to work the quicker in a short time the grub disappears and is at home the point of entry minute but always easily recognisable by its brown coloration on the pale green background of the pea has no fixed location it may be at almost any point on the surface of the pea but an exception is usually made of the lower half that is the hemisphere whose pole is formed by the supporting stem it is precisely in this portion that the germ is found which will not be eaten by the larva and will remain capable of developing into a plant in spite of the large aperture made by the emergence of the adult insect why is this particular portion left untouched what are the motives that safeguard the germ it goes without saying that the bruchus is not considering the gardener the pea is meant for it and for no one else in refusing the few bites that would lead to the death of the seed it has no intention of limiting its destruction it abstains from other motives let us remark that the peas touch laterally and are pressed one against the other so that the grub when searching for a point of attack cannot circulate at will let us also note that the lower pole expands into the umbilical excrescence which is less easy of perforation than those parts protected by the skin alone it is even possible that the umbilicum whose organisation differs from that of the rest of the pea contains a peculiar sap that is distasteful to the little grub such doubtless is the reason why the peas exploited by the bruchus are still able to germinate they are damaged but not dead because the invasion was conducted from the free hemisphere a portion less vulnerable and more easy of access moreover as the pea in its entirety is too large for a single grub to consume the consumption is limited to the portion preferred by the consumer and this portion is not the essential portion of the pea with other conditions with very much smaller or very much larger seeds we shall observe very different results if too small the germ will perish gnawed like the rest by the insufficiently provisioned inmate if too large the abundance of food will permit of several inmates exploited in the absence of the pea the cultivated vetch and the broad bean afford us an excellent example the smaller seed of which all but the skin is devoured is left incapable of germination but the large bean even though it may have held a number of grubs is still capable of sprouting knowing that the pod always exhibits a number of eggs greatly in excess of the enclosed peas and that each pea is the exclusive property of one grub we naturally ask what becomes of the superfluous grubs do they perish outside when the more precocious have one by one taken their places in their vegetable larder or do they succumb to the intolerant teeth of the first occupants neither explanation is correct let us relate the facts on all old peasthey are at this stage dryfrom which the adult bruchus has emerged leaving a large round hole of exit the magnifyingglass will show a variable number of fine reddish punctuations perforated in the centre what are these spots of which i count five six and even more on a single pea it is impossible to be mistaken they are the points of entry of as many grubs several grubs have entered the pea but of the whole group only one has survived fattened and attained the adult age and the others we shall see at the end of may and in june the period of egglaying let us inspect the still green and tender peas nearly all the peas invaded show us the multiple perforations already observed on the dry peas abandoned by the weevils does this actually mean that there are several grubs in the pea yes skin the peas in question separate the cotyledons and break them up as may be necessary we shall discover several grubs extremely youthful curled up commawise fat and lively each in a little round niche in the body of the pea peace and welfare seem to reign in the little community there is no quarrelling no jealousy between neighbours the feast has commenced food is abundant and the feasters are separated one from another by the walls of uneaten substance with this isolation in separate cells no conflicts need be feared no sudden bite of the mandibles whether intentional or accidental all the occupants enjoy the same rights of property the same appetite and the same strength how does this communal feast terminate having first opened them i place a number of peas which are found to be well peopled in a glass testtube i open others daily in this way i keep myself informed as to the progress of the various larv at first nothing noteworthy is to be seen isolated in its narrow chamber each grub nibbles the substance around it peacefully and parsimoniously it is still very small a mere speck of food is a feast but the contents of one pea will not suffice the whole number to the end famine is ahead and all but one must perish soon indeed the aspect of things is entirely changed one of the grubsthat which occupies the central position in the peabegins to grow more quickly than the others scarcely has it surpassed the others in size when the latter cease to eat and no longer attempt to burrow forwards they lie motionless and resigned they die that gentle death which comes to unconscious lives henceforth the entire pea belongs to the sole survivor now what has happened that these lives around the privileged one should be thus annihilated in default of a satisfactory reply i will propose a suggestion in the centre of the pea less ripened than the rest of the seed by the chemistry of the sun may there not be a softer pulp of a quality better adapted to the infantile digestion of the grub there perhaps being nourished by tenderer sweeter and perhaps more tasty tissues the stomach becomes more vigorous until it is fit to undertake less easily digested food a nursling is fed on milk before proceeding to bread and broth may not the central portion of the pea be the feedingbottle of the bruchid with equal rights fired by an equal ambition all the occupants of the pea bore their way towards the delicious morsel the journey is laborious and the grubs must rest frequently in their provisional niches they rest while resting they frugally gnaw the riper tissues surrounding them they gnaw rather to open a way than to fill their stomachs finally one of the excavators favoured by the direction taken attains the central portion it establishes itself there and all is over the others have only to die how are they warned that the place is taken do they hear their brother gnawing at the walls of his lodging can they feel the vibration set up by his nibbling mandibles something of the kind must happen for from that moment they make no attempt to burrow further without struggling against the fortunate winner without seeking to dislodge him those which are beaten in the race give themselves up to death i admire this candid resignation on the part of the departed another conditionthat of spaceis also present as a factor the peaweevil is the largest of our bruchid when it attains the adult stage it requires a certain amplitude of lodging which the other weevils do not require in the same degree a pea provides it with a sufficiently spacious cell nevertheless the cohabitation of two in one pea would be impossible there would be no room even were the two to put up with a certain discomfort hence the necessity of an inevitable decimation which will suppress all the competitors save one now the superior volume of the broad bean which is almost as much beloved by the weevil as the pea can lodge a considerable community and the solitary can live as a cenobite without encroaching on the domain of their neighbours five or six or more can find room in the one bean moreover each grub can find its infant diet that is that layer which remote from the surface hardens only gradually and remains full of sap until a comparatively late period this inner layer represents the crumb of a loaf the rest of the bean being the crust in the pea a sphere of much less capacity it occupies the central portion a limited point at which the grub develops and lacking which it perishes but in the bean it lines the wide adjoining faces of the two flattened cotyledons no matter where the point of attack is made the grub has only to bore straight down when it quickly reaches the softer tissues what is the result i have counted the eggs adhering to a beanpod and the beans included in the pod and comparing the two figures i find that there is plenty of room for the whole family at the rate of five or six dwellers in each bean no superfluous larv perish of hunger when barely issued from the egg all have their share of the ample provision all live and prosper the abundance of food balances the prodigal fertility of the mother if the bruchus were always to adopt the broad bean for the establishment of her family i could well understand the exuberant allowance of eggs to one pod a rich foodstuff easily obtained evokes a large batch of eggs but the case of the pea perplexes me by what aberration does the mother abandon her children to starvation on this totally insufficient vegetable why so many grubs to each pea when one pea is sufficient only for one grub matters are not so arranged in the general balancesheet of life a certain foresight seems to rule over the ovary so that the number of mouths is in proportion to the abundance or scarcity of the food consumed the scarabus the sphex the necrophorus and other insects which prepare and preserve alimentary provision for their families are all of a narrowly limited fertility because the balls of dung the dead or paralysed insects or the buried corpses of animals on which their offspring are nourished are provided only at the cost of laborious efforts the ordinary bluebottle on the contrary which lays her eggs upon butchers meat or carrion lays them in enormous batches trusting in the inexhaustible riches represented by the corpse she is prodigal of offspring and takes no account of numbers in other cases the provision is acquired by audacious brigandage which exposes the newly born offspring to a thousand mortal accidents in such cases the mother balances the chances of destruction by an exaggerated flux of eggs such is the case with the meloides which stealing the goods of others under conditions of the greatest peril are accordingly endowed with a prodigious fertility the bruchus knows neither the fatigues of the laborious obliged to limit the size of her family nor the misfortunes of the parasite obliged to produce an exaggerated number of offspring without painful search entirely at her ease merely moving in the sunshine over her favourite plant she can ensure a sufficient provision for each of her offspring she can do so yet is foolish enough to overpopulate the pod of the pea a nursery insufficiently provided in which the great majority will perish of starvation this ineptitude is a thing i cannot understand it clashes too completely with the habitual foresight of the maternal instinct i am inclined to believe that the pea is not the original food plant of the bruchus the original plant must rather have been the bean one seed of which is capable of supporting half a dozen or more larv with the larger cotyledon the crying disproportion between the number of eggs and the available provision disappears moreover it is indubitable that the bean is of earlier date than the pea its exceptional size and its agreeable flavour would certainly have attracted the attention of man from the remotest periods the bean is a readymade mouthful and would be of the greatest value to the hungry tribe primitive man would at an early date have sown it beside his wattled hut coming from central asia by long stages their wagons drawn by shaggy oxen and rolling on the circular discs cut from the trunks of trees the early immigrants would have brought to our virgin land first the bean then the pea and finally the cereal that best of safeguards against famine they taught us the care of herds and the use of bronze the material of the first metal implement thus the dawn of civilisation arose over france with the bean did those ancient teachers also involuntarily bring us the insect which today disputes it with us it is doubtful the bruchid seem to be indigenous at all events i find them levying tribute from various indigenous plants wild vegetables which have never tempted the appetite of man they abound in particular upon the great forest vetch lathyrus latifolius with its magnificent heads of flowers and long handsome pods the seeds are not large being indeed smaller than the garden pea but eaten to the very skin as they invariably are each is sufficient to the needs of its grub we must not fail to note their number i have counted more than twenty in a single pod a number unknown in the case of the pea even in the most prolific varieties consequently this superb vetch is in general able to nourish without much loss the family confided to its pod where the forest vetch is lacking the bruchus none the less bestows its habitual prodigality of eggs upon another vegetable of similar flavour but incapable of nourishing all the grubs for the example the travelling vetch vicia peregrina or the cultivated vetch vicia sativa the number of eggs remains high even upon insufficient pods because the original foodplant offered a copious provision both in the multiplicity and the size of the seeds if the bruchus is really a stranger let us regard the bean as the original foodplant if indigenous the large vetch sometime in the remote past we received the pea growing it at first in the prehistoric vegetable garden which already supplied the bean it was found a better article of diet than the broad bean which today after such good service is comparatively neglected the weevil was of the same opinion as man and without entirely forgetting the bean and the vetch it established the greater part of its tribe upon the pea which from century to century was more widely cultivated today we have to share our peas the bruchid take what they need and bestow their leavings on us this prosperity of the insect which is the offspring of the abundance and quality of our garden products is from another point of view equivalent to decadence for the weevil as for ourselves progress in matters of food and drink is not always beneficial the race would profit better if it remained frugal on the bean and the vetch the bruchus founded colonies in which the infant mortality was low there was room for all on the peavine delicious though its fruits may be the greater part of its offspring die of starvation the rations are few and the hungry mouths are multitudinous we will linger over this problem no longer let us observe the grub which has now become the sole tenant of the pea by the death of its brothers it has had no part in their death chance has favoured it that is all in the centre of the pea a wealthy solitude it performs the duty of a grub the sole duty of eating it nibbles the walls enclosing it enlarging its lodgment which is always entirely filled by its corpulent body it is well shaped fat and shining with health if i disturb it it turns gently in its niche and sways its head this is its manner of complaining of my importunities let us leave it in peace it profits so greatly and so swiftly by its position that by the time the dogdays have come it is already preparing for its approaching liberation the adult is not sufficiently well equipped to open for itself a way out through the pea which is now completely hardened the larva knows of this future helplessness and with consummate art provides for its release with its powerful mandibles it bores a channel of exit exactly round with extremely cleancut sides the most skilful ivorycarver could do no better to prepare the door of exit in advance is not enough the grub must also provide for the tranquillity essential to the delicate processes of nymphosis an intruder might enter by the open door and injure the helpless nymph this passage must therefore remain closed but how as the grub bores the passage of exit it consumes the farinaceous matter without leaving a crumb having come to the skin of the pea it stops short this membrane semitranslucid is the door to the chamber of metamorphosis its protection against the evil intentions of external creatures it is also the only obstacle which the adult will encounter at the moment of exit to lessen the difficulty of opening it the grub takes the precaution of gnawing at the inner side of the skin all round the circumference so as to make a line of least resistance the perfect insect will only have to heave with its shoulder and strike a few blows with its head in order to raise the circular door and knock it off like the lid of a box the passage of exit shows through the diaphanous skin of the pea as a large circular spot which is darkened by the obscurity of the interior what passes behind it is invisible hidden as it is behind a sort of ground glass window a pretty invention this little closed porthole this barricade against the invader this trapdoor raised by a push when the time has come for the hermit to enter the world shall we credit it to the bruchus did the ingenious insect conceive the undertaking did it think out a plan and work out a scheme of its own devising this would be no small triumph for the brain of a weevil before coming to a conclusion let us try an experiment i deprive certain occupied peas of their skin and i dry them with abnormal rapidity placing them in glass testtubes the grubs prosper as well as in the intact peas at the proper time the preparations for emergence are made if the grub acts on its own inspiration if it ceases to prolong its boring directly it recognises that the outer coating auscultated from time to time is sufficiently thin what will it do under the conditions of the present test feeling itself at the requisite distance from the surface it will stop boring it will respect the outer layer of the bare pea and will thus obtain the indispensable protecting screen nothing of the kind occurs in every case the passage is completely excavated the entrance gapes wide open as large and as carefully executed as though the skin of the pea were in its place reasons of security have failed to modify the usual method of work this open lodging has no defence against the enemy but the grub exhibits no anxiety on this score neither is it thinking of the outer enemy when it bores down to the skin when the pea is intact and then stops short it suddenly stops because the innutritious skin is not to its taste we ourselves remove the parchmentlike skins from a mess of peasepudding as from a culinary point of view they are so much waste matter the larva of the bruchus like ourselves dislikes the skin of the pea it stops short at the horny covering simply because it is checked by an uneatable substance from this aversion a little miracle arises but the insect has no sense of logic it is passively obedient to the superior logic of facts it obeys its instinct as unconscious of its act as is a crystal when it assembles in exquisite order its battalions of atoms sooner or later during the month of august we see a shadowy circle form on each inhabited pea but only one on each seed these circles of shadow mark the doors of exit most of them open in september the lid as though cut out with a punch detaches itself cleanly and falls to the ground leaving the orifice free the bruchus emerges freshly clad in its final form the weather is delightful flowers are abundant awakened by the summer showers and the weevils visit them in the lovely autumn weather then when the cold sets in they take up their winter quarters in any suitable retreat others still numerous are less hasty in quitting the native seed they remain within during the whole winter sheltered behind the trapdoor which they take care not to touch the door of the cell will not open on its hinges or to be exact will not yield along the line of least resistance until the warm days return then the late arrivals will leave their shelter and rejoin the more impatient and both will be ready for work when the peavines are in flower to take a general view of the instincts in their inexhaustible variety is for the observer the great attraction of the entomological world for nowhere do we gain a clearer sight of the wonderful way in which the processes of life are ordered thus regarded entomology is not i know to the taste of everybody the simple creature absorbed in the doings and habits of insects is held in low esteem to the terrible utilitarian a bushel of peas preserved from the weevil is of more importance than a volume of observations which bring no immediate profit yet who has told you o man of little faith that what is useless today will not be useful tomorrow if we learn the customs of insects or animals we shall understand better how to protect our goods do not despise disinterested knowledge or you may rue the day it is by the accumulation of ideas whether immediately applicable or otherwise that humanity has done and will continue to do better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than today if we live on peas and beans which we dispute with the weevil we also live by knowledge that mighty kneadingtrough in which the bread of progress is mixed and leavened knowledge is well worth a few beans among other things knowledge tells us the seedsman need not go to the expense of waging war upon the weevil when the peas arrive in the granary the harm is already done it is irreparable but not transmissible the untouched peas have nothing to fear from the neighbourhood of those which have been attacked however long the mixture is left from the latter the weevils will issue when their time has come they will fly away from the storehouse if escape is possible if not they will perish without in any way attacking the sound peas no eggs no new generation will ever be seen upon or within the dried peas in the storehouse there the adult weevil can work no further mischief the bruchus is not a sedentary inhabitant of granaries it requires the open air the sun the liberty of the fields frugal in everything it absolutely disdains the hard tissues of the vegetable its tiny mouth is content with a few honeyed mouthfuls enjoyed upon the flowers the larv on the other hand require the tender tissues of the green pea growing in the pod for these reasons the granary knows no final multiplication on the part of the despoiler the origin of the evil is in the kitchengarden it is there that we ought to keep a watch on the misdeeds of the bruchus were it not for the fact that we are nearly always weaponless when it comes to fighting an insect indestructible by reason of its numbers its small size and its cunning the little creature laughs at the anger of man the gardener curses it but the weevil is not disturbed it imperturbably continues its trade of levying tribute happily we have assistants more patient and more clearsighted than ourselves during the first week of august when the mature bruchus begins to emerge i notice a little chalcidian the protector of our peas in my rearingcages it issues under my eyes in abundance from the peas infested by the grub of the weevil the female has a reddish head and thorax the abdomen is black with a long augurlike oviscapt the male a little smaller is black both sexes have reddish claws and threadlike antenn in order to escape from the pea the slayer of the weevil makes an opening in the centre of the circular trapdoor which the grub of the weevil prepared in view of its future deliverance the slain has prepared the way for the slayer after this detail the rest may be divined when the preliminaries to the metamorphosis are completed when the passage of escape is bored and furnished with its lid of superficial membrane the female chalcidian arrives in a busy mood she inspects the peas still on the vine and enclosed in their pods she auscultates them with her antenn she discovers hidden under the general envelope the weak points in the epidermic covering of the peas then applying her oviscapt she thrusts it through the side of the pod and perforates the circular trapdoor however far withdrawn into the centre of the pea the bruchus whether larv or nymph is reached by the long oviduct it receives an egg in its tender flesh and the thing is done without possibility of defence since it is by now a somnolent grub or a helpless pupa the embryo weevil is eaten until nothing but skin remains what a pity that we cannot at will assist the multiplication of this eager exterminator alas our assistants have got us in a vicious circle for if we wished to obtain the help of any great number of chalcidians we should be obliged in the first place to breed a multiplicity of bruchid chapter xix an invaderthe haricotweevil if there is one vegetable on earth that more than any other is a gift of the gods it is the haricot bean it has all the virtues it forms a soft paste upon the tongue it is extremely palatable abundant inexpensive and highly nutritious it is a vegetable meat which without being bloody and repulsive is the equivalent of the horrors outspread upon the butchers slab to recall its services the more emphatically the provenal idiom calls it the gounflogusthe filler of the poor blessed bean consoler of the wretched right well indeed do you fill the labourer the honest skilful worker who has drawn a low number in the crazy lottery of life kindly haricot with three drops of oil and a dash of vinegar you were the favourite dish of my young years and even now in the evening of my days you are welcome to my humble porringer we shall be friends to the last today it is not my intention to sing your merits i wish simply to ask you a question being curious what is the country of your origin did you come from central asia with the broad bean and the pea did you make part of that collection of seeds which the first pioneers of culture brought us from their gardens were you known to antiquity here the insect an impartial and wellinformed witness answers no in our country antiquity was not acquainted with the haricot the precious vegetable came hither by the same road as the broad bean it is a foreigner and of comparatively recent introduction into europe the reply of the insect merits serious examination supported as it is by extremely plausible arguments here are the facts for years attentive to matters agricultural i had never seen haricots attacked by any insect whatever not even by the bruchid the licensed robbers of leguminous seeds on this point i have questioned my peasant neighbours they are men of the extremest vigilance in all that concerns their crops to steal their property is an abominable crime swiftly discovered moreover the housewife who individually examines all beans intended for the saucepan would inevitably find the malefactor all those i have spoken to replied to my questions with a smile in which i read their lack of faith in my knowledge of insects sir they said you must know that there are never grubs in the haricot bean it is a blessed vegetable respected by the weevil the pea the broad bean the vetch and the chickpea all have their vermin but the haricot lou gounflogus never what should we do poor folk as we are if the courcoussoun robbed us of it the fact is that the weevil despises the haricot a very curious dislike if we consider how industriously the other vegetables of the same family are attacked all even the beggarly lentil are eagerly exploited whilst the haricot so tempting both as to size and flavour remains untouched it is incomprehensible why should the bruchus which without hesitation passes from the excellent to the indifferent and from the indifferent to the excellent disdain this particularly toothsome seed it leaves the forest vetch for the pea and the pea for the broad bean as pleased with the small as with the large yet the temptations of the haricot bean leave it indifferent why apparently because the haricot is unknown to it the other leguminous plants whether native or of oriental origin have been familiar to it for centuries it has tested their virtues year by year and confiding in the lessons of the past it bases its forethought for the future upon ancient custom the haricot is avoided as a newcomer whose merits it has not yet learned the insect emphatically informs us that with us the haricot is of recent date it has come to us from a distant country and assuredly from the new world every edible vegetable attracts its consumers if it had originated in the old world the haricot would have had its licensed consumers as have the pea the lentil and the broad bean the smallest leguminous seed if barely bigger than a pins head nourishes its weevil a dwarf which patiently nibbles it and excavates a dwelling but the plump delicious haricot is spared this astonishing immunity can have only one explanation like the potato and the maizeplant the haricot is a gift of the new world it arrived in europe without the company of the insect which exploits it in its native country it has found in our fields another world of insects which have despised it because they did not know it similarly the potato and the ear of maize are untouched in france unless their american consumers are accidentally imported with them the verdict of the insect is confirmed by the negative testimony of the ancient classics the haricot never appears on the table of the greek or roman peasant in the second eclogue of virgil thestylis prepares the repast of the harvesters thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus stu allia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentes this mixture is the equivalent of the aoli dear to the provenal palate it sounds very well in verse but is not very substantial on such an occasion men would look for that fundamental dish the plate of red haricots seasoned with chopped onions all in good time this at least would ballast the stomach thus refreshed in the open air listening to the song of the cigales the gang of harvesters would take their midday rest and gently digest their meal in the shadows of the sheaves our modern thestylis differing little from her classic sister would take good care not to forget the gounflogus that economical resource of large appetites the thestylis of the past did not think of providing it because she did not know it the same author shows us tityrus offering a nights hospitality to his friend meliboeus who has been driven from his property by the soldiers of octavius and goes limping behind his flock of goats we shall have says tityrus chestnuts cheese and fruits history does not say if meliboeus allowed himself to be tempted it is a pity for during the frugal meal we might have learned in a more explicit fashion that the shepherds of the ancient world were not acquainted with the haricot ovid tells us in a delightful passage of the manner in which philemon and baucis received the gods unawares as guests in their humble cottage on the threelegged table which was levelled by means of a potsherd under one of the legs they served cabbage soup rusty bacon eggs poached for a minute in the hot cinders cornelberries pickled in brine honey and fruits in this rustic abundance one dish was lacking an essential dish which the baucis of our countryside would never forget after bacon soup would follow the obligatory plate of haricots why did ovid so prodigal of detail neglect to mention a dish so appropriate to the occasion the reply is the same as before because he did not know of it in vain have i recapitulated all that my reading has taught me concerning the rustic dietary of ancient times i can recollect no mention of the haricot the worker in the vineyard and the harvester have their lupins broad beans peas and lentils but never the bean of beans the haricot the haricot has a reputation of another kind it is a source of flatulence you eat it as the saying is and then you take a walk it lends itself to the gross pleasantries loved of the populace especially when they are formulated by the shameless genius of an aristophanes or a plautus what merriment over a simple allusion to the sonorous bean what guffaws from the throats of athenian sailors or roman porters did the two masters in the unfettered gaiety of a language less reserved than our own ever mention the virtues of the haricot no they are absolutely silent concerning the trumpetvoiced vegetable the name of the bean is a matter for reflection it is of an unfamiliar sound having no affinity with our language by its unlikeness to our native combinations of sounds it makes one think of the west indies or south america as do caoutchouc and cacao does the word as a matter of fact come from the american indians did we receive together with the vegetable the name by which it is known in its native country perhaps but how are we to know haricot fantastic haricot you set us a curious philological problem it is also known in french as fasole or flageolet the provenal calls it faio and favio the catalan fayol the spaniard faseolo the portuguese feyo the italian fagiuolo here i am on familiar ground the languages of the latin family have preserved with the inevitable modifications the ancient word faseolus now if i consult my dictionary i find faselus faseolus phaseolus haricot learned lexicographer permit me to remark that your translation is incorrect faselus faseolus cannot mean haricot the incontestable proof is in the georgics where virgil tells us at what season we must sow the faselus he says si vero viciamque seres vilemque faselum haud obscura cadens mittet tibi signa bootes incipe et ad medias sementem extende pruinas nothing is clearer than the precept of the poet who was so admirably familiar with all matters agricultural the sowing of the faselus must be commenced when the constellation of bootes disappears at the set of sun that is in october and it is to be continued until the middle of the winter these conditions put the haricot out of the running it is a delicate plant which would never survive the lightest frost winter would be fatal to it even under italian skies more refractory to cold on account of the country of their origin peas broad beans and vetches and other leguminous plants have nothing to fear from an autumn sowing and prosper during the winter provided the climate be fairly mild what then is represented by the faselus of the georgics that problematical vegetable which has transmitted its name to the haricot in the latin tongues remembering that the contemptuous epithet vilis is used by the poet in qualification i am strongly inclined to regard it as the cultivated vetch the big square pea the littlevalued jasso of the provenal peasant the problem of the haricot stood thus almost elucidated by the testimony of the insect world alone when an unexpected witness gave me the last word of the enigma it was once again a poet and a famous poet m josmaria de heredia who came to the aid of the naturalist without suspecting the service he was rendering a friend of mine the village schoolmaster lent me a magazine9 in which i read the following conversation between the mastersonneteer and a lady journalist who was anxious to know which of his own works he preferred what would you have me say said the poet i do not know what to say i do not know which sonnet i prefer i have taken horrible pains with all of them but you which do you prefer my dear master how can i choose out of so many jewels when each one is perfect in its beauty you flash pearls emeralds and rubies before my astonished eyes how should i decide to prefer the emerald to the pearl i am transported by admiration of the whole necklace well as for me there is something i am more proud of than of all my sonnets and which has done much more for my reputation than my verses i opened my eyes wide what is that i asked the master looked at me mischievously then with that beautiful light in his eyes which fires his youthful countenance he said triumphantly it is my discovery of the etymology of the word haricot i was so amazed that i forgot to laugh i am perfectly serious in telling you this i know my dear master of your reputation for profound scholarship but to imagine on that account that you were famed for your discovery of the etymology of haricoti should never have expected it will you tell me how you made the discovery willingly see now i found some information respecting the haricot while studying that fine seventeenthcentury work of natural history by hernandez de historia plantarum novi orbis the word haricot was unknown in france until the seventeenth century people used the word feve or phasol in mexican ayacot thirty species of haricot were cultivated in mexico before the conquest they are still known as ayacot especially the red haricot spotted with black or violet one day at the house of gaston paris i met a famous scholar hearing my name he rushed at me and asked if it was i who had discovered the etymology of the word haricot he was absolutely ignorant of the fact that i had written verses and published the trophes a very pretty whim to count the jewellery of his famous sonnets as second in importance to the nomenclature of a vegetable i in my turn was delighted with his ayacot how right i was to suspect the outlandish word of american indian origin how right the insect was in testifying in its own fashion that the precious bean came to us from the new world while still retaining its original nameor something sufficiently like itthe bean of montezuma the aztec ayacot has migrated from mexico to the kitchengardens of europe but it has reached us without the company of its licensed consumer for there must assuredly be a weevil in its native country which levies tribute on its nourishing tissues our native beaneaters have mistaken the stranger they have not had time as yet to grow familiar with it or to appreciate its merits they have prudently abstained from touching the ayacot whose novelty awoke suspicion until our own days the mexican bean remained untouched unlike our other leguminous seeds which are all eagerly exploited by the weevil this state of affairs could not last if our own fields do not contain the insect amateur of the haricot the new world knows it well enough by the road of commercial exchange sooner or later some wormeaten sack of haricots must bring it to europe the invasion is inevitable according to documents now before me indeed it has already taken place three or four years ago i received from maillane in the bouchesdurhne what i sought in vain in my own neighbourhood although i questioned many a farmer and housewife and astonished them by my questions no one had ever seen the pest of the haricot no one had ever heard of it friends who knew of my inquiries sent me from maillane as i have said information that gave great satisfaction to my naturalists curiosity it was accompanied by a measure of haricots which were utterly and outrageously spoiled every bean was riddled with holes changed into a kind of sponge within them swarmed innumerable weevils which recalled by their diminutive size the lentilweevil bruchus lenti the senders told me of the loss experienced at maillane the odious little creature they said had destroyed the greater portion of the harvest a veritable plague such as had never before been known had fallen upon the haricots leaving the housewife barely a handful to put in the saucepan of the habits of the creature and its way of going to work nothing was known it was for me to discover them by means of experiment quick then let us experiment the circumstances favour me we are in the middle of june and in my garden there is a bed of early haricots the black belgian haricots sown for use in the kitchen since i must sacrifice the toothsome vegetable let us loose the terrible destroyer on the mass of verdure the development of the plant is at the requisite stage if i may go by what the bruchus pisi has already taught me the flowers are abundant and the pods are equally so still green and of all sizes i place on a plate two or three handfuls of the infested haricots and set the populous heap in the full sunlight by the edge of my bed of beans i can imagine what will happen those insects which are already free and those which the stimulus of the sunshine will presently liberate will emerge and take to their wings finding the maternal haricot close at hand they will take possession of the vines i shall see them exploring pods and flowers and before very long they will lay their eggs that is how the peaweevil would behave under similar conditions but no to my surprise and confusion matters do not fall out as i foresaw for a few minutes the insects bustle about in the sunlight opening and closing their wingcovers to ease the mechanism of flight then one by one they fly away mounting in the luminous air they grow smaller and smaller to the sight and are quickly lost to view my persevering attentions have not met with the slightest success not one of the weevils has settled on my haricots when the joys of liberty have been tasted will they returntonight tomorrow or later no they do not return all that week at favourable hours i inspect the rows of beans pod by pod flower by flower but never a bruchus do i see nor even an egg yet the season is propitious for at this very moment the mothers imprisoned in my jars lay a profusion of eggs upon the dry haricots next season i try again i have at my disposal two other beds which i have sown with the late haricot the red haricot partly for the use of the household but principally for the benefit of the weevil arranged in convenient rows the two crops will be ready one in august and one in september or later with the red haricot i repeat the experiment already essayed with the black haricot on several occasions in suitable weather i release large numbers of weevils from my glass jars the general headquarters of the tribe on each occasion the result is plainly negative all through the season until both crops are exhausted i repeat my search almost daily but i can never discover a single pod infested nor even a single weevil perching on leaf or flower certainly the inspection has not been at fault the household is warned to respect certain rows of beans which i have reserved for myself it is also requested to keep a lookout for eggs on all the pods gathered i myself examine with a magnifyingglass all the haricots coming from my own or from neighbouring gardens before handing them over to the housewife to be shelled all my trouble is wasted there is not an egg to be seen to these experiments in the open air i add others performed under glass i place in some tall narrow bottles fresh haricot pods hanging from their stems some green others mottled with crimson and containing seeds not far from mature each bottle is finally given a population of weevils this time i obtain some eggs but i am no further advanced they are laid on the sides of the bottles but not on the pods nevertheless they hatch for a few days i see the grubs wandering about exploring the pods and the glass with equal zeal finally one and all perish without touching the food provided the conclusion to be drawn from these facts is obvious the young and tender haricot is not the proper diet unlike the bruchus pisi the female of the haricotweevil refuses to trust her family to beans that are not hardened by age and desiccation she refused to settle on my beanpatch because the food she required was not to be found there what does she require evidently the mature dry hard haricot which falls to earth with the sound of a small pebble i hasten to satisfy her i place in the bottles some very mature horny pods thoroughly desiccated by exposure to the sun this time the family prospers the grubs perforate the dry shell reach the beans penetrate them and henceforth all goes well to judge by appearances then the weevil invades the granary the beans are left standing in the fields until both plants and pods shrivelled by the sun are completely desiccated the process of beating the pods to loosen and separate the beans is thus greatly facilitated it is then that the weevil finding matters to suit her commences to lay her eggs by storing his crop a little late the peasant stores the pest as well but the weevil more especially attacks the haricot when warehoused like the calanderbeetle which nibbles the wheat in our granaries but despises the cereal while still on the stalk it abhors the bean while tender and prefers to establish itself in the peace and darkness of the storehouse it is a formidable enemy to the merchant rather than to the peasant what a fury of destruction once the ravager is installed in the vegetable treasurehouse my bottles give abundant evidence of this one single haricot bean shelters a numerous family often as many as twenty members and not one generation only exploits the bean but three or four in the year so long as the skin of the bean contains any edible matter so long do new consumers establish themselves within it so that the haricot finally becomes a mere shell stuffed with excreta the skin despised by the grubs is a mere sac pierced with holes as many as the inhabitants that have deserted it the ruin is complete the bruchus pisi a solitary hermit consumes only so much of the pea as will leave a cell for the nymph the rest remains intact so that the pea may be sown or it will even serve as food if we can overcome our repugnance the american insect knows nothing of these limitations it empties the haricot completely and leaves a skinful of filth that i have seen the pigs refuse america is anything but considerate when she sends us her entomological pests we owe the phylloxera to america the phylloxera that calamitous insect against which our vinegrowers wage incessant war and today she is sending us the haricotweevil which threatens to be a plague of the future a few experiments gave me some idea of the peril of such an invasion for nearly three years there have stood on my laboratory table some dozens of jars and bottles covered with pieces of gauze which prevent escape while permitting of a constant ventilation these are the cages of my menagerie in them i rear the haricotweevil varying the system of education at will amongst other things i have learned that this insect far from being exclusive in its choice will accommodate itself to most of our leguminous foods all the haricots suit it black and white red and variegated large and small those of the latest crop and those which have been many years in stock and are almost completely refractory to boiling water the loose beans are attacked by preference as being easier to invade but when the loose beans are not available those in the natural shelter of their pods are attacked with equal zest however dry and parchmentlike the pods the grubs have no difficulty in attaining the seeds when attacked in the field or garden the bean is attacked in this way through the pod the bean known in provence as the blind haricotlou faio borgna bean with a long pod which is marked with a black spot at the navel which has the look of a closed and blackened eye is also greatly appreciated indeed i fancy my little guests show an obvious preference for this particular bean so far nothing abnormal the bruchus does not wander beyond the limits of the botanical family phaseolus but here is a characteristic that increases the peril and shows us this lover of beans in an unexpected light without the slightest hesitation it accepts the dry pea the bean the vetch the tare and the chickpea it goes from one to the other always satisfied its offspring live and prosper in all these seeds as well as in the haricot only the lentil is refused perhaps on account of its insufficient volume the american weevil is a formidable experimentalist the peril would be much greater did the insect pass from leguminous seeds to cereals as at first i feared it might but it does not do so imprisoned in my bottles together with a handful of wheat barley rice or maize the bruchus invariably perished and left no offspring the result was the same with oleaginous seeds such as castoroil and sunflower nothing outside the bean family is of any use to the bruchus thus limited its portion is none the less considerable and it uses and abuses it with the utmost energy the eggs are white slender and cylindrical there is no method in their distribution no choice in their deposition the mother lays them singly or in little groups on the walls of the jar as well as on the haricots in her negligence she will even lay them on maize coffee castoroil seeds and other seeds on which the newly born grubs will promptly perish not finding them to their taste what place has maternal foresight here abandoned no matter where in the heap of seeds the eggs are always in place as it is left to the grub to search and to find the points of invasion in five days at most the egg is hatched a little white creature with a redbrown head emerges it is a mere speck of a creature just visible to the naked eye its body is thickened forward to give more strength to its implementsits mandibleswhich have to perforate the hard substance of the dry bean which is as tough as wood the larv of the buprestis and the capricornis which burrow in the trunks of trees are similarly shaped directly it issues from the egg the wriggling creature makes off at random with an activity we should hardly expect in one so young it wanders hither and thither eager to find food and shelter as soon as possible within twentyfour hours it has usually attained both i see the tiny grub perforate the horny skin that covers the cotyledons i watch its efforts i surprise it sunk halfway in the commencement of a burrow at the mouth of which is a white floury powder the waste from the mandibles it works its way inward and buries itself in the heart of the seed it will emerge in the adult form in the course of about five weeks so rapid is its evolution this hasty development allows of several generations in the year i have recorded four on the other hand one isolated couple has furnished me with a family of eighty consider only the half of this numbersupposing the sexes to be equal in numberand at the end of a year the couples issued from this original pair would be represented by the fortieth power of forty in larv they would represent the frightful total of more than five millions what a mountain of haricots would be ravaged by such a legion the industry of the larv reminds us at every point what we have learned from the bruchus pisi each grub excavates a lodging in the mass of the bean respecting the epidermis and preparing a circular trapdoor which the adult can easily open with a push at the moment of emergence at the termination of the larval phase the lodgements are betrayed on the surface of the bean by so many shadowy circles finally the lid falls the insect leaves its cell and the haricot remains pierced by as many holes as it has nourished grubs extremely frugal satisfied with a little farinaceous powder the adults seem by no means anxious to abandon the native heap or bin so long as there are beans untouched they mate in the interstices of the heap the mothers sow their eggs at random the young larv establish themselves some in beans that are so far intact some in beans which are perforated but not yet exhausted and all through the summer the operations of breeding are repeated once in every five weeks the last generation of the yearthat of september or octobersleeps in its cells until the warm weather returns if the haricot pest were ever to threaten us seriously it would not be very difficult to wage a war of extermination against it its habits teach us what tactics we ought to follow it exploits the dried and gathered crop in the granary or the storehouse if it is difficult to attack it in the open it would also be useless the greater part of its affairs are managed elsewhere in our storehouses the enemy establishes itself under our roof and is ready to our hand by means of insecticides defence should be relatively easy chapter xx the grey locust i have just witnessed a moving spectacle the last moult of a locust the emergence of the adult from its larval envelope it was magnificent i am speaking of the grey locust the colossus among our acridians10 which is often seen among the vines in september when the grapes are gathered by its sizeand it grows as long as a mans fingerit lends itself to observation better than any other of its tribe the larva disgustingly fat like a rude sketch of the perfect insect is commonly of a tender green but it is sometimes of a bluish green a dirty yellow or a ruddy brown or even an ashen grey like the grey of the adult cricket the corselet is strongly keeled and indented and is sprinkled with fine white spots as powerful as in the adult insect the hindleg has a corpulent haunch streaked with red and a long shin like a twoedged saw the elytra which in a few days will extend far beyond the tip of the abdomen are at present too small triangular winglike appendages touching along their upper edges and continuing and emphasising the keel or ridge of the corselet their free ends stick up like the gable of a house they remind one of the skirts of a coat the maker of which has been ludicrously stingy with the cloth as they merely cover the creatures nakedness at the small of the back underneath there are two narrow appendages the germs of the wings which are even smaller than the elytra the sumptuous elegant sails of tomorrow are now mere rags so miserly in their dimensions as to be absolutely grotesque what will emerge from these miserable coverings a miracle of grace and amplitude let us observe the whole process in detail feeling itself ripe for transformation the insect climbs up the wiregauze cover by means of its hinder and intermediate limbs the forelimbs are folded and crossed on the breast and are not employed in supporting the insect which hangs in a reversed position the back downwards the triangular winglets the sheaths of the elytra open along their line of juncture and separate laterally the two narrow blades which contain the wings rise in the centre of the interval and slightly diverge the proper position for the process of moulting has now been assumed and the proper stability assured the first thing to do is to burst the old skin behind the corselet under the pointed roof of the prothorax a series of pulsations is produced by alternate inflation and deflation a similar state of affairs is visible in front of the neck and probably under the entire surface of the yielding carapace the fineness of the membrane at the articulations enables us to perceive it at these unarmoured points but the cuirass of the corselet conceals it in the central portion at these points the circulatory reserves of the insect are pulsing in tidal onsets their gradual increase is betrayed by pulsations like those of a hydraulic ram distended by this rush of humours by this injection in which the organism concentrates all its forces the outer skin finally splits along the line of least resistance which the subtle previsions of life have prepared the fissure extends the whole length of the corselet opening precisely along the ridge of the keel as though the two symmetrical halves had been soldered together unbreakable elsewhere the envelope has yielded at this median point which had remained weaker than the rest of the sheath the fissure runs back a little way until it reaches a point between the attachments of the wings on the head it runs forward as far as the base of the antenn when it sends a short ramification right and left through this breach the back is seen quite soft and very pale with scarcely a tinge of grey slowly it curves upwards and becomes more and more strongly hunched at last it is free the head follows withdrawing itself from its mask which remains in place intact in the smallest detail but looking very strange with its great unseeing glassy eyes the sheaths of the antenn without a wrinkle without the least derangement and in their natural place hang over this dead translucid face in emerging from their narrow sheaths which clasped them so tightly and precisely the threadlike antenn have evidently met with no resistance or the sheaths would have been turned inside out or crumpled out of shape or wrinkled at least without harming the jointed or knotted covers the contents of equal volume and equally knotty have slipped out as easily as though they were smooth slippery objects sliding out of a loose sheath the method of extraction is still more astonishing in the case of the hindlegs it is now however the turn of the front and intermediate pairs of legs they pull out of their gauntlets and leggings without the least hitch nothing is torn nothing buckled the outer skin is not even crumpled and all the tissues remain in their natural position the insect is now hanging from the dome of the cover solely by the claws of the long hindlegs it hangs in an almost vertical position the head downwards swinging like a pendulum if i touch the cover four tiny steely claws are its only support if they gave or unclasped themselves the insect would be lost as it is as yet unable to unfurl its enormous wings but even had the wings emerged they could not grip the air in time to save the creature from the consequences of a fall but the four claws hold fast life before withdrawing from them left them rigidly contracted so that they should support without yielding the struggles and withdrawals to follow now the wingcovers and wings emerge these are four narrow strips vaguely seamed and furrowed like strings of rolled tissuepaper they are barely a quarter of their final length they are so soft that they bend under their own weight and hang down the creatures sides in the reverse of their normal position the free extremities which normally point backwards are now pointing towards the crickets head as it hangs reversed the organs of future flight are like four leaves of withered foliage shattered by a terrific rainstorm a profound transformation is necessary to bring the wings to their final perfection the inner changes are already at work liquids are solidifying albuminous secretions are bringing order out of chaos but so far no outward sign betrays what is happening in the mysterious laboratory of the organism all seems inert and lifeless in the meantime the posterior limbs disengage themselves the great haunches become visible streaked on the inner faces with a pale rose which rapidly turns to a vivid crimson emergence is easy the thick and muscular upper portion of the haunch preparing the way for the narrower part of the limb it is otherwise with the shank this in the adult insect is armed along its whole length by a double series of stiff steely spines moreover the lower extremity is terminated by four strong spurs the shank forms a veritable saw but with two parallel sets of teeth and it is so strongly made that it may well be compared the question of size apart to the great saw of a quarryman the shank of the larva has the same structure so that the object to be extracted is enclosed in a scabbard as awkwardly shaped as itself each spur is enclosed in a similar spur each tooth engages in the hollow of a similar tooth and the sheath is so closely moulded upon the shank that a no more intimate contact could be obtained by replacing the envelope by a layer of varnish applied with a brush nevertheless the tibia long and narrow as it is issues from its sheath without catching or sticking anywhere if i had not repeatedly seen the operation i could not believe it possible for the discarded sheath is absolutely intact from end to end neither the terminal spurs nor the double rows of spines do the slightest damage to the delicate mould the longtoothed saw leaves the delicate sheath unbroken although a puff of the breath is enough to tear it the ferocious spurs slip out of it without leaving so much as a scratch i was far from expecting such a result having the spiny weapons of the legs in mind i imagined that those limbs would moult in scales and patches or that the sheathing would rub off like a dead scarfskin how completely the reality surpassed my anticipations from the spurs and spines of the sheath which is as thin as the finest goldbeaters skin the spurs and spines of the leg which make it a most formidable weapon capable of cutting a piece of soft wood emerge without the slightest display of violence without a hitch of any kind and the empty skin remains in place still clinging by its claws to the top of the wire cover it is untorn unwrinkled uncreased even the magnifyingglass fails to show a trace of rough usage such as the skin was before the cricket left it so it is now the legging of dead skin remains in its smallest details the exact replica of the living limb if any one asked you to extract a saw from a scabbard exactly moulded upon the steel and to conduct the operation without the slightest degree of tearing or scratching you would laugh at the flagrant impossibility of the task but life makes light of such absurdities it has its methods of performing the impossible when such methods are required the leg of the locust affords us such an instance hard as it is when once free of its sheath the serrated tibia would absolutely refuse to leave the latter so closely does it fit unless it were torn to pieces yet the difficulty must be evaded for it is indispensable that the sheaths of the legs should remain intact in order to afford a firm support until the insect is completely extricated the leg in process of liberation is not the leg with which the locust makes its leaps it has not as yet the rigidity which it will soon acquire it is soft and eminently flexible in those portions which the progress of the moult exposes to view i see the legs bend under the mere weight of the suspended insect when i tilt the supporting cover they are as flexible as two strips of elastic indiarubber yet even now consolidation is progressing for in a few minutes the proper rigidity will be acquired further along the limbs in the portions which the sheathing still conceals the legs are certainly softer still and in the state of exquisite plasticityi had almost said fluiditywhich allows them to pass through narrow passages almost as a liquid flows the teeth of the saws are already there but have nothing of their imminent rigidity with the point of a penknife i can partially uncover a leg and extract the spines from their serrated mould they are germs of spines flexible buds which bend under the slightest pressure and resume their position the moment the pressure is removed these needles point backwards as the leg is drawn out of the sheath but they reerect themselves and solidify as they emerge i am witnessing not the mere removal of leggings from limbs already clad in finished armour but a kind of creation which amazes one by its promptitude very much in the same way but with far less delicate precision the claws of the crayfish at the period of the moult withdraw the soft flesh of their double fingers from their stony sheath finally the long stiltlike legs are free they are folded gently against the furrowed thighs thus to mature undisturbed the abdomen begins to emerge its fine tuniclike covering splits and wrinkles but still encloses the extremity of the abdomen which adheres to the moulted skin for some little time longer with the exception of this one point the entire insect is now uncovered it hangs head downwards like a pendulum supported by the talons of the now empty legcases during the whole of the lengthy and meticulous process the four talons have never yielded the whole operation has been conducted with the utmost delicacy and prudence the insect hangs motionless held by the tip of the abdomen the abdomen is disproportionately distended swollen apparently by the reserve of organisable humours which the expansion of the wings and wingcovers will presently employ meanwhile the creature rests and recovers from its exertions twenty minutes of waiting elapse then exerting the muscles of the back the suspended insect raises itself and fixes the talons of the anterior limbs in the empty skin above it never did acrobat hanging by the toes to the bar of a trapeze raise himself with so stupendous a display of strength in the loins this gymnastic feat accomplished the rest is easy with the purchase thus obtained the insect rises a little and reaches the wire gauze the equivalent of the twig which would be chosen for the site of the transformation in the open fields it holds to this with the four anterior limbs then the tip of the abdomen is finally liberated and suddenly shaken by the final struggle the empty skin falls to the ground this fall is interesting and reminds me of the persistence with which the empty husk of the cigale braves the winds of winter without falling from its supporting twig the transfiguration of the locust takes place very much as does that of the cigale how is it then that the acridian trusts to a hold so easily broken the talons of the skin hold firmly so long as the labour of escape continues although one would expect it to shake the firmest grip yet they yield at the slightest shock when the labour is terminated there is evidently a condition of highly unstable equilibrium showing once more with what delicate precision the insect escapes from its sheath for want of a better term i said escape but the word is ill chosen for it implies a certain amount of violence and no violence must be employed on account of the instability of equilibrium already mentioned if the insect shaken by a sudden effort were to lose its hold it would be all up with it it would slowly shrivel on the spot or at best its wings unable to expand would remain as miserable scraps of tissue the locust does not tear itself away from its sheath it delicately insinuates itself out of iti had almost said flows it is as though it were expelled by a gentle pressure let us return to the wings and elytra which have made no apparent progress since their emergence from their sheaths they are still mere stumps with fine longitudinal seams almost like little ropesends their expansion which will occupy more than three hours is reserved for the end when the insect is completely moulted and in its normal position we have just seen the insect turn head uppermost this reversal causes the wings and elytra to fall into their natural position extremely flexible and yielding to their own weight they had previously drooped backwards with their free extremities pointing towards the head of the insect as it hung reversed now still by reason of their own weight their position is rectified and they point in the normal direction they are no longer curved like the petals of a flower they no longer point the wrong way but they retain the same miserable aspect in its perfect state the wing is like a fan a radiating bundle of strong nervures runs through it in the direction of its length and forms the framework of the fan which is readily furled and unfurled the intervals are crossed by innumerable crossnervures of slighter substance which make of the whole a network of rectangular meshes the elytrum which is heavier and much less extensive repeats this structure at present nothing of this meshwork is visible nothing can be seen but a few wrinkles a few flexuous furrows which announce that the stumps are bundles of tissue cunningly folded and reduced to the smallest possible volume the expansion of the wing begins near the shoulder where nothing precise could be distinguished at the outset we soon perceive a diaphanous surface subdivided into meshes of beautiful precision little by little with a deliberation that escapes the magnifier this area increases its bounds at the expense of the shapeless bundle at the end of the wing in vain i let my eyes rest on the spot where the expanding network meets the still shapeless bundle i can distinguish nothing but wait a little and the finemeshed tissues will appear with perfect distinctness to judge from this first examination one would guess that an organisable fluid is rapidly congealing into a network of nervures one seems to be watching a process of crystallisation comparable in its rapidity to that of a saturated saline solution as seen through a microscope but no this is not what is actually happening life does not do its work so abruptly i detach a halfdeveloped wing and bring it under the powerful eye of the microscope this time i am satisfied on the confines of the transparent network where an extension of that network seems to be gradually weaving itself out of nothing i can see that the meshes are really already in existence i can plainly recognise the longitudinal nervures which are already stiff and i can also seepale and without reliefthe transverse nervures i find them all in the terminal stump and am able to spread out a few of its folds under the microscope it is obvious that the wing is not a tissue in the process of making through which the procreative energy of the vital juices is shooting its shuttle it is a tissue already complete to be perfect it lacks only expansion and rigidity just as a piece of lace or linen needs only to be ironed in three hours or more the explanation is complete the wings and elytra stand erect over the locusts back like an immense set of sails at first colourless then of a tender green like the freshly expanded wings of the cigale i am amazed at their expanse when i think of the miserable stumps from which they have expanded how did so much material contrive to occupy so little space there is a story of a grain of hempseed that contained all the bodylinen of a princess here we have something even more astonishing the hempseed of the story needed long years to germinate to multiply and at last to give the quantity of hemp required for the trousseau of a princess but the germ of the locusts wing has expanded to a magnificent sail in a few short hours slowly the superb erection composed of the four flat fanlike pinions assumes rigidity and colour by tomorrow the colour will have attained the requisite shade for the first time the wings close fanwise and lie down in their places the elytra bend over at their outer edges forming a flange which lies snugly over the flanks the transformation is complete now the great locust has only to harden its tissues a little longer and to tan the grey of its costume in the ecstasy of the sunshine let us leave it to its happiness and return to an earlier moment the four stumps which emerge from their coverings shortly after the rupture of the corselet along its median line contain as we have seen the wings and elytra with their innumerable nervures if not perfect at least the general plan is complete with all its innumerable details to expand these miserable bundles and convert them into an ample set of sails it is enough that the organism acting like a forcepump should force into the channels already prepared a stream of humours kept in reserve for this moment and this purpose the most laborious of the whole process as the capillary channels are prepared in advance a slight injection of fluid is sufficient to cause expansion but what were these four bundles of tissue while still enclosed in their sheaths are the wingsheaths and the triangular winglets of the larva the moulds whose folds wrinkles and sinuosities form their contents in their own image and so weave the network of the future wings and wingcovers were they really moulds we might for a moment be satisfied we might tell ourselves it is quite a simple matter that the thing moulded should conform to the cavity of the mould but the simplicity is only apparent for the mould in its turn must somewhere derive the requisite and inextricable complexity we need not go so far back we should only be in darkness let us keep to the observable facts i examine with a magnifyingglass one of the triangular coattails of a larva on the point of transformation i see a bundle of moderately strong nervures radiating fanwise i see other nervures in the intervals pale and very fine finally still more delicate and running transversely a number of very short nervures complete the pattern certainly this resembles a rough sketch of the future wingcase but how different from the mature structure the disposition of the radiating nervures the skeleton of the structure is not at all the same the network formed by the crossnervures gives no idea whatever of the complex final arrangement the rudimentary is succeeded by the infinitely complex the clumsy by the infinitely perfect and the same is true of the sheath of the wing and the final condition of its contents the perfect wing it is perfectly evident when we have the preparatory as well as the final condition of the wing before our eyes that the wingsheath of the larva is not a simple mould which elaborates the tissue enclosed in its own image and fashions the wing after the complexities of its own cavity the future wing is not contained in the sheath as a bundle which will astonish us when expanded by the extent and extreme complication of its surface or to speak more exactly it is there but in a potential state before becoming an actual thing it is a virtual thing which is not yet but is capable of becoming it is there as the oak is inside the acorn a fine transparent cushion limits the free edge of the embryo wing and the embryo wingcase under a powerful microscope we can perceive therein a few doubtful lineaments of the future lacework this might well be the factory in which life will shortly set its materials in movement nothing more is visible nothing that will make us foresee the prodigious network in which each mesh must have its form and place predetermined with geometrical exactitude in order that the organisable material can shape itself as a sheet of gauze and describe the inextricable labyrinth of the nervuration there must be something better and more wonderful than a mould there is a prototypical plan an ideal pattern which imposes a precise position upon each atom of the tissue before the material commences to circulate the configuration is already virtually traced the courses of the plastic currents are already mapped out the stones of our buildings coordinate according to the considered plan of the architect they form an ideal assemblage before they exist as a concrete assemblage similarly the wing of a cricket that wonderful piece of lacework emerging from a tiny sheath speaks to us of another architect the author of the plans according to which life labours the genesis of living creatures offers to our contemplation an infinity of wonders far greater than this matter of a locusts wing but in general they pass unperceived obscured as they are by the veil of time time in the deliberation of mysteries deprives us of the most astonishing of spectacles except our spirits be endowed with a tenacious patience here by exception the fact is accomplished with a swiftness that forces the attention whosoever would gain without wearisome delays a glimpse of the inconceivable dexterity with which the forces of life can labour has only to consider the great locust of the vineyard the insect will show him that which is hidden from our curiosity by extreme deliberation in the germinating seed the opening leaf and the budding flower we cannot see the grass grow but we can watch the growth of the locusts wings amazement seizes upon us before this sublime phantasmagoria of the grain of hemp which in a few hours has been transmuted into the finest cloth what a mighty artist is life shooting her shuttle to weave the wings of the locustone of those insignificant insects of whom long ago pliny said in his tam parcis fer nullis quae vis quae sapientia quam inextricabilis perfectio how truly was the old naturalist inspired let us repeat with him what power what wisdom what inconceivable perfection in this least of secrets that the vineyard locust has shown us i have heard that a learned inquirer for whom life is only a conflict of physical and chemical forces does not despair of one day obtaining artificially organisable matterprotoplasm as the official jargon has it if it were in my power i should hasten to satisfy this ambitious gentleman but so be it you have really prepared protoplasm by force of meditation profound study minute care impregnable patience your desire is realised you have extracted from your apparatus an albuminous slime easily corruptible and stinking like the devil at the end of a few days in short a nastiness what are you going to do with it organise something will you give it the structure of a living edifice will you inject it with a hypodermic syringe between two impalpable plates to obtain were it only the wing of a fly that is very much what the locust does it injects its protoplasm between the two surfaces of an embryo organ and the material forms a wingcover because it finds as guide the ideal archetype of which i spoke but now it is controlled in the labyrinth of its course by a device anterior to the injection anterior to the material itself this archetype the coordinator of forms this primordial regulator have you got it on the end of your syringe no then throw away your product life will never spring from that chemical filth chapter xxi the pinechafer the orthodox denomination of this insect is melolontha fullo lin it does not answer i am very well aware to be difficult in matters of nomenclature make a noise of some sort affix a latin termination and you will have as far as euphony goes the equivalent of many of the tickets pasted in the entomologists specimen boxes the cacophony would be excusable if the barbarous term signified nothing but the creature signified but as a rule this name possesses hidden in its greek or other roots a certain meaning in which the novice hopes to find instruction the hope is a delusion the learned term refers to subtleties difficult to comprehend and of very indifferent importance too often it leads the student astray giving him glimpses that have nothing whatever in common with the truth as we know it from observation very often the errors implied by such names are flagrant sometimes the allusions are ridiculous grotesque or merely imbecile so long as they have a decent sound how infinitely preferable are locutions in which etymology finds nothing to dissect of such would be the word fullo were it not that it already has a meaning which immediately occurs to the mind this latin expression means a fuller a person who kneads and presses cloth under a stream of water making it flexible and ridding it of the asperities of weaving what connection has the subject of this chapter with the fuller of cloth i may puzzle my head in vain no acceptable reply will occur to me the term fullo as applied to an insect is found in pliny in one chapter the great naturalist treats of remedies against jaundice fevers and dropsy a little of everything enters into this antique pharmacy the longest tooth of a black dog the nose of a mouse wrapped in a pink cloth the right eye of a green lizard torn from the living animal and placed in a bag of kidskin the heart of a serpent cut out with the left hand the four articulations of the tail of a scorpion including the dart wrapped tightly in a black cloth so that for three days the sick man can see neither the remedy nor him that applies it and a number of other extravagances we may well close the book alarmed at the slough of the imbecility whence the art of healing has come down to us in the midst of these imbecilities the preludes of medicine we find a mention of the fuller tertium qui vocatur fullo albis guttis dissectum utrique lacerto adalligant says the text to treat fevers divide the fuller beetle in two parts and apply half under the right arm and half under the left illustration the pinechafer melolontha fullo now what did the ancient naturalist mean by the term fuller beetle we do not precisely know the qualification albis guttis white spots would fit the pinechafer well enough but it is not sufficient to make us certain pliny himself does not seem to have been very certain of the identity of the remedy in his time mens eyes had not yet learned to see the insect world insects were too small they were well enough for amusing children who would tie them to the end of a long thread and make them walk in circles but they were not worthy of occupying the attention of a selfrespecting man pliny apparently derived the word from the countryfolk always poor observers and inclined to extravagant denominations the scholar accepted the rural locution the work perhaps of the imagination of childhood and applied it at hazard without informing himself more particularly the word came down to us embalmed with age our modern naturalists have accepted it and thus one of our handsomest insects has become the fuller the majesty of antiquity has consecrated the strange appellation in spite of all my respect for the antique i cannot myself accept the term fuller because under the circumstances it is absurd common sense should be considered before the aberrations of nomenclature why not call our subject the pinechafer in reference to the beloved tree the paradise of the insect during the two or three weeks of its aerial life nothing could be simpler or more appropriate to give the better reason last we have to wander for ages in the night of absurdity before we reach the radiant light of the truth all our sciences witness to this fact even the science of numbers try to add a column of roman figures you will abandon the task stupefied by the confusion of symbols and will recognise what a revolution was made in arithmetic by the discovery of the zero like the egg of columbus it was a very little thing but it had to be thought of while hoping that the future will sink the unfortunate fuller in oblivion we will use the term pine chafer between ourselves under that name no one can possibly mistake the insect in question which frequents the pinetree only it has a handsome and dignified appearance rivalling that of oryctes nasicornis its costume if it has not the metallic splendour dear to the scarabi the buprestes and the rosebeetles is at least unusually elegant a black or chestnut background is thickly sown with capriciously shaped spots of white velvet a fashion both modest and handsome the male bears at the end of his short antenn a kind of plume consisting of seven large superimposed plates or leaves which opening and closing like the sticks of a fan betray the emotions that possess him at first sight it seems that this magnificent foliage must form a senseorgan of great perfection capable of perceiving subtle odours or almost inaudible vibrations of the air or other phenomena to which our senses fail to respond but the female warns us that we must not place too much reliance on such ideas for although her maternal duties demand a degree of impressionability at least as great as that of the male yet the plumes of her antenn are extremely meagre containing only six narrow leaves what then is the use of the enormous fanlike structure of the male antenn the sevenleaved apparatus is for the pinechafer what his long vibrating horns are to the cerambyx and the panoply of the head to the onthophagus and the forked antlers of the mandibles to the stagbeetle each decks himself after his manner in these nuptial extravagances this handsome chafer appears towards the summer solstice almost simultaneously with the first cigales the punctuality of its appearance gives it a place in the entomological calendar which is no less punctual than that of the seasons when the longest days come those days which seem endless and gild the harvests it never fails to hasten to its tree the fires of st john reminiscences of the festivals of the sun which the children light in the village streets are not more punctual in their date at this season in the hours of twilight the pinechafer comes every evening if the weather is fine to visit the pinetrees in the garden i follow its evolutions with my eyes with a silent flight not without spirit the males especially wheel and wheel about extending their great antennary plumes they go to and fro to and fro a procession of flying shadows upon the pale blue of the sky in which the last light of day is dying they settle take flight again and once more resume their busy rounds what are they doing up there during the fortnight of their festival the answer is evident they are courting their mates and they continue to render their homage until the fall of night in the morning both males and females commonly occupy the lower branches they lie there isolated motionless indifferent to passing events they do not avoid the hand about to seize them most of them are hanging by their hind legs and nibbling the pineneedles they seem to be gently drowsing with the needles at their mouths when twilight returns they resume their frolics to watch these frolics in the tops of the trees is hardly possible let us try to observe them in captivity four pairs are collected in the morning and placed with some twigs off the pinetree in a spacious cage the sight is hardly worth my attention deprived of the possibility of flight the insects cannot behave as in the open at most i see a male from time to time approaching his beloved he spreads out the leaves of his antenn and agitates them so that they shiver slightly he is perhaps informing himself if he is welcome thereupon he puts on his finest airs and exhibits his attainments it is a useless display the female is motionless as though insensible to these demonstrations captivity has sorrows that are hard to overcome this was all that i was able to see mating it appears must take place during the later hours of the night so that i missed the propitious moment one detail in particular interested me the pinechafer emits a musical note the female is as gifted as the male does the lover make use of his faculty as a means of seduction and appeal does the female answer the chirp of her innamorata by a similar chirp that this may be so under normal conditions amidst the foliage of the pines is extremely probable but i can make no assertion as i have never heard anything of the kind either among the pines or in my laboratory the sound is produced by the extremity of the abdomen which gently rises and falls rubbing as it does so with its last few segments the hinder edge of the wingcovers which are held firm and motionless there is no special equipment on the rubbing surface nor on the surface rubbed the magnifyingglass looks in vain for the fine striations usually found in the musical instruments of the insect world all is smooth on either hand how then is the sound engendered rub the end of the moistened finger on a strip of glass or a windowpane and you will obtain a very audible sound somewhat analogous to that emitted by the chafer better still use a scrap of indiarubber to rub the glass with and you will reproduce with some fidelity the sound in question if the proper rhythm is observed the imitation is so successful that one might well be deceived by it in the musical apparatus of the pinechafer the pad of the fingertip and the scrap of indiarubber are represented by the soft abdomen of the insect and the glass is represented by the blade of the wingcover which forms a thin rigid plate easily set in vibration the soundmechanism of

male cigales cry would cause a resonance a vibration in the body cavities of other male cigales and to a lesser extent in the smaller cavities in the bodies of the females other sounds would cause a slight shock if loud enough but not a perceptible vibration may not this vibrationfelt as in a cathedral we feel the vibrations of the organpipes in the bones of the chest and head or on the covers of the hymnbook in our handsserve to keep the insects together and enable the females to keep within sight of the males the sight of an insect is in one sense poorit consists of a kind of mosaic picture and for one insect to distinguish another clearly the distance between them must not be very great certain gregarious birds and fish whose colouring is protective have a habit of showing their white bellies as they swerve on changing their direction these signals help to keep the flock together the white scut of the rabbit and of certain deer is a signal for other deer or rabbits to follow a frightened flock it is obviously to the advantage of the cigale to follow a gregarious habit if only for purposes of propagation for this would be facilitated by the sexes keeping together and deaf or otherwise the vibrations of its cry would enable it to do so it would be easy to show a priori that the perception of such vibrations must cause the insect pleasure as they stimulate a nervous structure attuned to the perception or capable of the production of certain complex vibrations the discord of the cry is caused by the fact that it consists of a number of vibrations of different pitch some would set the contents of the male resonating cavities in vibration others would affect the less regular cavities in the thorax of the female we might compare the cigales cry to a sheepbell that it is felt and not heard explains its loudness and its grating quality a cigale with the resonating cavities destroyed would possibly be lost the experiment is worth tryingtrans footnote 2 it is not easy to understand why the mantis should paralyse the cricket with terror while the latter will immediately escape when threatened by other enemies as many species of mantis exactly mimic sticks and leaves when motionless for purposes of defence is it not possible that they mimic their surroundings for purposes of offence as well it is easy and natural to say that the mantis presents a terrifying aspect it does to us by association but how can we say that it represents anything of the sort to the probably hypnotic or automatic consciousness of the cricket what does it really represent as seen from below a twig terminating in a bud with two branching twigs growing from it and a harmless nondescript fly or butterfly perched on the back of it the combination of a familiar sight and a threatening sound would very plausibly result in cautious immobility as for its instantaneous assumption of the pose to move instantaneously is the next best thing to not moving at all it is less likely to startle than a slow movement twigs which have been bent get suddenly released in the natural course of events they do not move slowly the instantaneous appearance of a twig where no twig was before may possibly give the victim pause it may halt out of caution not out of terrortrans footnote 3 the word butterfly is here used as is the french papillon as a general term for all lepidoptera the insect in question is of course a moth footnote 4 now classified as lasiocampa quercustrans footnote 5 rabasso is the provenal name for the truffle hence a trufflehunter is known as a rabassier footnote 6 since these lines were written i have found it consuming one of the true tuberace the tuber requienii tul of the size of a cherry footnote 7 the difficulty in conceiving this theory lies in the fact that the waves travel in straight lines on the other hand matter in a state of degradation may expel particles highly energised and of enormous velocity most antenn are covered with hairs of inconceivable fineness others may contain cavities of almost infinite minuteness is it not thinkable that they are able to detect in the gaseous atmosphere floating particles that are not gaseous this would not prevent the specialisation of antenn as mere feelers in some insects and crustaceans the difficulty of such a supposition lies in the fact of discrimination but if we did not possess a sense of taste or smell discrimination would seem inconceivable in their case alsotrans footnote 8 this classification is now superseded the pea and bean weevilsbruchus pisi and bruchus
