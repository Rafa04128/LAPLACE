preface the art of needlework dates from the earliest record of the worlds history and has also from time immemorial been the support comfort or employment of women of every rank and age day by day it increases its votaries who enlarge and develop its various branches so that any addition and assistance in teaching or learning needlework will be welcomed by the daughters of england wise of heart who work diligently with their hands the recent introduction of point lace has brought a finer and apparently more difficult class of fancy work into general favour ladies may now however confidently commence with our patterns before them to reproduce antique laces for care and patience with a knowledge of point lace stitches are alone required to perfect the beautiful work which as shown in existing specimens of exquisite old lace constitute the chief glory of womens refined industry in past centuries instructions in tatting in embroidery in crochet in knitting and netting in berlin wool work in point lace and guipure dart are prefixed to the pages devoted to these separate branches of needlework the whole work is interspersed with coloured and other patterns in point lace guipure dart tatting embroidery and designs for monograms and initials for marking handkerchiefs and tablelinen the quantity of materials required for each class of work is also given with every pattern the idea of combining a series of minute and exact instructions in fancy needlework with useful patterns was conceived some years ago by one whose life was devoted to the inculcation of the practical duties of womans life and to assisting her sex in their daily work of household management and refinement her great wish was that her book of needlework should be as valuable in its way to her countrywomen as her work upon household management was useful in showing the best mode of providing for the diurnal wants of families other hands have brought to a conclusion her original plans the best attainable workers have contributed to this volume only those who knew the extent of the late mrs beetons design will miss in the pages now before them the touch of a vanished hand sob

work instructions tatting tatting instructions illustration tatting shuttle the needlework called tatting in england frivolit in french and frivolitten in german is a work which seems from all accounts to have been in favour several generations ago modern ingenuity has discovered some ways of improving on the original plan of tatting which was indeed rather a primitive sort of business as first practised to mrs mee one of our most accomplished artistes in all matters connected with the worktable belongs we believe the introduction of the plan of working from the reel instead of the shuttle by this alteration the advantage of the shuttle being constantly kept filled with cotton was gained and the necessity also obviated for frequently joining the thread and to mdlle riego equally distinguished in all details appertaining to the employment of the needle ladies are indebted for an arrangement by which the same thread used in the making of the pattern is used for fastening the work the old plan only provided for the working of the different portions which constituted the pattern and then these portions had to be sewn together with a needle and thread the ingenious workers on the continent have also given much attention of late to the art of tatting and our instructions now printed comprise what we consider the best mode of learning and doing this exceedingly interesting and fashionable work illustration tatting pin tatting differs entirely from crochet and is composed of stitches forming knots it is intended as an imitation of point lace and is especially used for trimming underlinen on account of its strength to make the stitches or knots a small instrument is used called a shuttle this shuttle consists of two oval pieces flat on one side and convex on the other and is made of wood or ivory the two oval pieces are joined together by a strong crosspiece the illustration shows the construction of the shuttle these shuttles are made in ivory pearl tortoiseshell inlaid with pearl and silver they are also manufactured in coloured bone black red and white the best to work with are the pearl for a white shuttle and the inlaid tortoiseshell for a black shuttle the prices vary from sixpence to one shilling and twoandsixpence each in selecting a shuttle be careful to see that the ends close as if dropped it soon becomes unthreaded which is very inconvenient the cotton intended for the work is wound round this shuttle and the thickness of the cotton varies according to the style of work it is better to use the proper tatting cotton because it is stronger than the ordinary kinds this is manufactured by messrs walter evans and co for the purpose their boars head cotton is also frequently used and answers very well shuttles these are made in 3 sizesfinest no 1 no 2 useful medium size no 3 the largest the way to hold the hands take the shuttle in the right hand between the thumb and second finger and allow the forefinger to remain at liberty and rest the under part of the shuttle between the second and third and on the middle finger place the thread round the three middle fingers of the left hand so as to form a loop keeping the second and third fingers a little apart and bring the cotton again between the thumb and forefinger letting the end fall within the palm of the hand while the end of cotton which holds on to the shuttle passes over the thumbnail to make a stitch keep the hands in the position above described pass the shuttle at the back through the loopthat is between the second and third fingers take the end of the shuttle which comes out from the loop between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand and strain the cotton very tightly towards the right when the cotton is drawn through the loop this cotton must not be impeded by the fourth finger it should on the contrary slide over it and be drawn tight it should divide the loop into two parts after this withdraw the second lefthand finger which is above the cotton and pass it again under that cotton so as to draw up the loop a halfstitch is thus formed and must be tightened by being drawn closely to the forefinger and thumb of the left hand for the remaining half of the stitch keep the hands in the same position but instead of letting the cotton fall over the thumb pass this cotton over the back of the hand then let the shuttle fall between the second and third fingers of the left hand in front and take it out again at the back strain the cotton very tightly withdraw the second finger from the loop letting the cotton which is behind the hand sweep over the fingers when this is done guide with the unoccupied fingers of the left hand this second halfstitch up to the other thus completing one stitch the way to make a loop in tatting when a certain number of stitches are made very tightly draw in the loop by straining the cotton until the first stitch touches the last and thus a loop is formed during this process the stitches should be held tightly between the forefinger and thumb the way to make a purl a purl is a small loop of cotton often used as an edging in tatting as for instance round the outer edge of the ovals in tatted insertion no 2 the following is the easiest method of making a purlthe stitches are not made quite closely together at the place where a purl is to be made about onesixth of an inch is left between each this space is left free until the loop is made by uniting the stitches then the small piece of cotton in the space bulges out between the stitches and forms the purl if several are required a small space is left between every two or three stitches according to the desired number care must be taken in that case that the small pieces of cotton left be all of the same length so that the purl may be perfectly even the purl can also be made thus at the same time with the end of thread take the tattingpin or a very large darning needle or knitting needle in the left hand so that the point may come out farther than the row of stitches if then you wish to make a purl throw the cotton on the pin before making the stitch then fasten this stitch and push it at once close to the preceding the pin with the cotton should come above the stitches do not take out the pin before all the purl and all the stitches are completed and joined together joining the work place the tattingpin in the loop that is to be joined and with the hook draw the thread of the loopthat is round the hand through itpass the shuttle through this loop and draw it up tightly close to the stitches a straight or double thread is used to join various parts of the work and forms very beautiful patterns without the straight thread we should be unable to imitate point lace patterns or indeed to execute any designs but those composed of circles ovals c to use this straight thread 2 shuttles are required they should be of different colours sometimes one end of thread is left attached to the reel instead of using the second shuttle in commencing a loop the straight thread is held between the second and third fingers of the left hand about 2 or 3 inches from the work the other shuttle is held as usual in the right hand and the stitches and purls worked with it upon the foundation of the straight thread of the second shuttle tatting 1pine pattern collar in tatting

cotton used by an average worker is found to be two yards to the square inch with a single shuttle three yards to the square inch with two shuttles embroidery instructions the art of embroidering with cotton on linen muslin cambric piqu c is very easy to learn by strictly attending to the following instructions the size of the thread and needle must correspond to that of the material on which you embroider the needle must not be too long and the cotton must be soft messrs walter evans and cos embroidery cotton is the best skilful embroiderers never work over anything because when you tack the material on paper or cloth each stitch shows and if the material is very fine leaves small holes but for those that are learning we should advise them to tack the material to be embroidered upon a piece of toile cire if you work without this place the material straight over the forefinger of the left hand the material must never be held slantways the three other fingers of the left hand hold the work the thumb remains free to give the right position to each stitch the work must always if possible lie so that the outline of the pattern is turned towards the person who works for the sake of greater clearness one part of the following illustrations is given in larger size than nature preparing the patterns is one of the most important things in embroidery for the shape of the patterns is often spoiled merely because they have not been prepared with sufficient care illustration 66scallop illustration 66 shows how to prepare a scallop take thicker cotton than that with which you work never commence with a knot and do not take a thread longer than sixteen or eighteen inches the outlines of the scallops are first traced with short straight stitches in the corners particularly the stitches must be short the space between the outlines is filled with chain stitches as can be seen from illustration they must not be too long otherwise the embroidery will look coarse it is in this way that every pattern to be worked in buttonhole or satin stitch is to be prepared illustration 67double overcast stitch illustration 67 shows the double overcast stitch or buttonhole stitch in a straight line after having traced the outline begin to work from left to right fasten the cotton with a few stitches hold it with the thumb of the left hand under the outline insert the needle downwards above the outline draw it out under the same above the cotton which you hold in the left hand and draw it up repeat for all the stitches in the same manner they must be regular and lie close to one another great care should be taken that the material on which you embroider is not puckered illustration 68overcast stitch illustration 68 overcast stitchthe double overcast and the buttonhole stitches are worked from left to right whilst back stitches knotted and satin stitches are worked from right to left the stitch is worked in the same way as the double overcast only the needle must never be drawn out above but below the cotton with which you work and which you keep down with the thumb of the left hand illustration 69slanting overcast stitch illustration 69the slanting overcast stitch is worked without tracing the outline always inserting the needle downwardsthat is from top to bottom the needle must be inserted in the manner shown in illustrationthat is not straight but slanting insert it a little farther than the last stitch and draw it out close to it the wrong side of the work must show back stitches this sort of stitch is used for the fine outlines in patterns or letter illustration 70back stitch illustration 70this shows the back stitch the working of which is well known it is worked in several rows close to each other illustration 71point crois illustration 72point crois illustrations 71 72 show another kind of back stitch called point crois which is only used on very thin and transparent materials this stitch forms on the wrong side a sort of darned pattern which is seen by transparence on the right side and gives the embroidered pattern a thicker appearance contrasting with the rest of the work see the lower leaves of the flower on illustration 110 for this stitch insert the needle into the material as for the common back stitch draw it out underneath the needle on the opposite outline of the pattern so as to form on the wrong side a slanting line insert the needle again as for common back stitch draw it out slanting at the place marked for the next stitch on the opposite outline as shown in illustration 71 illustration 73 knotted stitch illustration 73 shows the knotted stitch the simplest way of working it is to work two back stitches at a short distance from each other over the same thread the knotted stitch seen in illustration 74 is worked thustake about four threads of the material on the needle draw the needle half out wind the cotton twice round the point of the needle hold it tight with the thumb draw the needle out carefully and insert it at the place where the stitch was begun and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to be worked illustration 74knotted stitch illustration 75knotted stitch the knotted stitch seen on illustration 75 is worked in nearly the same manner as the preceding one before drawing the cotton out of the material hold it tight with the lefthand thumb leave the needle in the same position wind the cotton twice round it turn the needle from left to right so follow the direction of the arrow that its point arrives where the cotton was drawn out marked by a cross in illustration insert the needle there and draw it out at the place of the next stitch illustrations 76 77raised satin stitch is principally used for blossoms flowers leaves letters c after having traced the outlines of the pattern fill the space left between them with chain stitches in a direction different from that in which the pattern is to be embroidered begin at the point of the leaf working from right to left make short straight stitches always illustration 76raised satin stitch inserting the needle close above the outline and drawing it out below the leaves on the flowers as well as on the branches must be begun from the point because they thus acquire a better shape if you wish to work a leaf divided in the middle as seen in illustration 77 you must trace the veining before you fill it with chain stitches then begin at one point of the leaf and work first one half and then the other illustration 77raised satin stitch illustration 78point de plume illustration 78 shows the socalled point de plume on a scalloped leaf it is worked like the satin stitch only the needle is drawn through the material in a slanting direction illustration 79point de minute illustration 79 point de minutethis stitch is often used instead of satin stitch when the patterns must appear raised wind the cotton several times round the point of the needle which is inserted into the material half its length the number of times the cotton is to be wound round the needle depends on the length of the pattern hold fast the windings with the thumb of the left hand draw the needle and the cotton through the windings insert the needle into the material at the same place and draw it out at the place where the next stitch is to begin illustration 80ladder stitch illustration 81ladder stitch illustrations 80 81 show the ladder stitch often used in ornamental embroidery trace first the outlines as seen in illustrations mark also the cross stitches between the outlines so that the first touch the outlines only at both ends the outlines are embroidered in overcast stitch or double overcast the material is cut away underneath the ladder stitch between the outlines we have now shown the different kinds of stitches used in embroidery the following illustrations show them used for different patterns illustration 82buttonhole stitch scallop illustration 83buttonhole

described take care to have the stitches even and regular the scallops must be wide in the centre and very fine at both ends illustrations 86 87 buttonholes and eyeletsthis kind of embroidery is used only in round or long patterns trace first the outline of the hole cut away a small round piece of material not too close to the outlines when the buttonhole is very small merely insert the point of the scissors or a stiletto into the material fold the edge of the material back with the needle and work the hole in overcast stitch inserting the needle into the empty place in the centre and drawing it out under the outline some buttonholes are worked separately sometimes they are in a row if so take care to begin to work each buttonhole at the place where it touches the next in the following buttonholes the outside must be traced double so as to reach as far as the next one but each buttonhole is finished at once illustration 86 shows a buttonhole worked round in buttonhole stitch 87 an

buttonholes are worked like the others only they are prepared as can be seen in illustration 89 so as to mark the thickness the stitches must gradually get narrower or wider and be worked very close to each other illustration 90leaf in raised satin stitch illustrations 90 91 two leaves in raised satin stitchin a leaf like the one seen in 90 work first the outline and veining in overcast stitch

intervals and each stitch begins halfway up the one before and after it illustration 95leaf raised illustration 96leaf raised illustration 97raised leaf illustrations 95 to 97 leaf in raised

edging takes up so much space to write that we think it better to leave it to the judgment of the worker it will be seen by the engraving when it is necessary to work a double long or long stitch or a stitch of single or double crochet and the number of chain stitches between must be just sufficient to make the circle perfect the best way is to cut a round of blue paper and place them on it from the engraving then sew them together and tack them to the paper and work the 1st row of the edging before removing the paper illustration 264doyley no 3 265doyley no 4 material messrs walter evans and

all good housewives of any civilised country it is reckoned an indispensable accomplishment knitting schools have been established of late years both in ireland and scotland and her majesty the queen has herself set an example of this industry as well as largely patronised the industrial knitters of scotland of the rudiments of this useful art many ladies are at present ignorant it is in the hope of being useful to these that the following instructions are offered to knit two three four or five needles and either thread cotton silk or wool are required knitting needles are made of steel of ivory or of wood the size to be used depends entirely upon the material employed whether thread cotton silk single or double wool for knitting as the size of the needles depends upon that of the cotton a knitting gauge is used see no 287 the gauge page 290 is the exact size of messrs h walker and cos knitting gauge our readers will remark that english and foreign gauges differ very essentially the finest size of german needles for example is no 1 which is the size of the coarsest english wooden or ivory needle straight knitting is usually done with two needles only for round knitting for socks stockings c three four and five needles are employed illustration 287knitting gauge 288casting on this term is used for placing the first row or round of knitting stitches on the needlescasting them onand is done in two waysby knitting on the stitches or as follows hold the thread between the first and second finger of the left hand throw it over the thumb and first finger so as to form a loop and pass the needle in the loop throw the thread lightly round the needle pass it through the loop and draw up the thread this forms the first stitch see no 288 illustration 288casting on 289to knit on illustration 289knitting on take the needle on which the stitches are cast in the left hand and another needle in the right handobserve the position of the hands no 289 hold the lefthand needle between the thumb and third finger leaving the first finger free to move the points of the needles the wonderful sense of touch in the first or index finger is so delicate that an experienced knitter can work without ever looking at her fingers by the help of this touch onlyin fact knitting becomes a purely mechanical labour and as such is most useful insert the point of the righthand needle in the loop or stitch formed on the lefthand needle bring the thread once round turning the point of the needle in front under the stitch bringing up the thread thrown over which in its turn becomes a stitch and is placed on the lefthand needle 290simple knitting plain illustration 290plain knitting pass the righthand needle into the 1st stitch of the lefthand needle at the back throw the thread forward and with the first finger pass the point of the needle under the stitch in forming a fresh stitch with the thread already thrown over as in knitting on only instead of placing the newlyformed stitch on the lefthand needle leave it on the righthand needle and let the stitch drop off the point of the lefthand needle continue thus until all the stitches are taken from the left to the righthand needle and the row is then complete 291to purl pearl or seam seaming or purling a stitch is done by taking up the stitch in front instead of at the back throwing the thread over and knitting the stitch as in plain knitting but before beginning to purl the thread must be brought in front of the needle and if a plain stitch follows the thread is passed back after the purl stitch is made see no 291 illustration 291purling 292to increase increasing or making a stitch is done by throwing the thread once round the needle and in the next row knitting it as an ordinary stitch illustration 292increasing 293to decrease this is done in two ways firstly taking up two stitches and knitting them together as one secondly by taking up a stitch without knitting it called slipping then by knitting the following stitch in the usual way and then slipping the 1st unknitted over the 2nd knitted see no 293 when it is necessary to decrease two stitches at once proceed thusslip one knit two stitches together then slip the unknitted stitch over the two knitted together illustration 293decreasing 294round knitting to knit a round four or five needles are used it is thus that stockings socks cuffs mittens c are made to knit with four needles cast on say 32 stitches upon one needle insert a second needle in the last stitch of the first and cast on 30 stitches proceed in a similar way with a third needle but casting on 28 only when this is done knit the two extra stitches on the first needle on to the last this makes 30 stitches upon each needle and completes the round 295casting off knit two stitches and with the lefthand needle slip the first stitch over the second continue this to the end of the row notethe last knitted row before casting off should be knitted loosely 296to pick up a stitch this is done by taking up the thread between two stitches and forming a stitch with it the following designs of new stitches can be used for a variety of work 297peacocks tail pattern needles wood or ivory messrs walter evans and cos knitting cotton illustration 297peacocks tail pattern cast on a number of stitches divisible by nine as it takes nine

materials are simple while the effects produced by good netting are most elegant and of great durability one great advantage of netting is that each stitch is finished and independent of the next so that if an accident happens to one stitch it does not as in crochet or knitting spoil the whole work netting so easy to do is most difficult to describe the materials required area nettingneedle and mesh see illustration no 302 these are made of bone of wood of ivory and most commonly of steel the wood bone and ivory are only used for netting wool the steel for silk cotton c the needle is filled by passing the end of the thread through the little hole at the lefthand point and tying it then the thread is wound on the needle as on a tatting shuttle the needles are numbered from 12 to 24 these last are extremely fine the meshes correspond to the sizes of the needles and are made of the same materials the larger the size of the stitch required the thicker the mesh must be selected indeed large hat meshes are often used for some patterns a stirrup to slip over the foot to which the foundation is attached is required by those who do not use a netting cushion placed before them on the table and heavily weighted to this the foundation is fastened the stirrup is made of a loop of ribbon to which the foundation is tied some ladies work a pretty stirrup of the exact shape of a horsemans stirrup a loop of ribbon is passed through this and the foundation fixed as before illustration 302needle and mesh 303to net place the mesh under the thread between the thumb and finger of the left hand it must rest on the middle of the finger and be held only by the thumb see illustration no 303 take the needle in the right hand pass the thread over the middle and ring finger and over the mesh pass the needle upwards and behind the mesh in the large loop which forms the thread round the fingers and at the same time through the first stitch or loop of the foundation draw the needle out retaining the loops on the fingers and dropping them off the little finger being the last to release the thread as the thread tightens and the knot is firm the loop on the little finger should be drawn up quickly and smartly the next stitches are precisely similar and row upon row is formed in the same manner having learnt the stitch the next task is to make a foundation tie a large loop of strong thread on the stirrup ribbon and net fifty stitches into this loop then net four or five rows and the foundation is ready illustration 303netting simple netting as above explained forms diamonds or lozenges when a piece of netting is finished it is cut off the foundation and the little ends of thread that held the stitches are drawn out 304square netting is done precisely in the same manner as plain netting only begin from one stitch then net two stitches into this first and increase by making two in the last loop of every row as soon as the right number of stitches is complete diminish exactly in the same way by netting two stitches as one at the end of each row until one stitch alone remains these squares are used for guipure dart and for darning on 305round netting is nearly similar to plain netting a little difference exists in the way of passing the needle through the stitch this is shown in no 305 after having passed the needle through the stitch it is drawn out and passed from above into the loop just made this stitch is very effective for purses illustration 305round netting 306diamond netting is often called pointed netting and is made by netting from one stitch increasing one stitch at the end of each row and decreasing in the same way as described at page 303 307to net rounds to form a circle as for a purse the needle must pass through the first stitch keeping the last three or four on the mesh and removing this when required by the work 308english netting is made as followsnet a row of plain netting begin the second row by netting the second stitch then net the first repeat always passing by one stitch and taking it up 3rd rowplain 4th rowbegin by a plain stitch then continue as in the 2nd row 5th rowplain illustration 308english netting 309lace edging begin by one stitch and net two in one at the end of each row until as many stitches are required for the narrowest part of the edge increase one then in the two loops until the point of the edge or scallop is reached at the next row leave the squares which form the point and begin from 310open lace this kind of edging is made with two meshes of different sizes and extremely fine

for couvrettes doyleys c the mesh must be three times as long as that employed for the square netting make 12 stitches in the first stitch of the edge pass over 8 make 12 in the ninth and repeat then take the mesh used for the square netting and net one stitch in each stitch take a still smaller mesh and complete by adding another row of one stitch in each stitch this border forms a very appropriate edging for all articles in square netting as couvrettes mats also for trimming guipure dart work and should be netted in the row of holes edging the work two sets of shells must be worked at the corners when a little fulness is required illustration 311shell border knitting and netting patterns 312knitted sock for a child materials for 1 pair 1 ounce of single berlin wool 1 yard of

then knit with white wool 31 rounds alternately 2 stitches knitted 2 stitches purled then work the foot in the diamond pattern in the same way as usual for a stocking the heel is formed by leaving 23 stitches on each side the seam stitch and knitted backwards and forwards in the diamond pattern at the toe decrease so that the decreasings form a seam on both sides of the toe this is obtained by knitting the 3rd and 4th stitches of the 1st needle together on the 2nd needle slip the 4th stitch before the last knit the next stitch and draw the slipped stitch over the knitted one decrease in the same manner on the other 2 needles of this round repeat these decreasings exactly in the same direction and at the same places so that there are always 4 stitches between the 2 decreasings at the end and at the beginning of 2 needles they always take place after 3 or 2 plain rounds and at last after 1 plain round the remaining stitches are knitted off 2 and 2 together to complete the sock the

side where hangs the thread with which you work take the back chain of the 7 selvedge stitches of the part you have just knitted on a separate needle and knit another part which must have 15 rows and the 1st row of which is knitted repeat 10 times more from the stitches of several parts can be taken on the same needle so as not to be hindered in working by too many needles when the 12th part is completed take the selvedge stitches on the left hand on another needle cast them off together with the cast on stitches of the 1st part and fasten the silk thread then take the 7 righthand selvedge stitches of one black part on a needle take the red silk on which the beads have been strung and work 15 rows on these stitches the 1st row from the wrong side and therefore purled in the 1st as well as in all the other purled rows the last stitch must be purled together with the next stitch of the next black part in the purled rows moreover excepting in the first and last one a bead must be worked in after casting off the 2nd 4th and 6th stitches the stitch must be worked by inserting the needle into the back part and in drawing through the silk which has been thrown forward let the bead slide through the stitch so that it is on the right side of the work in the following knitted row the needle must also be inserted into the back part of the bead stitch when 12 such red parts have been completed work again 12 black parts on the selvedge stitch of the same in which the beads are not knitted in but sewn on afterwards when the purse is completed then work 3 times more alternately 12 red and 12 black parts when the last 12 black parts have been completed cast off the stitches of the last black part together with the selvedge stitches the 1st on the wrong side the stitches of the 6th part are cast off in the same manner together with the selvedge stitches of the 7th the red parts which remain to be worked on the black part are thus lessened by 2 the 2nd 3rd and 4th and the 7th 8th and 9th of these parts must be by 6 rows longer then gather all the stitches and selvedge stitches of the 10 parts on 2 needles in such a manner that the 2 black parts the stitches and

where the end of wool hangs down leaving it unnoticed for the present inserting the needle into the back chain of the stitch the selvedge stitch which is next to the caston stitch remains therefore unworked upon and knit on these a new part which must have 13 rows the first row is knitted and in this row work 2 stitches in the first stitch one purled and one knitted so that this new part is equally six stitches wide repeat 8 times more from after having worked several parts the stitches can of course be taken on the same needle so as not to increase the number of needles when the 10th part is com pleted take the selvedge stitches of the lefthand side of the same on a separate needle cast them off with the caston stitches of the first part and fasten the wool then take the 6

stitches the slipped stitch and the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward before the 3rd single black stitch are then knitted together so that the crossed stitches are placed in opposite directions the three black stitches which are knitted off together as 1 stitch in the next row form the middle line of the front gore and are continued in a straight line to the point of the gore the crossing takes place twice in this row but now the black stitch is slipped first after the 24th stitch knit together the following stitch with the stitch formed by throwing the wool forward then continue to work in common brioche stitch to the other front part where the gore begins before the 24th stitch from the end in the next row which is worked in purled brioche stitch with black wool take up the black loop between two purple ribs after the 11th stitch purl it so as to form the stitch which is missing at that place the 3 slipped stitches in the preceding row are purled together as

worked in patterns by hand which are joined by various stitches forming a groundwork also the result of the needle above pillow lace is entirely worked on the pillow or cushion the pattern and ground being produced at the same time pillow lace is sometimes correctly called bone or bobbin lace but it appears that the distinction has never been very nicely observed either by laceworkers or lacetraders many sorts which are really pillow lace being called point on account of some peculiarity in the stitch or pattern the requisites for producing lace in perfection are the dexterity and taste of the workers and the goodness of the material to produce many beautiful fabrics a mechanical dexterity alone suffices but in lacemaking the worker must have some artistic talent even when supplied with designs for any one can perceive that deviations from the design are easily made and that the slightest alteration by a worker wanting in taste will spoil the whole piece of workmanship

cloth which though transparent is very strong the price is 1s 6d per yard fine leather is the material upon which bought patterns are usually traced and is decidedly more pleasant to work on than is any other material in selecting patterns ladies should choose those traced upon green leather in preference to scarlet or buff as green is better for the eyesight than any other colour illustration

imitation of the point lace work of the fifteenth century point lace cords resemble the satin stitch embroidery in their close regular smoothness the price is 1s per hank and they are of various thicknesses from the size of a coarse crochet thread up to that of a thick piping cord these cords are used to ornament the braid and are closely sewn on the braid following its every outline and serve as beading to the edging being always sewn on the outer edge alone the finer kinds of this cord are used in place of braid where very light work is needed as in the point lace alphabet which forms the frontispiece of this work directions for laying on the cord when employed as braid are given on page 500 when used as a finish only and to impart the raised appearance of venice and spanish

in reverse rows before cutting off the braid run a few stitches across it to prevent it widening joins should be avoided but when a join is indispensable stitch the braid together open and turn back the ends and stitch each portion down separately when passing the thread from one part to another run along the centre of the braid allowing the stitches to show as little as possible in commencing make a few stitches leaving the end of the thread on the wrong side and cutting it off afterwards in fastening off make a tight buttonhole stitch run on three stitches bring the needle out at the back and cut off having now completed our list of materials we can proceed to lay on the braid illustration 442mode of placing the braid to place the braidno 442 shows the design traced upon paper or tracing cloth and lightly tacked to a foundation of leather or toile cire run on a straight line of braid for the lower edge with fine stitches working as shown from left to right take another piece of braid or the other end of the same piece and begin to lay the braid by running stitches in its centre keeping it as smooth and even as possible the outer edge presents no difficulty but the inner edge will not lie evenly without being drawn in by a needle and thread as followsthread a no 9 needle with no 12 mecklenburg thread about 20 inches long fasten the thread to one point and insert the needle in and out of the edge of the braid as if for fine gathering this thread when drawn up will keep the braid in its place two or three fastening off stitches should be worked when each circle half circle or rounded curve of a pattern is finished as the drawing or gathering thread remains in the work and forms an important though unseen part of its structure as much of the beauty of point lace depends upon the manner of placing the braid ladies cannot bestow too much pains upon this part of the work which is a little troublesome to beginners many fancy shops now undertake this braidplacing for ladies who can have their own pattern braided and commenced or braided alone at trifling expense among these may be mentioned the following housesgoubaud 30 henriettastreet

stitches points has of late been applied to every stitch executed with mecklenburg thread and many stitches are erroneously named by modern writers as there are more than one hundred stitches employed in this beautiful art much study and opportunity of seeing specimens of old point lace is required to give a novice any idea of the various kinds of point lace but by attention to the following stitches the rudiments of the art may be easily acquired and very beautiful lace produced the first stitch is point de bruxelles or brussels lace stitch this stitch as may be clearly seen in illustration no 433 is a simple buttonhole stitch worked loosely and with great regularity the whole beauty of brussels lace depends upon the evenness of the stitches this stitch is sometimes employed

usually worked in what are called raleigh bars see page 477 but this lace has sometimes for groundwork point de venise an easy mode of working this handsome lace is to trace the design upon very fine

was a lace made of thin vellum covered with gold silver or silk thread and the word guipure derives its name from the silk when thus twisted round vellum being called by that name in process of time the use of vellum was discontinued and a cotton material replaced it guipure lace was called intelle cartisane in england in the sixteenth century various modern laces are called guipure but the word is misapplied since guipure lace is that kind only where one thread is twisted round another thread or another substance as in the ancient guipure dart in every design where lace can be introduced guipure dart will be found useful it looks particularly well when mounted upon quilted silk or satin the squares when worked finely look well as toiletcushions or if worked in coarser thread make admirable couvrettes and as covers for eiderdown silk quilts are very elegant guipure squares should be connected by guipure lace crochet or tatting or they may be edged with narrow guipure lace and joined at the corners only when placed over coloured silk or satin thus arranged a sofacushion appears in alternate squares of plain and lacecovered silk a ruche of ribbon and fall of lace to correspond completes this pretty mounting not one of the least important attractions of guipure dart is the speed with which it is worked and the ease with which fresh patterns are designed by skilful workers guipure dart is an imitation of the celebrated ancient guipure lace and is worked in raised and intersected patterns upon a square network of linen thread mecklenburg thread of various sizes being used for this purpose the needles employed are blunt and have large eyes to admit the linen thread materials required one frame of wire covered with silk ribbon one square of mecklenburg thread net fillet either coarse or fine mecklenburg thread nettingneedles and meshes of various sizes the netted foundation or fillet upon which this elegant work is embroidered can be made by ladies very easily and at much less cost than when bought ready made the square is worked by netting with coarse no 2 or fine no10 thread over a mesh measuring threequarters of an inch or more in rows backwards and forwards begin with 2 stitches and increase 1 at the end of every row till you have one more stitch than is required for the number of holes thus if a square of 26 holes is required continue to increase up to 27 stitches then decrease 1 at the end of every row till 2 stitches only remain the last 2 stitches are knotted together without forming a fresh stitch the completed foundation is laced upon the frame taking the lacing cotton through the double edge formed by the increased and decreased stitches if the four corners of the netting are tied at each corner of the frame before beginning the lacing that operation is greatly facilitated the netting should be laced as tightly as possible it being far easier to darn on than when loose illustration 503frame for guipure dart ladies who wish to excel in working guipure dart should practise each of the stitches until they attain perfect regularity and quickness in their execution two or three hours devoted to this in the first instance will not be time wasted as the most elaborate pattern will be worked with ease as soon as the stitches are mastered the mecklenburg thread of messrs walter evans and co of derby will be found

the coarsest and no 20 the finest the principal stitches used in guipure dart are point desprit point de toile point de feston point de reprise point de bruxelles and wheels and stars point desprit is worked with finer cotton than the foundation say no 10 on a foundation of no 6 it consists of a succession of small loops as will be seen clearly in the illustration the learner should begin from the mark no 503 and working a row of loops the length required turn the frame and work loops on the opposite half of each square intersecting the first worked loops in the centre of each intervening bar of netting a careful examination of nos 503 and 506 will explain this more clearly than is possible in words illustration 504point desprit point de toile or linen stitch is plain darning under and over each thread this forms a fine close groundwork and is much used in guipure dart care should be taken to keep the same number of stitches in each square both along and across the number of threads shown in illustration no 504 is 4 only but 6 and even 8 are used in many netted foundations in fine patterns illustration 505point de toile point de feston is worked by a series of overcast stitches as seen by illustration 506 which clearly shows the manner of working the frame is turned at each stitch the stitches are taken across the squares and increase in length at the top of the square

berlin work instructions berlin work includes every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas with wool silk or beads the principal stitches used are common cross stitch gobelin stitch leviathan stitch raised or velvet stitch tent stitch and others the materials and needle must always be carefully chosen of a corresponding size for common cross stitch and raised stitch penelope canvas must be used for small articles such as slippers bags or borders single berlin wool is preferable for larger ones fleecy wool or double berlin wool the latter however is much more expensive for gobelin stitch and tent stitch undivided canvas not penelope is required purse silk is often used for the latter it is more brilliant than floss silk or filoselle floss silk is generally used for other stitches because it covers the thread of the canvas better than purse silk it is however often replaced by filoselle which is a much cheaper material moss wool is hardly ever used before beginning to work upon a piece of canvas the raw edges must be hemmed or sewn over with wool care must be taken not to crumple the canvas in the course of the work it is best to roll one end of the canvas upon a round piece of deal while the other end is kept down upon the table with a lead cushion handsome artistic patterns should always be worked in a frame when you undertake to work a large pattern begin in the centre and complete one half before you commence the other always work the stitches in the same direction from the top downwardsthis is very essential to the beauty and regularity of the pattern always begin with the colour which is used the oftenest those colours that lose their dye in working must be put in last when the pattern is finished begin the grounding the wool must not be drawn too tightly otherwise the threads of the canvas appear if the wool is too coarse for the canvas one long stitch is to be made from left to right as far as the particular colour is to be worked and over this long stitch cross back in the usual way the plainest stitch in berlin wool work is the common cross stitch illustrations 577 to 584 show varieties of the same we now proceed in the following pages to show by description in writing and by most careful illustration all the stitches which are used in berlin work these are numerous but neither too great in number nor too simple or too elaborate in execution for those who aspire to become berlin workers illustration 577common cross stitch illustration 577the common cross stitch is worked in rows backwards and forwards over 2 threads in height

needles as there are colours in the work make first a slanting stitch as for the beginning of the common cross stitch but instead of drawing out the needle straight under the place where it was inserted draw it out exactly at the same place so as to form a slanting stitch on the right and on the wrong side then begin to work over 1 mesh insert the needle above it and draw it out in a slanting direction underneath on the wrong side of the work a regular cross stitch is formed illustration 589 shows 2 rows of velvet stitch completed and 2 rows being worked the first of the latter is yet on the mesh the second being worked so as to show the position of the wool upon the mesh observe that the rows of the velvet stitch are worked upwards and that 2 meshes are necessary because the
