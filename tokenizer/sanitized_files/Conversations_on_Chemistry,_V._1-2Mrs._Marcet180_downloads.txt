typographical errors are listed at the end of the text conversations on chemistry in which the elements of that science are familiarly explained and illustrated by experiments in two volumes the fifth edition revised corrected and considerably enlarged vol i on simple bodies london printed for longman hurst rees orme and brown paternosterrow 1817 printed by a strahan printersstreet london advertisement the author in this fifth edition has endeavoured to give an account of the principal discoveries which have been made within the last four years in chemical science and of the various important applications such as the gaslights and the minerslamp to which they have given rise but in regard to doctrines or principles the work has undergone no material alteration london july 1817 preface in venturing to offer to the public and more particularly to the female sex an introduction to chemistry the author herself a woman conceives that some explanation may be required and she feels it the more necessary to apologise for the present undertaking as her knowledge of the subject is but recent and as she can have no real claims to the title of chemist on attending for the first time experimental lectures the author found it almost impossible to derive any clear or satisfactory information from the rapid demonstrations which are usually and perhaps necessarily crowded into popular courses of this kind but frequent opportunities having afterwards occurred of conversing with a friend on the subject of chemistry and of repeating a variety of experiments she became better acquainted with the principles of that science and began to feel highly interested in its pursuit it was then that she perceived in attending the excellent lectures delivered at the royal institution by the present professor of chemistry the great advantage which her previous knowledge of the subject slight as it was gave her over others who had not enjoyed the same means of private instruction every fact or experiment attracted her attention and served to explain some theory to which she was not a total stranger and she had the gratification to find that the numerous and elegant illustrations for which that school is so much distinguished seldom failed to produce on her mind the effect for which they were intended hence it was natural to infer that familiar conversation was in studies of this kind a most useful auxiliary source of information and more especially to the female sex whose education is seldom calculated to prepare their minds for abstract ideas or scientific language as however there are but few women who have access to this mode of instruction and as the author was not acquainted with any book that could prove a substitute for it she thought that it might be useful for beginners as well as satisfactory to herself to trace the steps by which she had acquired her little stock of chemical knowledge and to record in the form of dialogue those ideas which she had first derived from conversation but to do this with sufficient method and to fix upon a mode of arrangement was an object of some difficulty after much hesitation and a degree of embarrassment which probably the most competent chemical writers have often felt in common with the most superficial a mode of division was adopted which though the most natural does not always admit of being strictly pursuedit is that of treating first of the simplest bodies and then gradually rising to the most intricate compounds it is not the authors intention to enter into a minute vindication of this plan but whatever may be its advantages or inconveniences the method adopted in this work is such that a young pupil who should occasionally recur to it with a view to procure information on particular subjects might often find it obscure or unintelligible for its various parts are so connected with each other as to form an uninterrupted chain of facts and reasonings which will appear sufficiently clear and consistent to those only who may have patience to go through the whole work or have previously devoted some attention to the subject it will no doubt be observed that in the course of these conversations remarks are often introduced which appear much too acute for the young pupils by whom they are supposed to be made of this fault the author is fully aware but in order to avoid it it would have been necessary either to omit a variety of useful illustrations or to submit to such minute explanations and frequent repetitions as would have rendered the work tedious and therefore less suited to its intended purpose in writing these pages the author was more than once checked in her progress by the apprehension that such an attempt might be considered by some either as unsuited to the ordinary pursuits of her sex or illjustified by her own recent and imperfect knowledge of the subject but on the one hand she felt encouraged by the establishment of those public institutions open to both sexes for the dissemination of philosophical knowledge which clearly prove that the general opinion no longer excludes women from an acquaintance with the elements of science and on the other she flattered herself that whilst the impressions made upon her mind by the wonders of nature studied in this new point of view were still fresh and strong she might perhaps succeed the better in communicating to others the sentiments she herself experienced the reader will soon perceive in perusing this work that he is often supposed to have previously acquired some slight knowledge of natural philosophy a circumstance indeed which appears very desirable the authors original intention was to commence this work by a small tract explaining on a plan analogous to this the most essential rudiments of that science this idea she has since abandoned but the manuscript was ready and might perhaps have been printed at some future period had not an elementary work of a similar description under the tide of scientific dialogues been pointed out to her which on a rapid perusal she thought very ingenious and well calculated to answer its intended

acquired some elementary notions of natural philosophy i am going to propose to you another branch of science to which i am particularly anxious that you should devote a share of your attention this is chemistry which is so closely connected with natural philosophy that the study of the one must be incomplete without some knowledge of the other for it is obvious that we can derive but a very imperfect idea of bodies from the study of the general laws by which they are governed if we remain totally ignorant of their intimate nature caroline to confess the truth mrs b i am not disposed to form a very favourable idea of chemistry nor do i expect to derive much entertainment from it i prefer the sciences which exhibit nature on a grand scale to those that are confined to the minuti of petty details can the studies which we have lately pursued the general properties of matter or the revolutions of the heavenly bodies be compared to the mixing up of a few insignificant drugs i grant however there may be entertaining experiments in chemistry and should not dislike to try some of them the distilling for instance of lavender or rose water mrs b i rather imagine my dear caroline that your want of taste for chemistry proceeds from the very limited idea you entertain of its object you confine the chemists laboratory to the narrow precincts of the apothecarys and perfumers shops whilst it is subservient to an immense variety of other useful purposes besides my dear chemistry is by no means confined to works of art nature also has her laboratory which is the universe and there she is incessantly employed in chemical operations you are surprised caroline but i assure you that the most wonderful and the most interesting phenomena of nature are almost all of them produced by chemical powers what bergman in the introduction to his history of chemistry has said of this science will give you a more just and enlarged idea of it the knowledge of nature may be divided he observes into three periods the first was that in which the attention of men was occupied in learning the external forms and characters of objects and this is called natural history in the second they considered the effects of bodies acting on each other by their mechanical power as their weight and motion and this constitutes the science of natural philosophy the third period is that in which the properties and mutual action of the elementary parts of bodies was investigated this last is the science of chemistry and i have no doubt you will soon agree with me in thinking it the most interesting you may easily conceive therefore that without entering into the minute details of practical chemistry a woman may obtain such a knowledge of the science as will not only throw an interest on the common occurrences of life but will enlarge the sphere of her ideas and render the contemplation of nature a source of delightful instruction caroline if this is the case i have certainly been much mistaken in the notion i had formed of chemistry i own that i thought it was chiefly confined to the knowledge and preparation of medicines mrs b that is only a branch of chemistry which is called pharmacy and though the study of it is certainly of great importance to the world at large it belongs exclusively to professional men and is therefore the last that i should advise you to pursue emily but did not the chemists formerly employ themselves in search of the philosophers stone or the secret of making gold mrs b these were a particular set of misguided philosophers who dignified themselves with the name of alchemists to distinguish their pursuits from those of the common chemists whose studies were confined to the knowledge of medicines but since that period chemistry has undergone so complete a revolution that from an obscure and mysterious art it is now become a regular and beautiful science to which art is entirely subservient it is true however that we are indebted to the alchemists for many very useful discoveries which sprung from their fruitless attempts to make gold and which undoubtedly have proved of infinitely greater advantage to mankind than all their chimerical pursuits the modern chemists instead of directing their ambition to the vain attempt of producing any of the original substances in nature rather aim at analysing and imitating her operations and have sometimes succeeded in forming combinations or effecting decompositions no instances of which occur in the chemistry of nature they have little reason to regret their inability to make gold whilst by their innumerable inventions and discoveries they have so greatly stimulated industry and facilitated labour as prodigiously to increase the luxuries as well as the necessaries of life emily but i do not understand by what means chemistry can facilitate labour is not that rather the province of the mechanic mrs b there are many ways by which labour may be rendered more easy independently of mechanics but even the machine the most wonderful in its effects the steamengine cannot be understood without the assistance of chemistry in agriculture a chemical knowledge of the nature of soils and of vegetation is highly useful and in those arts which relate to the comforts and conveniences of life it would be endless to enumerate the advantages which result from the study of this science caroline but pray tell us more precisely in what manner the discoveries of chemists have proved so beneficial to society mrs b that would be an injudicious anticipation for you would not comprehend the nature of such discoveries and useful applications as well as you will do hereafter without a due regard to method we cannot expect to make any progress in chemistry i wish to direct your observations chiefly to the chemical operations of nature but those of art are certainly of too high importance to pass unnoticed we shall therefore allow them also some share of our attention emily well then let us now set to work regularly i am very anxious to begin mrs b the object of chemistry is to obtain a knowledge of the intimate nature of bodies and of their mutual action on each other you find therefore caroline that this is no narrow or confined science which comprehends every thing material within our sphere caroline on the contrary it must be inexhaustible and i am a loss to conceive how any proficiency can be made in a science whose objects are so numerous mrs b if every individual substance were formed of different materials the study of chemistry would indeed be endless but you must observe that the various bodies in nature are composed of certain elementary principles which are not very numerous caroline yes i know that all bodies are composed of fire air earth and water i learnt that many years ago mrs b but you must now endeavour to forget it i have already informed you what a great change chemistry has undergone since it has become a regular science within these thirty years especially it has experienced an entire revolution and it is now proved that neither fire air earth nor water can be called elementary bodies for an elementary body is one that has never been decomposed that is to say separated into other substances and fire air earth and water are all of them susceptible of decomposition emily i thought that decomposing a body was dividing it into its minutest parts and if so i do not understand why an elementary substance is not capable of being decomposed as well as any other mrs b you have misconceived the idea of decomposition it is very different from mere division the latter simply reduces a body into parts but the former separates it into the various ingredients or materials of which it is composed if we were to take a loaf of bread and separate the several ingredients of which it is made the flour the yeast the salt and the water it would be very different from cutting or crumbling the loaf into pieces emily i understand you now very well to decompose a body is to separate from each other the various elementary substances of which it consists caroline but flour water and other materials of bread according to our definition are not elementary substances mrs b no my dear i mentioned bread rather as a familiar comparison to illustrate the idea than as an example the elementary substances of which a body is composed are called the constituent parts of that body in decomposing it therefore we separate its constituent parts if on the contrary we divide a body by chopping it to pieces or even by grinding or pounding it to the finest powder each of these small particles will still consist of a portion of the several constituent parts of the whole body these are called the integrant parts do you understand the difference emily yes i think perfectly we decompose a body into its constituent parts and divide it into its integrant parts mrs b exactly so if therefore a body consists of only one kind of substance though it may be divided into its integrant parts it is not possible to decompose it such bodies are therefore called simple or elementary as they are the elements of which all other bodies are composed compound bodies are such as consist of more than one of these elementary principles caroline but do not fire air earth and water consist each of them but of one kind of substance mrs b no my dear they are every one of them susceptible of being separated into various simple bodies instead of four chemists now reckon upwards of forty elementary substances the existence of most of these is established by the clearest experiments but in regard to a few of them particularly the most subtle agents of nature heat light and electricity there is yet much uncertainty and i can only give you the opinion which seems most probably deduced from the latest discoveries after i have given you a list of the elementary bodies classed according to their properties we shall proceed to examine each of them separately and then consider them in their combinations with each other excepting the more general agents of nature heat light and electricity it would seem that the simple form of bodies is that of a metal caroline you astonish me i thought the metals were only one class of minerals and that there were besides earths stones rocks acids alkalies vapours fluids and the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdoms mrs b you have made a tolerably good enumeration though i fear not arranged in the most scientific order all these bodies however it is now strongly believed may be ultimately resolved into metallic substances your surprise at this circumstance is not singular as the decomposition of some of them which has been but lately accomplished has excited the wonder of the whole philosophical world but to return to the list of simple bodiesthese being usually found in combination with oxygen i shall class them according to their properties when so combined this will i think facilitate their future investigation emily pray what is oxygen mrs b a simple body at least one that is supposed to be so as it has never been decomposed it is always found united with the negative electricity it will be one of the first of the elementary bodies whose properties i shall explain to you and as you will soon perceive it is one of the most important in nature but it would be irrelevant to enter upon this subject at present we must now confine our attention to the enumeration and classification of the simple bodies in general they may be arranged as follows class i comprehending the imponderable agents viz heat or caloric light electricity class ii comprehending agents capable of uniting with inflammable bodies and in most instances of effecting their combustion oxygen chlorine iodine footnote it has been questioned by some eminent chemists whether these two last agents should not be classed among the inflammable bodies as they are capable of combining with oxygen as well as with inflammable bodies but they seem to be more distinctly characterised by their property of supporting combustion than by any other quality class iii comprehending bodies capable of uniting with oxygen and forming with it various compounds this class may be divided as follows division 1 hydrogen forming water division 2 bodies forming acids nitrogen forming nitric acid sulphur forming sulphuric acid phosphorus forming phosphoric acid carbon forming carbonic acid boracium forming boracic acid fluorium forming fluoric acid muriatium forming muriatic acid division 3 metallic bodies forming alkalies potassium forming potash sodium forming soda ammonium forming ammonia division 4 metallic bodies forming earths calcium or metal forming lime magnium forming magnesia barium forming barytes strontium forming strontites silicium forming silex alumium forming alumine yttrium forming yttria glucium forming glucina zirconium forming zirconi footnote of all these earths three or four only have as yet been distinctly decomposed division 5 metals either naturally metallic or yielding their oxygen to carbon or to heat alone subdivision 1 malleable metals gold platina palladium silver mercury tin copper iron lead nickel zinc footnote these first four metals have commonly been distinguished by the appellation of perfect or noble metals on account of their possessing the characteristic properties of ductility malleability inalterability and great specific gravity in an eminent degree footnote mercury in its liquid state cannot of course be called a malleable metal but when frozen it possesses a considerable degree of malleability subdiv 2 brittle metals arsenic bismuth antimony manganese tellurium cobalt tungsten molybdenum titanium chrome uranium columbium or tantalium iridium osmium rhodium footnote these last four or five metallic bodies are placed under this class for the sake of arrangement though some of their properties have not been yet fully investigated caroline oh what a formidable list you will have much to do to explain it mrs b for i assure you it is perfectly unintelligible to me and i think rather perplexes than assists me mrs b do not let that alarm you my dear i hope that hereafter this classification will appear quite clear and so far from perplexing you will assist you in arranging your ideas it would be in vain to attempt forming a division that would appear perfectly clear to a beginner for you may easily conceive that a chemical division being necessarily founded on properties with which you are almost wholly unacquainted it is impossible that you should at once be able to understand its meaning or appreciate its utility but before we proceed further it will be necessary to give you some idea of chemical attraction a power on which the whole science depends chemical attraction or the attraction of composition consists in the peculiar tendency which bodies of a different nature have to unite with each other it is by this force that all the compositions and decompositions are effected emily what is the difference between chemical attraction and the attraction of cohesion or of aggregation which you often mentioned to us in former conversations mrs b the attraction of cohesion exists only between particles of the same nature whether simple or compound thus it unites the particles of a piece of metal which is a simple substance and likewise the particles of a loaf of bread which is a compound the attraction of composition on the contrary unites and maintains in a state of combination particles of a dissimilar nature it is this power that forms each of the compound particles of which bread consists and it is by the attraction of cohesion that all these particles are connected into a single mass emily the attraction of cohesion then is the power which unites the integrant particles of a body the attraction of composition that which combines the constituent particles is it not so mrs b precisely and observe that the attraction of cohesion unites particles of a similar nature without changing their original properties the result of such an union therefore is a body of the same kind as the particles of which it is formed whilst the attraction of composition by combining particles of a dissimilar nature produces compound bodies quite different from any of their constituents if for instance i pour on the piece of copper contained in this glass some of this liquid which is called nitric acid for which it has a strong attraction every particle of the copper will combine with a particle of acid and together they will form a new body totally different from either the copper or the acid do you observe the internal commotion that already begins to take place it is produced by the combination of these two substances and yet the acid has in this case to overcome not only the resistance which the strong cohesion of the particles of copper opposes to their combination with it but also to overcome the weight of the copper which makes it sink to the bottom of the glass and prevents the acid from having such free access to it as it would if the metal were suspended in the liquid emily the acid seems however to overcome both these obstacles without difficulty and appears to be very rapidly dissolving the copper mrs b by this means it reduces the copper into more minute parts than could possibly be done by any mechanical power but as the acid can act only on the surface of the metal it will be some time before the union of these two bodies will be completed you may however already see how totally different this compound is from either of its ingredients it is neither colourless like the acid nor hard heavy and yellow like the copper if you tasted it you would no longer perceive the sourness of the acid it has at present the appearance of a blue liquid but when the union is completed and the water with which the acid is diluted is evaporated the compound will assume the form of regular crystals of a fine blue colour and perfectly transparent of these i can shew you a specimen as i have prepared some for that purpose footnote these crystals are more easily obtained from a mixture of sulphuric with a little nitric acid caroline how very beautiful they are in colour form and transparency emily nothing can be more striking than this example of chemical attraction mrs b the term attraction has been lately introduced into chemistry as a substitute for the word affinity to which some chemists have objected because it originated in the vague notion that chemical combinations depended upon a certain resemblance or relationship between particles that are disposed to unite and this idea is not only imperfect but erroneous as it is generally particles of the most dissimilar nature that have the greatest tendency to combine caroline besides there seems to be no advantage in using a variety of terms to express the same meaning on the contrary it creates confusion and as we are well acquainted with the term attraction in natural philosophy we had better adopt it in chemistry likewise mrs b if you have a clear idea of the meaning i shall leave you at liberty to express it in the terms you prefer for myself i confess that i think the word attraction best suited to the general law that unites the integrant particles of bodies and affinity better adapted to that which combines the constituent particles as it may convey an idea of the preference which some bodies have for others which the term attraction of composition does not so well express emily so i think for though that preference may not result from any relationship or similitude between the particles as you say was once supposed yet as it really exists it ought to be expressed mrs b well let it be agreed that you may use the terms affinity chemical attraction and attraction of composition indifferently provided you recollect that they have all the same meaning emily i do not conceive how bodies can be decomposed by chemical attraction that this power should be the means of composing them is very obvious but that it should at the same time produce exactly the contrary effect appears to me very singular mrs b to decompose a body is you know to separate its constituent parts which as we have just observed cannot be done by mechanical means emily no because mechanical means separate only the integrant particles they act merely against the attraction of cohesion and only divide a compound into smaller parts mrs b the decomposition of a body is performed by chemical powers if you present to a body composed of two principles a third which has a greater affinity for one of them than the two first have for each other it will be decomposed that is its two principles will be separated by means of the third body let us call two ingredients of which the body is composed a and b if we present to it another ingredient c which has a greater affinity for b than that which unites a and b it necessarily follows that b will quit a to combine with c the new ingredient therefore has effected a decomposition of the original body a b a has been left alone and a new compound b c has been formed emily we might i think use the comparison of two friends who were very happy in each others society till a third disunited them by the preference which one of them gave to the newcomer mrs b very well i shall now show you how this takes place in chemistry let us suppose that we wish to decompose the compound we have just formed by the combination of the two ingredients copper and nitric acid we may do this by presenting to it a piece of iron for which the acid has a stronger attraction than for copper the acid will consequently quit the copper to combine with the iron and the copper will be what the chemists call precipitated that is to say it will be thrown down in its separate state and reappear in its simple form in order to produce this effect i shall dip the blade of this knife into the fluid and when i take it out you will observe that instead of being wetted with a bluish liquid like that contained in the glass it will be covered with a thin coat of copper caroline so it is really but then is it not the copper instead of the acid that has combined with the iron blade mrs b no you are deceived by appearances it is the acid which combines with the iron and in so doing deposits or precipitates the copper on the surface of the blade emily but cannot three or more substances combine together without any of them being precipitated mrs b that is sometimes the case but in general the stronger affinity destroys the weaker and it seldom happens that the attraction of several substances for each other is so equally balanced as to produce such complicated compounds caroline but pray mrs b what is the cause of the chemical attraction of bodies for each other it appears to me more extraordinary or unnatural if i may use the expression than the attraction of cohesion which unites particles of a similar nature mrs b chemical attraction may like that of cohesion or gravitation be one of the powers inherent in matter which in our present state of knowledge admits of no other satisfactory explanation than an immediate reference to a divine cause sir h davy however whose important discoveries have opened such improved views in chemistry has suggested an hypothesis which may throw great light upon that science he supposes that there are two kinds of electricity with one or other of which all bodies are united these we distinguish by the names of positive and negative electricity those bodies are disposed to combine which possess opposite electricities as they are brought together by the attraction which these electricities have for each other but whether this hypothesis be altogether founded on truth or not it is impossible to question the great influence of electricity in chemical combinations emily so that we must suppose that the two electricities always attract each other and thus compel the bodies in which they exist to combine caroline and may not this be also the cause of the attraction of cohesion mrs b no for in particles of the same nature the same electricities must prevail and it is only the different or opposite electric fluids that attract each other caroline these electricities seem to me to be a kind of chemical spirit which animates the particles of bodies and draws them together emily if it is known then with which of the electricities bodies are united it can be inferred which will and which will not combine together mrs b certainly i should not omit to mention that some doubts have been entertained whether electricity be really a material agent or whether it might not be a power inherent in bodies similar to or perhaps identical with attraction emily but what then would be the electric spark which is visible and must therefore be really material mrs b what we call the electric spark may sir h davy says be merely the heat and light or fire produced by the chemical combinations with which these phenomena are always connected we will not however enter more fully on this important subject at present but reserve the principal facts which relate to it to a future conversation before we part however i must recommend you to fix in your memory the names of the simple bodies against our next interview conversation ii on light and heat or caloric caroline we have learned by heart the names of all the simple bodies which you have enumerated and we are now ready to enter on the examination of each of them successively you will begin i suppose with light mrs b respecting the nature of light we have little more than conjectures it is considered by most philosophers as a real substance immediately emanating from the sun and from all luminous bodies from which it is projected in right lines with prodigious velocity light however being imponderable it cannot be confined and examined by itself and therefore it is to the effects it produces on other bodies rather than to its immediate nature that we must direct our attention the connection between light and heat is very obvious indeed it is such that it is extremely difficult to examine the one independently of the other emily but is it possible to separate light from heat i thought they were only different degrees of the same thing fire mrs b i told you that fire was not now considered as a simple element whether light and heat be altogether different agents or not i cannot pretend to decide but in many cases light may be separated from heat the first discovery of this was made by a celebrated swedish chemist scheele another very striking illustration of the separation of heat and light was long after pointed out by dr herschell this philosopher discovered that these two agents were emitted in the rays of the sun and that heat was less refrangible than light for in separating the different coloured rays of light by a prism as we did some time ago he found that the greatest heat was beyond the spectrum at a little distance from the red rays which you may recollect are the least refrangible emily i should like to try that experiment mrs b it is by no means an easy one the heat of a ray of light refracted by a prism is so small that it requires a very delicate thermometer to distinguish the difference of the degree of heat within and without the spectrum for in this experiment the heat is not totally separated from the light each coloured ray retaining a certain portion of it though the greatest part is not sufficiently refracted to fall within the spectrum emily i suppose then that those coloured rays which are the least refrangible retain the greatest quantity of heat mrs b they do so emily though i no longer doubt that light and heat can be separated dr herschells experiment does not appear to me to afford sufficient proof that they are essentially different for light which you call a simple body may likewise be divided into the various coloured rays mrs b no doubt there must be some difference in the various coloured rays even their chemical powers are different the blue rays for instance have the greatest effect in separating oxygen from bodies as was found by scheele and there exist also as dr wollaston has shown rays more refrangible than the blue which produce the same chemical effect and what is very remarkable are invisible emily do you think it possible that heat may be merely a modification of light mrs b that is a supposition which in the present state of natural philosophy can neither be positively affirmed nor denied let us therefore instead of discussing theoretical points be contented with examining what is known respecting the chemical effects of light light is capable of entering into a kind of transitory union with certain substances and this is what has been called phosphorescence bodies that are possessed of this property after being exposed to the suns rays appear luminous in the dark the shells of fish the bones of land animals marble limestone and a variety of combinations of earths are more or less powerfully phosphorescent caroline i remember being much surprised last summer with the phosphorescent appearance of some pieces of rotten wood which had just been dug out of the ground they shone so bright that i at first supposed them to be glowworms emily and is not the light of a glowworm of a phosphorescent nature mrs b it is a very remarkable instance of phosphorescence in living animals this property however is not exclusively possessed by the glowworm the insect called the lanthornfly which is peculiar to warm climates emits light as it flies producing in the dark a remarkably sparkling appearance but it is more common to see animal matter in a dead state possessed of a phosphorescent quality sea fish is often eminently so emily i have heard that the sea has sometimes had the appearance of being illuminated and that the light is supposed to proceed from the spawn of fishes floating on its surface mrs b this light is probably owing to that or some other animal matter sea water has been observed to become luminous from the substance of a fresh herring having been immersed in it and certain insects of the medusa kind are known to produce similar effects but the strongest phosphorescence is produced by chemical compositions prepared for the purpose the most common of which consists of oyster shells and sulphur and is known by the name of cantons phosphorus emily i am rather surprised mrs b that you should have said so much of the light emitted by phosphorescent bodies without taking any notice of that which is produced by burning bodies mrs b the light emitted by the latter is so intimately connected with the chemical history of combustion that i must defer all explanation of it till we come to the examination of that process which is one of the most interesting in chemical science light is an agent capable of producing various chemical changes it is essential to the welfare both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms for men and plants grow pale and sickly if deprived of its salutary influence it is likewise remarkable for its property of destroying colour which renders it of great consequence in the process of bleaching emily is it not singular that light which in studying optics we were taught to consider as the source and origin of colours should have also the power of destroying them caroline it is a fact however that we every day experience you know how it fades the colours of linens and silks emily certainly and i recollect that endive is made to grow white instead of green by being covered up so as to exclude the light but by what means does light produce these effects mrs b this i cannot attempt to explain to you until you have obtained a further knowledge of chemistry as the chemical properties of light can be accounted for only in their reference to compound bodies it would be useless to detain you any longer on this subject we may therefore pass on to the examination of heat or caloric with which we are somewhat better acquainted heat and light may be always distinguished by the different sensations they produce light affects the sense of sight caloric that of feeling the one produces vision the other the sensation of heat caloric is found to exist in a variety of forms or modifications and i think it will be best to consider it under the two following heads viz 1 free or radiant caloric 2 combined caloric the first free or radiant caloric is also called heat of temperature it comprehends all heat which is perceptible to the senses and affects the thermometer emily you mean such as the heat of the sun of fire of candles of stoves in short of every thing that burns mrs b and likewise of things that do not burn as for instance the warmth of the body in a word all heat that is sensible whatever may be its degree or the source from which it is derived caroline what then are the other modifications of caloric it must be a strange kind of heat that cannot be perceived by our senses mrs b none of the modifications of caloric should properly be called heat for heat strictly speaking is the sensation produced by caloric on animated bodies this word therefore in the accurate language of science should be confined to express the sensation but custom has adapted it likewise to inanimate matter and we say the heat of an oven the heat of the sun without any reference to the sensation which they are capable of exciting it was in order to avoid the confusion which arose from thus confounding the cause and effect that modern chemists adopted the new word caloric to denote the principle which produces heat yet they do not always in compliance with their own language limit the word heat to the expression of the sensation since they still frequently employ it in reference to the other modifications of caloric which are quite independent of sensation caroline but you have not yet explained to us what these other modifications of caloric are mrs b because you are not acquainted with the properties of free caloric and you know that we have agreed to proceed with regularity one of the most remarkable properties of free caloric is its power of dilating bodies this fluid is so extremely subtle that it enters and pervades all bodies whatever forces itself between their particles and not only separates them but frequently drives them asunder to a considerable distance from each other it is thus that caloric dilates or expands a body so as to make it occupy a greater space than it did before emily the effect it has on bodies therefore is directly contrary to that of the attraction of cohesion the one draws the particles together the other drives them asunder mrs b precisely there is a continual struggle between the attraction of aggregation and the expansive power of caloric and from the action of these two opposite forces result all the various forms of matter or degrees of consistence from the solid to the liquid and ariform state and accordingly we find that most bodies are capable of passing from one of these forms to the other merely in consequence of their receiving different quantities of caloric caroline that is very curious but i think i understand the reason of it if a great quantity of caloric is added to a solid body it introduces itself between the particles in such a manner as to overcome in a considerable degree the attraction of cohesion and the body from a solid is then converted into a fluid mrs b this is the case whenever a body is fused or melted but if you add caloric to a liquid can you tell me what is the consequence caroline the caloric forces itself in greater abundance between the particles of the fluid and drives them to such a distance from each other that their attraction of aggregation is wholly destroyed the liquid is then transformed into vapour mrs b very well and this is precisely the case with boiling water when it is converted into steam or vapour and with all bodies that assume an ariform state emily i do not well understand the word ariform mrs b any elastic fluid whatever whether it be merely vapour or permanent air is called ariform but each of these various states solid liquid and ariform admit of many different degrees of density or consistence still arising chiefly at least from the different quantities of caloric the bodies contain solids are of various degrees of density from that of gold to that of a thin jelly liquids from the consistence of melted glue or melted metals to that of ether which is the lightest of all liquids the different elastic fluids with which you are not yet acquainted are susceptible of no less variety in their degrees of density emily but does not every individual body also admit of different degrees of consistence without changing its state mrs b undoubtedly and this i can immediately show you by a very simple experiment this piece of iron now exactly fits the frame or ring made to receive it but if heated red hot it will no longer do so for its dimensions will be so much increased by the caloric that has penetrated into it that it will be much too large for the frame the iron is now red hot by applying it to the frame we shall see how much it is dilated emily considerably so indeed i knew that heat had this effect on bodies but i did not imagine that it could be made so conspicuous mrs b by means of this instrument called a pyrometer we may estimate in the most exact manner the various dilatations of any solid body by heat the body we are now going to submit to trial is this small iron bar i fix it to this apparatus plate i fig 1 and then heat it by lighting the three lamps beneath it when the bar expands it increases in length as well as thickness and as one end communicates with this wheelwork whilst the other end is fixed and immoveable no sooner does it begin to dilate than it presses against the wheelwork and sets in motion the index which points out the degrees of dilatation on the dialplate illustration plate i vol i p 38 fig 1 pyrometer aa bar of metal 123 lamps burning bb wheel work c index fig 2 aa glass tubes with bulbs bb glasses of water in which they are immersed emily this is indeed a very curious instrument but i do not understand the use of the wheels would it not be more simple and answer the purpose equally well if the bar in dilating pressed against the index and put it in motion without the intervention of the wheels mrs b the use of the wheels is merely to multiply the motion and therefore render the effect of the caloric more obvious for if the index moved no more than the bar increased in length its motion would scarcely be perceptible but by means of the wheels it moves in a much greater proportion which therefore renders the variations far more conspicuous by submitting different bodies to the test of the pyrometer it is found that they are far from dilating in the same proportion different metals expand in different degrees and other kinds of solid bodies vary still more in this respect but this different susceptibility of dilatation is still more remarkable in fluids than in solid bodies as i shall show you i have here two glass tubes terminated at one end by large bulbs we shall fill the bulbs the one with spirit of wine the other with water i have coloured both liquids in order that the effect may be more conspicuous the spirit of wine you see dilates by the warmth of my hand as i hold the bulb emily it certainly does for i see it is rising into the tube but water it seems is not so easily affected by heat for scarcely any change is produced on it by the warmth of the hand mrs b true we shall now plunge the bulbs into hot water plate i fig 2 and you will see both liquids rise in the tubes but the spirit of wine will ascend highest caroline how rapidly it expands now it has nearly reached the top of the tube though the water has hardly begun to rise emily the water now begins to dilate are not these glass tubes with liquids rising within them very like thermometers mrs b a thermometer is constructed exactly on the same principle and these tubes require only a scale to answer the purpose of thermometers but they would be rather awkward in their dimensions the tubes and bulbs of thermometers though of various sizes are in general much smaller than these the tube too is hermetically closed and the air excluded from it the fluid most generally used in thermometers is mercury commonly called quicksilver the dilatations and contractions of which correspond more exactly to the additions and subtractions of caloric than those of any other fluid caroline yet i have often seen coloured spirit of wine used in thermometers mrs b the expansions and contractions of that liquid are not quite so uniform as those of mercury but in cases in which it is not requisite to ascertain the temperature with great precision spirit of wine will answer the purpose equally well and indeed in some respects better as the expansion of the latter is greater and therefore more conspicuous this fluid is used likewise in situations and experiments in which mercury would be frozen for mercury becomes a solid body like a piece of lead or any other metal at a certain degree of cold but no degree of cold has ever been known to freeze spirit of wine a thermometer therefore consists of a tube with a bulb such as you see here containing a fluid whose degrees of dilatation and contraction are indicated by a scale to which the tube is fixed the degree which indicates the boiling point simply means that when the fluid is sufficiently dilated to rise to this point the heat is such that water exposed to the same temperature will boil when on the other hand the fluid is so much condensed as to sink to the freezing point we know that water will freeze at that temperature the extreme points of the scales are not the same in all thermometers nor are the degrees always divided in the same manner in different countries philosophers have chosen to adopt different scales and divisions the two thermometers most used are those of fahrenheit and of reaumur the first is generally preferred by the english the latter by the french emily the variety of scale must be very inconvenient and i should think liable to occasion confusion when french and english experiments are compared mrs b the inconvenience is but very trifling because the different gradations of the scales do not affect the principle upon which thermometers are constructed when we know for instance that fahrenheits scale is divided into 212 degrees in which 32 corresponds with the freezing point and 212 with the point of boiling water and that reaumurs is divided only into 80 degrees in which 0 denotes the freezing point and 80 that of boiling water it is easy to compare the two scales together and reduce the one into the other but for greater convenience thermometers are sometimes constructed with both these scales one on either side of the tube so that the correspondence of the different degrees of the two scales is thus instantly seen here is one of these scales plate ii fig 1 by which you can at once perceive that each degree of reaumurs corresponds to 2 of fahrenheits division but i believe the french have of late given the preference to what they call the centigrade scale in which the space between the freezing and the boiling point is divided into 100 degrees illustration plate ii vol i p 42 fig 1 thermometer fahrenheits scale reaumurs scale boiling point of water freezing point of water fig 2 differential thermometer caroline that seems to me the most reasonable division and i cannot guess why the freezing point is called 32 or what advantage is derived from it mrs b there really is no advantage in it and it originated in a mistaken opinion of the instrumentmaker fahrenheit who first constructed these thermometers he mixed snow and salt together and produced by that means a degree of cold which he concluded was the greatest possible and therefore made his scale begin from that point between that and boiling water he made 212 degrees and the freezing point was found to be at 32 emily are spirit of wine and mercury the only liquids used in the construction of thermometers mrs b i believe they are the only liquids now in use though some others such as linseed oil would make tolerable thermometers but for experiments in which a very quick and delicate test of the changes of temperature is required air is the fluid sometimes employed the bulb of air thermometers is filled with common air only and its expansion and contraction are indicated by a small drop of any coloured liquor which is suspended within the tube and moves up and down according as the air within the bulb and tube expands or contracts but in general air thermometers however sensible to changes of temperature are by no means accurate in their indications i can however show you an air thermometer of a very peculiar construction which is remarkably well adapted for some chemical experiments as it is equally delicate and accurate in its indications caroline it looks like a double thermometer reversed the tube being bent and having a large bulb at each of its extremities plate ii fig 2 emily why do you call it an air thermometer the tube contains a coloured liquid mrs b but observe that the bulbs are filled with air the liquid being confined to a portion of the tube and answering only the purpose of showing by its motion in the tube the comparative dilatation or contraction of the air within the bulbs which afford an indication of their relative temperature thus if you heat the bulb a by the warmth of your hand the fluid will rise towards the bulb b and the contrary will happen if you reverse the experiment but if on the contrary both tubes are of the same temperature as is the case now the coloured liquid suffering an equal pressure on each side no change of level takes place caroline this instrument appears indeed uncommonly delicate the fluid is set in motion by the mere approach of my hand mrs b you must observe however that this thermometer cannot indicate the temperature of any particular body or of the medium in which it is immersed it serves only to point out the difference of temperature between the two bulbs when placed under different circumstances for this reason it has been called differential thermometer you will see byandbye to what particular purposes this instrument applies emily but do common thermometers indicate the exact quantity of caloric contained either in the atmosphere or in any body with which they are in contact mrs b no first because there are other modifications of caloric which do not affect the thermometer and secondly because the temperature of a body as indicated by the thermometer is only relative when for instance the thermometer remains stationary at the freezing point we know that the atmosphere or medium in which it is placed whatever it may be is as cold as freezing water and when it stands at the boiling point we know that this medium is as hot as boiling water but we do not know the positive quantity of heat contained either in freezing or boiling water any more than we know the real extremes of heat and cold and consequently we cannot determine that of the body in which the thermometer is placed caroline i do not quite understand this explanation mrs b let us compare a thermometer to a well in which the water rises to different heights according as it is more or less supplied by the spring which feeds it if the depth of the well is unfathomable it must be impossible to know the absolute quantity of water it contains yet we can with the greatest accuracy measure the number of feet the water has risen or fallen in the well at any time and consequently know the precise quantity of its increase or diminution without having the least knowledge of the whole quantity of water it contains caroline now i comprehend it very well nothing appears to me to explain a thing so clearly as a comparison emily but will thermometers bear any degree of heat mrs b no for if the temperature were much above the highest degree marked on the scale of the thermometer the mercury would burst the tube in an attempt to ascend and at any rate no thermometer can be applied to temperatures higher than the boiling point of the liquid used in its construction for the steam on the liquid beginning to boil would burst the tube in furnaces or whenever any very high temperature is to be measured a pyrometer invented by wedgwood is used for that purpose it is made of a certain composition of baked clay which has the peculiar property of contracting by heat so that the degree of contraction of this substance indicates the temperature to which it has been exposed emily but is it possible for a body to contract by heat i thought that heat dilated all bodies whatever mrs b this is not an exception to the rule you must recollect that the bulk of the clay is not compared whilst hot with that which it has when cold but it is from the change which the clay has undergone by having been heated that the indications of this instrument are derived this change consists in a beginning fusion which tends to unite the particles of clay more closely thus rendering it less pervious or spongy clay is to be considered as a spongy body having many interstices or pores from its having contained water when soft these interstices are by heat lessened and would by extreme heat be entirely obliterated caroline and how do you ascertain the degrees of contraction of wedgwoods pyrometer mrs b the dimensions of a piece of clay are measured by a scale graduated on the side of a tapered groove formed in a brass ruler the more the clay is contracted by the heat the further it will descend into the narrow part of the tube before we quit the subject of expansion i must observe to you that as liquids expand more readily than solids so elastic fluids whether air or vapour are the most expansible of all bodies it may appear extraordinary that all elastic fluids whatever undergo the same degree of expansion from equal augmentations of temperature emily i suppose then that all elastic fluids are of the same density mrs b very far from it they vary in density more than either liquids or solids the uniformity of their expansibility which at first may appear singular is however readily accounted for for if the different susceptibilities of expansion of bodies arise from their various degrees of attraction of cohesion no such difference can be expected in elastic fluids since in these the attraction of cohesion does not exist their particles being on the contrary possessed of an elastic or repulsive power they will therefore all be equally expanded by equal degrees of caloric emily true as there is no power opposed to the expansive force of caloric in elastic bodies its effect must be the same in all of them mrs b let us now proceed to examine the other properties of free caloric free caloric always tends to diffuse itself equally that is to say when two bodies are of different temperatures the warmer gradually parts with its heat to the colder till they are both brought to the same temperature thus when a thermometer is applied to a hot body it receives caloric when to a cold one it communicates part of its own caloric and this communication continues until the thermometer and the body arrive at the same temperature emily cold then is nothing but a negative quality simply implying the absence of heat mrs b not the total absence but a diminution of heat for we know of no body in which some caloric may not be discovered caroline but when i lay my hand on this marble table i feel it positively cold and cannot conceive that there is any caloric in it mrs b the cold you experience consists in the loss of caloric that your hand sustains in an attempt to bring its temperature to an equilibrium with the marble if you lay a piece of ice upon it you will find that the contrary effect will take place the ice will be melted by the heat which it abstracts from the marble caroline is it not in this case the air of the room which being warmer than the marble melts the ice mrs b the air certainly acts on the surface which is exposed to it but the table melts that part with which it is in contact caroline but why does caloric tend to an equilibrium it cannot be on the same principle as other fluids since it has no weight mrs b very true caroline that is an excellent objection you might also with some propriety object to the term equilibrium being applied to a body that is without weight but i know of no expression that would explain my meaning so well you must consider it however in a figurative rather than a literal sense its strict meaning is an equal diffusion we cannot indeed well say by what power it diffuses itself equally though it is not surprising that it should go from the parts which have the most to those which have the least this subject is best explained by a theory suggested by professor prevost of geneva which is now i believe generally adopted according to this theory caloric is composed of particles perfectly separate from each other every one of which moves with a rapid velocity in a certain direction these directions vary as much as imagination can conceive the result of which is that there are rays or lines of these particles moving with immense velocity in every possible direction caloric is thus universally diffused so that when any portion of space happens to be in the neighbourhood of another which contains more caloric the colder portion receives a quantity of calorific rays from the latter sufficient to restore an equilibrium of temperature this radiation does not only take place in free space but extends also to bodies of every kind thus you may suppose all bodies whatever constantly radiating caloric those that are of the same temperature give out and absorb equal quantities so that no variation of temperature is produced in them but when one body contains more free caloric than another the exchange is always in favour of the colder body until an equilibrium is effected this you found to be the case when the marble table cooled your hand and again when it melted the ice caroline this reciprocal radiation surprises me extremely i thought from what you first said that the hotter bodies alone emitted rays of caloric which were absorbed by the colder for it seems unnatural that a hot body should receive any caloric from a cold one even though it should return a greater quantity mrs b it may at first appear so but it is no more extraordinary than that a candle should send forth rays of light to the sun which you know must necessarily happen caroline well mrs b i believe that i must give up the point but i wish i could see these rays of caloric i should then have greater faith in them mrs b will you give no credit to any sense but that of sight you may feel the rays of caloric which you receive from any body of a temperature higher than your own the loss of the caloric you part with in return it is true is not perceptible for as you gain more than you lose instead of suffering a diminution you are really making an acquisition of caloric it is therefore only when you are parting with it to a body of a lower temperature that you are sensible of the sensation of cold because you then sustain an absolute loss of caloric emily and in this case we cannot be sensible of the small quantity of heat we receive in exchange from the colder body because it serves only to diminish the loss mrs b very well indeed emily professor pictet of geneva has made some very interesting experiments which prove not only that caloric radiates from all bodies whatever but that these rays may be reflected according to the laws of optics in the same manner as light i shall repeat these experiments before you having procured mirrors fit for the purpose and it will afford us an opportunity of using the differential thermometer which is particularly well adapted for these experiments i place an iron bullet plate iii fig 1 about two inches in diameter and heated to a degree not sufficient to render it luminous in the focus of this large metallic concave mirror the rays of heat which fall on this mirror are reflected agreeably to the property of concave mirrors in a parallel direction so as to fall on a similar mirror which you see is placed opposite to the first at the distance of about ten feet thence the rays converge to the focus of the second mirror in which i place one of the bulbs of this thermometer now observe in what manner it is affected by the caloric which is reflected on it from the heated bullet the air is dilated in the bulb which we placed in the focus of the mirror and the liquor rises considerably in the opposite leg illustration plate iii vol i p 54 mr pictets apparatus for the reflection of heat fig 1 aa bb concave mirrors fixed on stands c heated bullet placed in the focus of the mirror a d thermometer with its bulb placed in the focus of the mirror b 1234 rays of caloric radiating from the bullet falling on the mirror a 5678 the same rays reflected from the mirror a to the mirror b 9101112 the same rays reflected by the mirror b to the thermometer emily but would not the same effect take place if the rays of caloric from the heated bullet fell directly on the thermometer without the assistance of the mirrors mrs b the effect would in that case be so trifling at the distance at which the bullet and the thermometer are from each other that it would be almost imperceptible the mirrors you know greatly increase the effect by collecting a large quantity of rays into a focus place your hand in the focus of the mirror and you will find it much hotter there than when you remove it nearer to the bullet emily that is very true it appears extremely singular to feel the heat diminish in approaching the body from which it proceeds caroline and the mirror which produces so much heat by converging the rays is itself quite cold mrs b the same number of rays that are dispersed over the surface of the mirror are collected by it into the focus but if you consider how large a surface the mirror presents to the rays and consequently how much they are diffused in comparison to what they are at the focus which is little more than a point i think you can no longer wonder that the focus should be so much hotter than the mirror the principal use of the mirrors in this experiment is to prove that the calorific emanation is reflected in the same manner as light caroline and the result i think is very conclusive mrs b the experiment may be repeated with a wax taper instead of the bullet with a view of separating the light from the caloric for this purpose a transparent plate of glass must be interposed between the mirrors for light you know passes with great facility through glass whilst the transmission of caloric is almost wholly impeded by it we shall find however in this experiment that some few of the calorific rays pass through the glass together with the light as the thermometer rises a little but as soon as the glass is removed and a free passage left to the caloric it will rise considerably higher emily this experiment as well as that of dr herschells proves that light and heat may be separated for in the latter experiment the separation was not perfect any more than in that of mr pictet caroline i should like to repeat this experiment with the difference of substituting a cold body instead of the hot one to see whether cold would not be reflected as well as heat mrs b that experiment was proposed to mr pictet by an incredulous philosopher like yourself and he immediately tried it by substituting a piece of ice in the place of the heated bullet caroline well mrs b and what was the result mrs b that we shall see i have procured some ice for the purpose emily the thermometer falls considerably caroline and does not that prove that cold is not merely a negative quality implying simply an inferior degree of heat the cold must be positive since it is capable of reflection mrs b so it at first appeared to mr pictet but upon a little consideration he found that it afforded only an additional proof of the reflection of heat this i shall endeavour to explain to you according to mr prevosts theory we suppose that all bodies whatever radiate caloric the thermometer used in these experiments therefore emits calorific rays in the same manner as any other substance when its temperature is in equilibrium with that of the surrounding bodies it receives as much caloric as it parts with and no change of temperature is produced but when we introduce a body of a lower temperature such as a piece of ice which parts with less caloric than it receives the consequence is that its temperature is raised whilst that of the surrounding bodies is proportionally lowered emily if for instance i was to bring a large piece of ice into this room the ice would in time be melted by absorbing caloric from the general radiation which is going on throughout the room and as it would contribute very little caloric in return for what is absorbed the room would necessarily be cooled by it mrs b just so and as in consequence of the mirrors a more considerable exchange of rays takes place between the ice and the thermometer than between these and any of the surrounding bodies the temperature of the thermometer must be more lowered than that of any other adjacent object caroline i confess i do not perfectly understand your explanation mrs b this experiment is exactly similar to that made with the heated bullet for if we consider the thermometer as the hot body which it certainly is in comparison to the ice you may then easily understand that it is by the loss of the calorific rays which the thermometer sends to the ice and not by any cold rays received from it that the fall of the mercury is occasioned for the ice far from emitting rays of cold sends forth rays of caloric which diminish the loss sustained by the thermometer let us say for instance that the radiation of the thermometer towards the ice is equal to 20 and that of the ice towards the thermometer to 10 the exchange in favour of the ice is as 20 is to 10 or the thermometer absolutely loses 10 whilst the ice gains 10 caroline but if the ice actually sends rays of caloric to the thermometer must not the latter fall still lower when the ice is removed mrs b no for the space that the ice occupied admits rays from all the surrounding bodies to pass through it and those being of the same temperature as the thermometer will not affect it because as much heat now returns to the thermometer as radiates from it caroline i must confess that you have explained this in so satisfactory a manner that i cannot help being convinced now that cold has no real claim to the rank of a positive being mrs b before i conclude the subject of radiation i must observe to you that different bodies or rather surfaces possess the power of radiating caloric in very different degrees some very curious experiments have been made by mr leslie on this subject and it was for this purpose that he invented the differential thermometer with its assistance he ascertained that black surfaces radiate most glass next and polished surfaces the least of all emily supposing these surfaces of course to be all of the same temperature mrs b undoubtedly i will now show you the very simple and ingenious apparatus by means of which he made these experiments this cubical tin vessel or canister has each of its sides externally covered with different materials the one is simply blackened the next is covered with white paper the third with a pane of glass and in the fourth the polished tin surface remains uncovered we shall fill this vessel with hot water so that there can be no doubt but that all its sides will be of the same temperature now let us place it in the focus of one of the mirrors making each of its sides front it in succession we shall begin with the black surface caroline it makes the thermometer which is in the focus of the other mirror rise considerably let us turn the paper surface towards the mirror the thermometer falls a little therefore of course this side cannot emit or radiate so much caloric as the blackened side emily this is very surprising for the sides are exactly of the same size and must be of the same temperature but let us try the glass surface mrs b the thermometer continues falling and with the plain surface it falls still lower these two surfaces therefore radiate less and less caroline i think i have found out the reason of this mrs b i should be very happy to hear it for it has not yet to my knowledge been accounted for caroline the water within the vessel gradually cools and the thermometer in consequence gradually falls mrs b it is true that the water cools but certainly in much less proportion than the thermometer descends as you will perceive if you now change the tin surface for the black one caroline i was mistaken certainly for the thermometer rises again now that the black surface fronts the mirror mrs b and yet the water in the vessel is still cooling caroline emily i am surprised that the tin surface should radiate the least caloric for a metallic vessel filled with hot water a silver teapot for instance feels much hotter to the hand than one of black earthen ware mrs b that is owing to the different power which various bodies possess for conducting caloric a property which we shall presently examine thus although a metallic vessel feels warmer to the hand a vessel of this kind is known to preserve the heat of the liquid within better than one of any other materials it is for this reason that silver teapots make better tea than those of earthen ware emily according to these experiments lightcoloured dresses in cold weather should keep us warmer than black clothes since the latter radiate so much more than the former mrs b and that is actually the case emily this property of different surfaces to radiate in different degrees appears to me to be at variance with the equilibrium of caloric since it would imply that those bodies which radiate most must ultimately become coldest suppose that we were to vary this experiment by using two metallic vessels full of boiling water the one blackened the other not would not the black one cool the first caroline true but when they were both brought down to the temperature of the room the interchange of caloric between the canisters and the other bodies of the room being then equal their temperatures would remain the same emily i do not see why that should be the case for if different surfaces of the same temperature radiate in different degrees when heated why should they not continue to do so when cooled down to the temperature of the room mrs b you have started a difficulty emily which certainly requires explanation it is found by experiment that the power of absorption corresponds with and is proportional to that of radiation so that under equal temperatures bodies compensate for the greater loss they sustain in consequence of their greater radiation by their greater absorption so that if you were to make your experiment in an atmosphere heated like the canisters to the temperature of boiling water though it is true that the canisters would radiate in different degrees no change of temperature would be produced in them because they would each absorb caloric in proportion to their respective radiation emily but would not the canisters of boiling water also absorb caloric in different degrees in a room of the common temperature mrs b undoubtedly they would but the various bodies in the room would not at a lower temperature furnish either of the canisters with a sufficiency of caloric to compensate for the loss they undergo for suppose the black canister to absorb 400 rays of caloric whilst the metallic one absorbed only 200 yet if the former radiate 800 whilst the latter radiates only 400 the black canister will be the first cooled down to the temperature of the room but from the moment the equilibrium of temperature has taken place the black canister both receiving and giving out 400 rays and the metallic one 200 no change of temperature will take place emily i now understand it extremely well but what becomes of the surplus of calorific rays which good radiators emit and bad radiators refuse to receive they must wander about in search of a restingplace mrs b they really do so for they are rejected and sent back or in other words reflected by the bodies which are bad radiators of caloric and they are thus transmitted to other bodies which happen to lie in their way by which they are either absorbed or again reflected according as the property of reflection or that of absorption predominates in these bodies caroline i do not well understand the difference between radiating and reflecting caloric for the caloric that is reflected from a body proceeds from it in straight lines and may surely be said to radiate from it mrs b it is true that there at first appears to be a great analogy between radiation and reflection as they equally convey the idea of the transmission of caloric but if you consider a little you will perceive that when a body radiates caloric the heat which it emits not only proceeds from but has its origin in the body itself whilst when a body reflects caloric it parts with none of its own caloric but only reflects that which it receives from other bodies emily of this difference we have very striking examples before us in the tin vessel of water and the concave mirrors the first radiates its own heat the latter reflect the heat which they receive from other bodies caroline now that i understand the difference it no longer surprises me that bodies which radiate or part with their own caloric freely should not have the power of transmitting with equal facility that which they receive from other bodies emily yet no body can be said to possess caloric of its own if all caloric is originally derived from the sun mrs b when i speak of a body radiating its own caloric i mean that which it has absorbed and incorporated either immediately from the suns rays or through the medium of any other substance caroline it seems natural enough that the power of absorption should be in opposition to that of reflection for the more caloric a body receives the less it will reject emily and equally so that the power of radiation should correspond with that of absorption it is in fact cause and effect for a body cannot radiate heat without having previously absorbed it just as a spring that is well fed flows abundantly mrs b fluids are in general very bad radiators of caloric and air neither radiates nor absorbs caloric in any sensible degree we have not yet concluded our observations on free caloric but i shall defer till our next meeting what i have further to say on this subject i believe it will afford us ample conversation for another interview conversation iii continuation of the subject mrs b in our last conversation we began to examine the tendency of caloric to restore an equilibrium of temperature this property when once well understood affords the explanation of a great variety of facts which appeared formerly unaccountable you must observe in the first place that the effect of this tendency is gradually to bring all bodies that are in contact to the same temperature thus the fire which burns in the grate communicates its heat from one object to another till every part of the room has an equal proportion of it emily and yet this book is not so cold as the table on which it lies though both are at an equal distance from the fire and actually in contact with each other so that according to your theory they should be exactly of the same temperature caroline and the hearth which is much nearer the fire than the carpet is certainly the colder of the two mrs b if you ascertain the temperature of these several bodies by a thermometer which is a much more accurate test than your feeling you will find that it is exactly the same caroline but if they are of the same temperature why should the one feel colder than the other mrs b the hearth and the table feel colder than the carpet or the book because the latter are not such good conductors of heat as the former caloric finds a more easy passage through marble and wood than through leather and worsted the two former will therefore absorb heat more rapidly from your hand and consequently give it a stronger sensation of cold than the two latter although they are all of them really of the same temperature caroline so then the sensation i feel on touching a cold body is in proportion to the rapidity with which my hand yields its heat to that body mrs b precisely and if you lay your hand successively on every object in the room you will discover which are good and which are bad conductors of heat by the different degrees of cold you feel but in order to ascertain this point it is necessary that the several substances should be of the same temperature which will not be the case with those that are very near the fire or those that are exposed to a current of cold air from a window or door emily but what is the reason that some bodies are better conductors of heat than others mrs b this is a point not well ascertained it has been conjectured that a certain union or adherence takes place between the caloric and the particles of the body through which it passes if this adherence be strong the body detains the heat and parts with it slowly and reluctantly if slight it propagates it freely and rapidly the conducting power of a body is therefore inversely as its tendency to unite with caloric emily that is to say that the best conductors are those that have the least affinity for caloric mrs b yes but the term affinity is objectionable in this case because as that word is used to express a chemical attraction which can be destroyed only by decomposition it cannot be applicable to the slight and transient union that takes place between free caloric and the bodies through which it passes an union which is so weak that it constantly yields to the tendency which caloric has to an equilibrium now you clearly understand that the passage of caloric through bodies that are good conductors is much more rapid than through those that are bad conductors and that the former both give and receive it more quickly and therefore in a given time more abundantly than bad conductors which makes them feel either hotter or colder though they may be in fact both of the same temperature caroline yes i understand it now the table and the book lying upon it being really of the same temperature would each receive in the same space of time the same quantity of heat from my hand were their conducting powers equal but as the table is the best conductor of the two it will absorb the heat from my hand more rapidly and consequently produce a stronger sensation of cold than the book mrs b very well my dear and observe likewise that if you were to heat the table and the book an equal number of degrees above the temperature of your body the table which before felt the colder would now feel the hotter of the two for as in the first case it took the heat most rapidly from your hand so it will now impart heat most rapidly to it thus the marble table which seems to us colder than the mahogany one will prove the hotter of the two to the ice for if it takes heat more rapidly from our hands which are warmer it will give out heat more rapidly to the ice which is colder do you understand the reason of these apparently opposite effects emily perfectly a body which is a good conductor of caloric affords it a free passage so that it penetrates through that body more rapidly than through one which is a bad conductor and consequently if it is colder than your hand you lose more caloric and if it is hotter you gain more than with a bad conductor of the same temperature mrs b but you must observe that this is the case only when the conductors are either hotter or colder than your hand for if you heat different conductors to the temperature of your body they will all feel equally warm since the exchange of caloric between bodies of the same temperature is equal now can you tell me why flannel clothing which is a very bad conductor of heat prevents our feeling cold caroline it prevents the cold from penetrating mrs b but you forget that cold is only a negative quality caroline true it only prevents the heat of our bodies from escaping so rapidly as it would otherwise do mrs b now you have explained it right the flannel rather keeps in the heat than keeps out the cold were the atmosphere of a higher temperature than our bodies it would be equally efficacious in keeping their temperature at the same degree as it would prevent the free access of the external heat by the difficulty with which it conducts it emily this i think is very clear heat whether external or internal cannot easily penetrate flannel therefore in cold weather it keeps us warm and if the weather was hotter than our bodies it would keep us cool mrs b the most dense bodies are generally speaking the best conductors of heat probably because the denser the body the greater are the number of points or particles that come in contact with caloric at the common temperature of the atmosphere a piece of metal will feel much colder than a piece of wood and the latter than a piece of woollen cloth this again will feel colder than flannel and down which is one of the lightest is at the same time one of the warmest bodies caroline this is i suppose the reason that the plumage of birds preserves them so effectually from the influence of cold in winter mrs b yes but though feathers in general are an excellent preservative against cold down is a kind of plumage peculiar to aquatic birds and covers their chest which is the part most exposed to the water for though the surface of the water is not of a lower temperature than the atmosphere yet as it is a better conductor of heat it feels much colder consequently the chest of the bird requires a warmer covering than any other part of its body besides the breasts of aquatic birds are exposed to cold not only from the temperature of the water but also from the velocity with which the breast of the bird strikes against it and likewise from the rapid evaporation occasioned in that part by the air against which it strikes after it has been moistened by dipping from time to time into the water if you hold a finger of one hand motionless in a glass of water and at the same time move a finger of the other hand swiftly through water of the same temperature a different sensation will be soon perceived in the different fingers most animal substances especially those which providence has assigned as a covering for animals such as fur wool hair skin c are bad conductors of heat and are on that account such excellent preservatives against the inclemency of winter that our warmest apparel is made of these materials emily wood is i dare say not so good a conductor as metal and it is for that reason no doubt that silver teapots have always wooden handles mrs b yes and it is the facility with which metals conduct caloric that made you suppose that a silver pot radiated more caloric than an earthen one the silver pot is in fact hotter to the hand when in contact with it but it is because its conducting power more than counterbalances its deficiency in regard to radiation we have observed that the most dense bodies are in general the best conductors and metals you know are of that class porous bodies such as the earths and wood are worse conductors chiefly i believe on account of their pores being filled with air for air is a remarkably bad conductor caroline it is a very fortunate circumstance that air should be a bad conductor as it tends to preserve the heat of the body when exposed to cold weather mrs b it is one of the many benevolent dispensations of providence in order to soften the inclemency of the seasons and to render almost all climates habitable to man in fluids of different densities the power of conducting heat varies no less remarkably if you dip your hand into this vessel full of mercury you will scarcely conceive that its temperature is not lower than that of the atmosphere caroline indeed i know not how to believe it it feels so extremely cold but we may easily ascertain its true temperature by the thermometer it is really not colder than the airthe apparent difference then is produced merely by the difference of the conducting power in mercury and in air mrs b yes hence you may judge how little the sense of feeling is to be relied on as a test of the temperature of bodies and how necessary a thermometer is for that purpose it has indeed been doubted whether fluids have the power of conducting caloric in the same manner as solid bodies count rumford a very few years since attempted to prove by a variety of experiments that fluids when at rest were not at all endowed with this property caroline how is that possible since they are capable of imparting cold or heat to us for if they did not conduct heat they would neither take it from nor give it to us mrs b count rumford did not mean to say that fluids would not communicate their heat to solid bodies but only that heat does not pervade fluids that is to say is not transmitted from one particle of a fluid to another in the same manner as in solid bodies emily but when you heat a vessel of water over the fire if the particles of water do not communicate heat to each other how does the water become hot throughout mrs b by constant agitation water as you have seen expands by heat in the same manner as solid bodies the heated particles of water therefore at the bottom of the vessel become specifically lighter than the rest of the liquid and consequently ascend to the surface where parting with some of their heat to the colder atmosphere they are condensed and give way to a fresh succession of heated particles ascending from the bottom which having thrown off their heat at the surface are in their turn displaced thus every particle is successively heated at the bottom and cooled at the surface of the liquid but as the fire communicates heat more rapidly than the atmosphere cools the succession of surfaces the whole of the liquid in time becomes heated caroline this accounts most ingeniously for the propagation of heat upwards but suppose you were to heat the upper surface of a liquid the particles being specifically lighter than those below could not descend how therefore would the heat be communicated downwards mrs b if there were no agitation to force the heated surface downwards count rumford assures us that the heat would not descend in proof of this he succeeded in making the upper surface of a vessel of water boil and evaporate while a cake of ice remained frozen at the bottom caroline that is very extraordinary indeed mrs b it appears so because we are not accustomed to heat liquids by their upper surface but you will understand this theory better if i show you the internal motion that takes place in liquids when they experience a change of temperature the motion of the liquid itself is indeed invisible from the extreme minuteness of its particles but if you mix with it any coloured dust or powder of nearly the same specific gravity as the liquid you may judge of the internal motion of the latter by that of the coloured dust it contains do you see the small pieces of amber moving about in the liquid contained in this phial caroline yes perfectly mrs b we shall now immerse the phial in a glass of hot water and the motion of the liquid will be shown by that which it communicates to the amber emily i see two currents the one rising along the sides of the phial the other descending in the centre but i do not understand the reason of this mrs b the hot water communicates its caloric through the medium of the phial to the particles of the fluid nearest to the glass these dilate and ascend laterally to the surface where in parting with their heat they are condensed and in descending form the central current caroline this is indeed a very clear and satisfactory experiment but how much slower the currents now move than they did at first mrs b it is because the circulation of particles has nearly produced an equilibrium of temperature between the liquid in the glass and that in the phial caroline but these communicate laterally and i thought that heat in liquids could be propagated only upwards mrs b you do not take notice that the heat is imparted from one liquid to the other through the medium of the phial itself the external surface of which receives the heat from the water in the glass whilst its internal surface transmits it to the liquid it contains now take the phial out of the hot water and observe the effect of its cooling emily the currents are reversed the external current now descends and the internal one rises i guess the reason of this change the phial being in contact with cold air instead of hot water the external particles are cooled instead of being heated they therefore descend and force up the central particles which being warmer are consequently lighter mrs b it is just so count rumford hence infers that no alteration of temperature can take place in a fluid without an internal motion of its particles and as this motion is produced only by the comparative levity of the heated particles heat cannot be propagated downwards but though i believe that count rumfords theory as to heat being incapable of pervading fluids is not strictly correct yet there is no doubt much truth in his observation that the communication is materially promoted by a motion of the parts and this accounts for the cold that is found to prevail at the bottom of the lakes in switzerland which are fed by rivers issuing from the snowy alps the water of these rivers being colder and therefore more dense than that of the lakes subsides to the bottom where it cannot be affected by the warmer temperature of the surface the motion of the waves may communicate this temperature to some little depth but it can descend no further than the agitation extends emily but when the atmosphere is colder than the lake the colder surface of the water will descend for the very reason that the warmer will not mrs b certainly and it is on this account that neither a lake nor any body of water whatever can be frozen until every particle of the water has risen to the surface to give off its caloric to the colder atmosphere therefore the deeper a body of water is the longer will be the time it requires to be frozen emily but if the temperature of the whole body of water be brought down to the freezing point why is only the surface frozen mrs b the temperature of the whole body is lowered but not to the freezing point the diminution of heat as you know produces a contraction in the bulk of fluids as well as of solids this effect however does not take place in water below the temperature of 40 degrees which is 8 degrees above the freezing point at that temperature therefore the internal motion occasioned by the increased specific gravity of the condensed particles ceases for when the water at the surface no longer condenses it will no longer descend and leave a fresh surface exposed to the atmosphere this surface alone therefore will be further exposed to its severity and will soon be brought down to the freezing point when it becomes ice which being a bad conductor of heat preserves the water beneath a long time from being affected by the external cold caroline and the sea does not freeze i suppose because its depth is so great that a frost never lasts long enough to bring down the temperature of such a great body of water to 40 degrees mrs b that is one reason why the sea as a large mass of water does not freeze but independently of this salt water does not freeze till it is cooled much below 32 degrees and with respect to the law of condensation salt water is an exception as it condenses even many degrees below the freezing point when the caloric of fresh water therefore is imprisoned by the ice on its surface the ocean still continues throwing off heat into the atmosphere which is a most signal dispensation of providence to moderate the intensity of the cold in winter caroline this theory of the nonconducting power of liquids does not i suppose hold good with respect to air otherwise the atmosphere would not be heated by the rays of the sun passing through it mrs b nor is it heated in that way the pure atmosphere is a perfectly transparent medium which neither radiates absorbs nor conducts caloric but transmits the rays of the sun to us without in any way diminishing their intensity the air is therefore not more heated by the suns rays passing through it than diamond glass water or any other transparent medium caroline that is very extraordinary are glass windows not heated then by the sun shining on them mrs b no not if the glass be perfectly transparent a most convincing proof that glass transmits the rays of the sun without being heated by them is afforded by the burning lens which by converging the rays to a focus will set combustible bodies on fire without its own temperature being raised emily yet mrs b if i hold a piece of glass near the fire it is almost immediately warmed by it the glass therefore must retain some of the caloric radiated by the fire is it that the solar rays alone pass freely through glass without paying tribute it seems unaccountable that the radiation of a common fire should have power to do what the suns rays cannot accomplish mrs b it is not because the rays from the fire have more power but rather because they have less that they heat glass and other transparent bodies it is true however that as you approach the source of heat the rays being nearer each other the heat is more condensed and can produce effects of which the solar rays from the great distance of their source are incapable thus we should find it impossible to roast a joint of meat by the suns rays though it is so easily done by culinary heat yet caloric emanated from burning bodies which is commonly called culinary heat has neither the intensity nor the velocity of solar rays all caloric we have said is supposed to proceed originally from the sun but after having been incorporated with terrestrial bodies and again given out by them though its nature is not essentially altered it retains neither the intensity nor the velocity with which it first emanated from that luminary it has therefore not the power of passing through transparent mediums such as glass and water without being partially retained by those bodies emily i recollect that in the experiment on the reflection of heat the glass skreen which you interposed between the burning taper and the mirror arrested the rays of caloric and suffered only those of light to pass through it caroline glass windows then though they cannot be heated by the sun shining on them may be heated internally by a fire in the room but mrs b since the atmosphere is not warmed by the solar rays passing through it how does it obtain heat for all the fires that are burning on the surface of the earth would contribute very little towards warming it emily the radiation of heat is not confined to burning bodies for all bodies you know have that property therefore not only every thing upon the surface of the earth but the earth itself must radiate heat and this terrestrial caloric not having i suppose sufficient power to traverse the atmosphere communicates heat to it mrs b your inference is extremely well drawn emily but the foundation on which it rests is not sound for the fact is that terrestrial or culinary heat though it cannot pass through the denser transparent mediums such as glass or water without loss traverses the atmosphere completely so that all the heat which the earth radiates unless it meet with clouds or any foreign body to intercept its passage passes into the distant regions of the universe caroline what a pity that so much heat should be wasted mrs b before you are tempted to object to any law of nature reflect whether it may not prove to be one of the numberless dispensations of providence for our good if all the heat which the earth has received from the sun since the creation had been accumulated in it its temperature by this time would no doubt have been more elevated than any human being could have borne caroline i spoke indeed very inconsiderately but mrs b though the earth at such a high temperature might have scorched our feet we should always have had a cool refreshing air to breathe since the radiation of the earth does not heat the atmosphere emily the cool air would have afforded but very insufficient refreshment whilst our bodies were exposed to the burning radiation of the earth mrs b nor should we have breathed a cool air for though it is true that heat is not communicated to the atmosphere by radiation yet the air is warmed by contact with heated bodies in the same manner as solids or liquids the stratum of air which is immediately in contact with the earth is heated by it it becomes specifically lighter and rises making way for another stratum of air which is in its turn heated and carried upwards and thus each successive stratum of air is warmed by coming in contact with the earth you may perceive this effect in a sultry day if you attentively observe the strata of air near the surface of the earth they appear in constant agitation for though it is true the air is itself invisible yet the sun shining on the vapours floating in it render them visible like the amber dust in the water the temperature of the surface of the earth is therefore the source from whence the atmosphere derives its heat though it is communicated neither by radiation nor transmitted from one particle of it to another by the conducting power but every particle of air must come in contact with the earth in order to receive heat from it emily wind then by agitating the air should contribute to cool the earth and warm the atmosphere by bringing a more rapid succession of fresh strata of air in contact with the earth and yet in general wind feels cooler than still air mrs b because the agitation of the air carries off heat from the surface of our bodies more rapidly than still air by occasioning a greater number of points of contact in a given time emily since it is from the earth and not the sun that the atmosphere receives its heat i no longer wonder that elevated regions should be colder than plains and valleys it was always a subject of astonishment to me that in ascending a mountain and approaching the sun the air became colder instead of being more heated mrs b at the distance of about a hundred million of miles which we are from the sun the approach of a few thousand feet makes no sensible difference whilst it produces a very considerable effect with regard to the warming the atmosphere at the surface of the earth caroline yet as the warm air rises from the earth and the cold air descends to it i should have supposed that heat would have accumulated in the upper regions of the atmosphere and that we should have felt the air warmer as we ascended mrs b the atmosphere you know diminishes in density and consequently in weight as it is more distant from the earth the warm air therefore rises only till it meets with a stratum of air of its own density and it will not ascend into the upper regions of the atmosphere until all the parts beneath have been previously heated the length of summer even in warm climates does not heat the air sufficiently to melt the snow which has accumulated during the winter on very high mountains although they are almost constantly exposed to the heat of the suns rays being too much elevated to be often enveloped in clouds emily these explanations are very satisfactory but allow me to ask you one more question respecting the increased levity of heated liquids you said that when water was heated over the fire the particles at the bottom of the vessel ascended as soon as heated in consequence of their specific levity why does not the same effect continue when the water boils and is converted into steam and why does the steam rise from the surface instead of the bottom of the liquid mrs b the steam or vapour does ascend from the bottom though it seems to arise from the surface of the liquid we shall boil some water in this florence flask plate iv fig 1 in order that you may be well acquainted with the process of ebullitionyou will then see through the glass that the vapour rises in bubbles from the bottom we shall make it boil by means of a lamp which is more convenient for this purpose than the chimney fire illustration plate iv vol i p 84 fig 1 pneumatic pump ether evaporated water frozen in the air pump a phial of ether b glass vessel containing water cc thermometers one in the ether the other in the water fig 2 boiling water in a flask over a patent lamp emily i see some small bubbles ascend and a great many appear all over the inside of the flask does the water begin to boil already mrs b no what you now see are bubbles of air which were either dissolved in the water or attached to the inner surface of the flask and which being rarefied by the heat ascend in the water emily but the heat which rarefies the air inclosed in the water must rarefy the water at the same time therefore if it could remain stationary in the water when both were cold i do not understand why it should not when both are equally heated mrs b air being much less dense than water is more easily rarefied the former therefore expands to a great extent whilst the latter continues to occupy nearly the same space for water dilates comparatively but very little without changing its state and becoming vapour now that the water in the flask begins to boil observe what large bubbles rise from the bottom of it emily i see them perfectly but i wonder that they have sufficient power to force themselves through the water caroline they must rise you know from their specific levity mrs b you are right caroline but vapour has not in all liquids when brought to the degree of vaporization the power of overcoming the pressure of the less heated surface metals for instance mercury excepted evaporate only from the surface therefore no vapour will ascend from them till the degree of heat which is necessary to form it has reached the surface that is to say till the whole of the liquid is brought to a state of ebullition emily i have observed that steam immediately issuing from the spout of a teakettle is less visible than at a further distance from it yet it must be more dense when it first evaporates than when it begins to diffuse itself in the air mrs b when the steam is first formed it is so perfectly dissolved by caloric as to be invisible in order however to understand this it will be necessary for me to enter into some explanation respecting the nature of solution solution takes place whenever a body is melted in a fluid in this operation the body is reduced to such a minute state of division by the fluid as to become invisible in it and to partake of its fluidity but in common solutions this happens without any decomposition the body being only divided into its integrant particles by the fluid in which it is melted caroline it is then a mode of destroying the attraction of aggregation mrs b undoubtedly the two principal solvent fluids are water and caloric you may have observed that if you melt salt in water it totally disappears and the water remains clear and transparent as before yet though the union of these two bodies appears so perfect it is not produced by any chemical combination both the salt and the water remain unchanged and if you were to separate them by evaporating the latter you would find the salt in the same state as before emily i suppose that water is a solvent for solid bodies and caloric for liquids mrs b liquids of course can only be converted into vapour by caloric but the solvent power of this agent is not at all confined to that class of bodies a great variety of solid substances are dissolved by heat thus metals which are insoluble in water can be dissolved by intense heat being first fused or converted into a liquid and then rarefied into an invisible vapour many other bodies such as salt gums c yield to either of these solvents caroline and that no doubt is the reason why hot water will melt them so much better than cold water mrs b it is so caloric may indeed be considered as having in every instance some share in the solution of a body by water since water however low its temperature may be always contains more or less caloric emily then perhaps water owes its solvent power merely to the caloric contained in it mrs b that probably would be carrying the speculation too far i should rather think that water and caloric unite their efforts to dissolve a body and that the difficulty or facility of effecting this depend both on the degree of attraction of aggregation to be overcome and on the arrangement of the particles which are more or less disposed to be divided and penetrated by the solvent emily but have not all liquids the same solvent power as water mrs b the solvent power of other liquids varies according to their nature and that of the substances submitted to their action most of these solvents indeed differ essentially from water as they do not merely separate the integrant particles of the bodies which they dissolve but attack their constituent principles by the power of chemical attraction thus producing a true decomposition these more complicated operations we must consider in another place and confine our attention at present to the solutions by water and caloric caroline but there are a variety of substances which when dissolved in water make it thick and muddy and destroy its transparency mrs b in this case it is not a solution but simply a mixture i shall show you the difference between a solution and a mixture by putting some common salt into one glass of water and some powder of chalk into another both these substances are white but their effect on the water will be very different caroline very different indeed the salt entirely disappears and leaves the water transparent whilst the chalk changes it into an opaque liquid like milk emily and would lumps of chalk and salt produce similar effects on water mrs b yes but not so rapidly salt is indeed soon melted though in a lump but chalk which does not mix so readily with water would require a much greater length of time i therefore preferred showing you the experiment with both substances reduced to powder which does not in any respect alter their nature but facilitates the operation merely by presenting a greater quantity of surface to the water i must not forget to mention a very curious circumstance respecting solutions which is that a fluid is not nearly so much increased in bulk by holding a body in solution as it would by mere mixture with the body caroline that seems impossible for two bodies cannot exist together in the same space mrs b two bodies may by condensation occupy less space when in union than when separate and this i can show you by an easy experiment this phial which contains some salt i shall fill with water pouring it in quickly so as not to dissolve much of the salt and when it is quite full i cork it if i now shake the phial till the salt is dissolved you will observe that it is no longer full caroline i shall try to add a little more salt but now you see mrs b the water runs over mrs b yes but observe that the last quantity of salt you put in remains solid at the bottom and displaces the water for it has already melted all the salt it is capable of holding in solution this is called the point of saturation and the water in this case is said to be saturated with salt emily i think i now understand the solution of a solid body by water perfectly but i have not so clear an idea of the solution of a liquid by caloric mrs b it is probably of a similar nature but as caloric is an invisible fluid its action as a solvent is not so obvious as that of water caloric we may conceive dissolves water and converts it into vapour by the same process as water dissolves salt that is to say the particles of water are so minutely divided by the caloric as to become invisible thus you are now enabled to understand why the vapour of boiling water when it first issues from the spout of a kettle is invisible it is so because it is then completely dissolved by caloric but the air with which it comes in contact being much colder than the vapour the latter yields to it a quantity of its caloric the particles of vapour being thus in a great measure deprived of their solvent gradually collect and become visible in the form of steam which is water in a state of imperfect solution and if you were further to deprive it of its caloric it would return to its original liquid state caroline that i understand very well if you hold a cold plate over a teaurn the steam issuing from it will be immediately converted into drops of water by parting with its caloric to the plate but in what state is the steam when it becomes invisible by being diffused in the air mrs b it is not merely diffused but is again dissolved by the air emily the air then has a solvent power like water and caloric mrs b this was formerly believed to be the case but it appears from more recent enquiries that the solvent power of the atmosphere depends solely upon the caloric contained in it sometimes the watery vapour diffused in the atmosphere is but imperfectly dissolved as is the case in the formation of clouds and fogs but if it gets into a region sufficiently warm it becomes perfectly invisible emily can any water dissolve in the atmosphere without its being previously converted into vapour by boiling mrs b unquestionably and this constitutes the difference between vaporization and evaporation water when heated to the boiling point can no longer exist in the form of water and must necessarily be converted into vapour or steam whatever may be the state and temperature of the surrounding medium this is called vaporization but the atmosphere by means of the caloric it contains can take up a certain portion of water at any temperature and hold it in a state of solution this is simply evaporation thus the atmosphere is continually carrying off moisture from the surface of the earth until it is saturated with it caroline that is the case no doubt when we feel the atmosphere damp mrs b on the contrary when the moisture is well dissolved it occasions no humidity it is only when in a state of imperfect solution and floating in the atmosphere in the form of watery vapour that it produces dampness this happens more frequently in winter than in summer for the lower the temperature of the atmosphere the less water it can dissolve and in reality it never contains so much moisture as in a dry hot summers day caroline you astonish me but why then is the air so dry in frosty weather when its temperature is at the lowest emily this i conjecture proceeds not so much from the moisture being dissolved as from its being frozen is not that the case mrs b it is and the freezing of the watery vapour which the atmospheric heat could not dissolve produces what is called a hoar frost for the particles descend in freezing and attach themselves to whatever they meet with on the surface of the earth the tendency of free caloric to an equilibrium together with its solvent power are likewise connected with the phenomena of rain of dew c when moist air of a certain temperature happens to pass through a colder region of the atmosphere it parts with a portion of its heat to the surrounding air the quantity of caloric therefore which served to keep the water in a state of vapour being diminished the watery particles approach each other and form themselves into drops of water which being heavier than the atmosphere descend to the earth there are also other circumstances and particularly the variation in the weight of the atmosphere which may contribute to the formation of rain this however is an intricate subject into which we cannot more fully enter at present emily in what manner do you account for the formation of dew mrs b dew is a deposition of watery particles or minute drops from the atmosphere precipitated by the coolness of the evening caroline this precipitation is owing i suppose to the cooling of the atmosphere which prevents its retaining so great a quantity of watery vapour in solution as during the heat of the day mrs b such was from time immemorial the generally received opinion respecting the cause of dew but it has been very recently proved by a course of ingenious experiments of dr wells that the deposition of dew is produced by the cooling of the surface of the earth which he has shown to take place previously to the cooling of the atmosphere for on examining the temperature of a plot of grass just before the dewfall he found that it was considerably colder than the air a few feet above it from which the dew was shortly after precipitated emily but why should the earth cool in the evening sooner than the atmosphere mrs b because it parts with its heat more readily than the air the earth is an excellent radiator of caloric whilst the atmosphere does not possess that property at least in any sensible degree towards evening therefore when the solar heat declines and when after sunset it entirely ceases the earth rapidly cools by radiating heat towards the skies whilst the air has no means of parting with its heat but by coming into contact with the cooled surface of the earth to which it communicates its caloric its solvent power being thus reduced it is unable to retain so large a portion of watery vapour and deposits those pearly drops which we call dew emily if this be the cause of dew we need not be apprehensive of receiving any injury from it for it can be deposited only on surfaces that are colder than the atmosphere which is never the case with our bodies mrs b very true yet i would not advise you for this reason to be too confident of escaping all the ill effects which may arise from exposure to the dew for it may be deposited on your clothes and chill you afterwards by its evaporation from them besides whenever the dew is copious there is a chill in the atmosphere which it is not always safe to encounter caroline wind then must promote the deposition of dew by bringing a more rapid succession of particles of air in contact with the earth just as it promotes the cooling of the earth and warming of the atmosphere during the heat of the day mrs b yes provided the wind be unattended with clouds for these accumulations of moisture not only prevent the free radiation of the earth towards the upper regions but themselves radiate towards the earth under these circumstances much less dew is formed than on fine clear nights when the radiation of the earth passes without obstacle through the atmosphere to the distant regions of space whence it receives no caloric in exchange the dew continues to be deposited during the night and is generally most abundant towards morning when the contrast between the temperature of the earth and that of the air is greatest after sunrise the equilibrium of temperature between these two bodies is gradually restored by the solar rays passing freely through the atmosphere to the earth and later in the morning the temperature of the earth gains the ascendency and gives out caloric to the air by contact in the same manner as it receives it from the air during the night can you tell me now why a bottle of wine taken fresh from the cellar in summer particularly will soon be covered with dew and even the glasses into which the wine is poured will be moistened with a similar vapour emily the bottle being colder than the surrounding air must absorb caloric from it the moisture therefore which that air contained becomes visible and forms the dew which is deposited on the bottle mrs b very well emily now caroline can you inform me why in a warm room or close carriage the contrary effect takes place that is to say that the inside of the windows is covered with vapour caroline i have heard that it proceeds from the breath of those within the room or the carriage and i suppose it is occasioned by the windows which being colder than the breath deprive it of part of its caloric and by this means convert it into watery vapour mrs b you have both explained it extremely well bodies attract dew in proportion as they are good radiators of caloric as it is this quality which reduces their temperature below that of the atmosphere hence we find that little or no dew is deposited on rocks sand water while grass and living vegetables to which it is so highly beneficial attract it in abundanceanother remarkable instance of the wise and bountiful dispensations of providence emily and we may again observe it in the abundance of dew in summer and in hot climates when its cooling effects are so much required but i do not understand what natural cause increases the dew in hot weather mrs b the more caloric the earth receives during the day the more it will radiate afterwards and consequently the more rapidly its temperature will be reduced in the evening in comparison to that of the atmosphere in the westindies especially where the intense heat of the day is strongly contrasted with the coolness of the evening the dew is prodigiously abundant during a drought the dew is less plentiful as the earth is not sufficiently supplied with moisture to be able to saturate the atmosphere caroline i have often observed mrs b that when i walk out in frosty weather with a veil over my face my breath freezes upon it pray what is the reason of that mrs b it is because the cold air immediately seizes on the caloric of your breath and by robbing it of its solvent reduces it to a denser fluid which is the watery vapour that settles on your veil and there it continues parting with its caloric till it is brought down to the temperature of the atmosphere and assumes the form of ice you may perhaps have observed that the breath of animals or rather the moisture contained in it is visible in damp weather or during a frost in the former case the atmosphere being oversaturated with moisture can dissolve no more in the latter the cold condenses it into visible vapour and for the same reason the steam arising from water that is warmer than the atmosphere becomes visible have you never taken notice of the vapour rising from your hands after having dipped them into warm water caroline frequently especially in frosty weather mrs b we have already observed that pressure is an obstacle to evaporation there are liquids that contain so great a quantity of caloric and whose particles consequently adhere so slightly together that they may be rapidly converted into vapour without any elevation of temperature merely by taking off the weight of the atmosphere in such liquids you perceive it is the pressure of the atmosphere alone that connects their particles and keeps them in a liquid state caroline i do not well understand why the particles of such fluids should be disunited and converted into vapour without any elevation of temperature in spite of the attraction of cohesion mrs b it is because the degree of heat at which we usually observe these fluids is sufficient to overcome their attraction of cohesion ether is of this description it will boil and be converted into vapour at the common temperature of the air if the pressure of the atmosphere be taken off emily i thought that ether would evaporate without either the pressure of the atmosphere being taken away or heat applied and that it was for that reason so necessary to keep it carefully corked up mrs b it is true it will evaporate but without ebullition what i am now speaking of is the vaporization of ether or its conversion into vapour by boiling i am going to show you how suddenly the ether in this phial will be converted into vapour by means of the airpump observe with what rapidity the bubbles ascend as i take off the pressure of the atmosphere caroline it positively boils how singular to see a liquid boil without heat mrs b now i shall place the phial of ether in this glass which it nearly fits so as to leave only a small space which i fill with water and in this state i put it again under the receiver plate iv fig 1 you will observe as i exhaust the air from it that whilst the ether boils the water freezes footnote two pieces of thin glass tubes sealed at one end might answer this purpose better the experiment however as here described is difficult and requires a very nice apparatus but if instead of phials or tubes two watchglasses be used water may be frozen almost instantly in the same manner the two glasses are placed over one another with a few drops of water interposed between them and the uppermost glass is filled with ether after working the pump for a minute or two the glasses are found to adhere strongly together and a thin layer of ice is seen between them caroline it is indeed wonderful to see water freeze in contact with a boiling fluid emily i am at a loss to conceive how the ether can pass to the state of vapour without an addition of caloric does it not contain more caloric in a state of vapour than in a state of liquidity mrs b it certainly does for though it is the pressure of the atmosphere which condenses it into a liquid it is by forcing out the caloric that belongs to it when in an ariform state emily you have therefore two difficulties to explain mrs b first from whence the ether obtains the caloric necessary to convert it into vapour when it is relieved from the pressure of the atmosphere and secondly what is the reason that the water in which the bottle of ether stands is frozen caroline now i think i can answer both these questions the ether obtains the addition of caloric required from the water in the glass and the loss of caloric which the latter sustains is the occasion of its freezing mrs b you are perfectly right and if you look at the thermometer which i have placed in the water whilst i am working the pump you will see that every time bubbles of vapour are produced the mercury descends which proves that the heat of the water diminishes in proportion as the ether boils emily this i understand now very well but if the water freezes in consequence of yielding its caloric to the ether the equilibrium of heat must in this case be totally destroyed yet you have told us that the exchange of caloric between two bodies of equal temperature was always equal how then is it that the water which was originally of the same temperature as the ether gives out caloric to it till the water is frozen and the ether made to boil mrs b i suspected that you would make these objections and in order to remove them i enclosed two thermometers in the airpump one which stands in the glass of water the other in the phial of ether and you may see that the equilibrium of temperature is not destroyed for as the thermometer descends in the water that in the ether sinks in the same manner so that both thermometers indicate the same temperature though one of them is in a boiling the other in a freezing liquid emily the ether then becomes colder as it boils this is so contrary to common experience that i confess it astonishes me exceedingly caroline it is indeed a most extraordinary circumstance but pray how do you account for it mrs b i cannot satisfy your curiosity at present for before we can attempt to explain this apparent paradox it is necessary to become acquainted with the subject of latent heat and that i think we must defer till our next interview caroline i believe mrs b that you are glad to put off the explanation for it must be a very difficult point to account for mrs b i hope however that i shall do it to your complete satisfaction emily but before we part give me leave to ask you one question would not water as well as ether boil with less heat if deprived of the pressure of the atmosphere mrs b undoubtedly you must always recollect that there are two forces to overcome in order to make a liquid boil or evaporate the attraction of aggregation and the weight of the atmosphere on the summit of a high mountain as mr de saussure ascertained on mount blanc much less heat is required to make water boil than in the plain where the weight of the atmosphere is greater indeed if the weight of the atmosphere be entirely removed by means of a good airpump and if water be placed in the exhausted receiver it will evaporate so fast however cold it maybe as to give it the appearance of boiling from the surface but without the assistance of the airpump i can show you a very pretty experiment which proves the effect of the pressure of the atmosphere in this respect observe that this florence flask is about half full of water and the upper half of invisible vapour the water being in the act of boiling i take it from the lamp and cork it carefullythe water you see immediately ceases boiling i shall now dip the flask into a bason of cold water footnote on the top of mount blanc water boiled when heated only to 187 degrees instead of 212 degrees footnote the same effect may be produced by wrapping a cold wet linen cloth round the upper part of the flask in order to show how much the water cools whilst it is boiling a thermometer graduated on the tube itself may be introduced into the bottle through the cork caroline but look mrs b the hot water begins to boil again although the cold water must rob it more and more of its caloric what can be the reason of that mrs b let us examine its temperature you see the thermometer immersed in it remains stationary at 180 degrees which is about 30 degrees below the boiling point when i took the flask from the lamp i observed to you that the upper part of it was filled with vapour this being compelled to yield its caloric to the cold water was again condensed into water what then filled the upper part of the flask emily nothing for it was too well corked for the air to gain admittance and therefore the upper part of the flask must be a vacuum mrs b the water below therefore no longer sustains the pressure of the atmosphere and will consequently boil at a much lower temperature thus you see though it had lost many degrees of heat it began boiling again the instant the vacuum was formed above it the boiling has now ceased the temperature of the water being still farther reduced if it had been ether instead of water it would have continued boiling much longer for ether boils under the usual atmospheric pressure at a temperature as low as 100 degrees and in a vacuum it boils at almost any temperature but water being a more dense fluid requires a more considerable quantity of caloric to make it evaporate quickly even when the pressure of the atmosphere is removed emily what proportion of vapour can the atmosphere contain in a state of solution mrs b i do not know whether it has been exactly ascertained by experiment but at any rate this proportion must vary both according to the temperature and the weight of the atmosphere for the lower the temperature and the greater the pressure the smaller must be the proportion of vapour that the atmosphere can contain to conclude the subject of free caloric i should mention ignition by which is meant that emission of light which is produced in bodies at a very high temperature and which is the effect of accumulated caloric emily you mean i suppose that light which is produced by a burning body mrs b no ignition is quite independent of combustion clay chalk and indeed all incombustible substances may be made red hot when a body burns the light emitted is the effect of a chemical change which takes place whilst ignition is the effect of caloric alone and no other change than that of temperature is produced in the ignited body all solid bodies and most liquids are susceptible of ignition or in other words of being heated so as to become luminous and it is remarkable that this takes place pretty nearly at the same temperature in all bodies that is at about 800 degrees of fahrenheits scale emily but how can liquids attain so high a temperature without being converted into vapour mrs b by means of confinement and pressure water confined in a strong iron vessel called papins digester can have its temperature raised to upwards of 400 degrees sir james hall has made some very curious experiments on the effects of heat assisted by pressure by means of strong gunbarrels he succeeded in melting a variety of substances which were considered as infusible and it is not unlikely that by similar methods water itself might be heated to redness emily i am surprised at that for i thought that the force of steam was such as to destroy almost all mechanical resistance mrs b the expansive force of steam is prodigious but in order to subject water to such high temperatures it is prevented by confinement from being converted into steam and the expansion of heated water is comparatively trifling but we have dwelt so long on the subject of free caloric that we must reserve the other modifications of that agent to our next meeting when we shall endeavour to proceed more rapidly conversation iv on combined caloric comprehending specific and latent heat mrs b we are now to examine the other modifications of caloric caroline i am very curious to know of what nature they can be for i have no notion of any kind of heat that is not perceptible to the senses mrs b in order to enable you to understand them it will be necessary to enter into some previous explanations it has been discovered by modern chemists that bodies of a different nature heated to the same temperature do not contain the same quantity of caloric caroline how could that be ascertained have you not told us that it is impossible to discover the absolute quantity of caloric which bodies contain mrs b true but at the same time i said that we were enabled to form a judgment of the proportions which bodies bore to each other in this respect thus it is found that in order to raise the temperature of different bodies the same number of degrees different quantities of caloric are required for each of them if for instance you place a pound of lead a pound of chalk and a pound of milk in a hot oven they will be gradually heated to the temperature of the oven but the lead will attain it first the chalk next and the milk last caroline that is a natural consequence of their different bulks the lead being the smallest body will be heated soonest and the milk which is the largest will require the longest time mrs b that explanation will not do for if the lead be the least in bulk it offers also the least surface to the caloric the quantity of heat therefore which can enter into it in the same space of time is proportionally smaller emily why then do not the three bodies attain the temperature of the oven at the same time mrs b it is supposed to be on account of the different capacity of these bodies for caloric caroline what do you mean by the capacity of a body for caloric mrs b i mean a certain disposition of bodies to require more or less caloric for raising their temperature to any degree of heat perhaps the fact may be thus explained let us put as many marbles into this glass as it will contain and pour some sand over themobserve how the sand penetrates and lodges between them we shall now fill another glass with pebbles of various formsyou see that they arrange themselves in a more compact manner than the marbles which being globular can touch each other by a single point only the pebbles therefore will not admit so much sand between them and consequently one of these glasses will necessarily contain more sand than the other though both of them be equally full caroline this i understand perfectly the marbles and the pebbles represent two bodies of different kinds and the sand the caloric contained in them it appears very plain from this comparison that one body may admit of more caloric between its particles than another mrs b you can no longer be surprised therefore that bodies of a different capacity for caloric should require different proportions of that fluid to raise their temperatures equally emily but i do not conceive why the body that contains the most caloric should not be of the highest temperature that is to say feel hot in proportion to the quantity of caloric it contains mrs b the caloric that is employed in filling the capacity of a body is not free caloric but is imprisoned as it were in the body and is therefore imperceptible for we can feel only the caloric which the body parts with and not that which it retains caroline it appears to me very extraordinary that heat should be confined in a body in such a manner as to be imperceptible mrs b if you lay your hand on a hot body you feel only the caloric which leaves it and enters your hand for it is impossible that you should be sensible of that which remains in the body the thermometer in the same manner is affected only by the free caloric which a body transmits to it and not at all by that which it does not part with caroline i begin to understand it but i confess that the idea of insensible heat is so new and strange to me that it requires some time to render it familiar mrs b call it insensible caloric and the difficulty will appear much less formidable it is indeed a sort of contradiction to call it heat when it is so situated as to be incapable of producing that sensation yet this modification of caloric is commonly called specific heat caroline but it certainly would have been more correct to have called it specific caloric emily i do not understand how the term specific applies to this modification of caloric mrs b it expresses the relative quantity of caloric which different species of bodies of the same weight and temperature are capable of containing this modification is also frequently called heat of capacity a term perhaps preferable as it explains better its own meaning you now understand i suppose why the milk and chalk required a longer portion of time than the lead to raise their temperature to that of the oven emily yes the milk and chalk having a greater capacity for caloric than the lead a greater proportion of that fluid became insensible in those bodies and the more slowly therefore their temperature was raised caroline but might not this difference proceed from the different conducting powers of heat in these three bodies since that which is the best conductor must necessarily attain the temperature of the oven first mrs b very well observed caroline this objection would be insurmountable if we could not by reversing the experiment prove that the milk the chalk and the lead actually absorbed different quantities of caloric and we know that if the different time they took in heating proceeded merely from their different conducting powers they would each have acquired an equal quantity of caloric caroline certainly but how can you reverse this experiment mrs b it may be done by cooling the several bodies to the same degree in an apparatus adapted to receive and measure the caloric which they give out thus if you plunge them into three equal quantities of water each at the same temperature you will be able to judge of the relative quantity of caloric which the three bodies contained by that which in cooling they communicated to their respective portions of water for the same quantity of caloric which they each absorbed to raise their temperature will abandon them in lowering it and on examining the three vessels of water you will find the one in which you immersed the lead to be the least heated that which held the chalk will be the next and that which contained the milk will be heated the most of all the celebrated lavoisier has invented a machine to estimate upon this principle the specific heat of bodies in a more perfect manner but i cannot explain it to you till you are acquainted with the next modification of caloric emily the more dense a body is i suppose the less is its capacity for caloric mrs b this is not always the case with bodies of different nature iron for instance contains more specific heat than tin though it is more dense this seems to show that specific heat does hot merely depend upon the interstices between the particles but probably also upon some peculiar constitution of the bodies which we do not comprehend emily but mrs b it would appear to me more proper to compare bodies by measure rather than by weight in order to estimate their specific heat why for instance should we not compare pints of milk of chalk and of lead rather than pounds of those substances for equal weights may be composed of very different quantities mrs b you are mistaken my dear equal weight must contain equal quantities of matter and when we wish to know what is the relative quantity of caloric which substances of various kinds are capable of containing under the same temperature we must compare equal weights and not equal bulks of those substances bodies of the same weight may undoubtedly be of very different dimensions but that does not change their real quantity of matter a pound of feathers does not contain one atom more than a pound of lead caroline i have another difficulty to propose it appears to me that if the temperature of the three bodies in the oven did not rise equally they would never reach the same degree the lead would always keep its advantage over the chalk and milk and would perhaps be boiling before the others had attained the temperature of the oven i think you might as well say that in the course of time you and i should be of the same age mrs b your comparison is not correct caroline as soon as the lead reached the temperature of the oven it would remain stationary for it would then give out as much heat as it would receive you should recollect that the exchange of radiating heat between two bodies of equal temperature is equal it would be impossible therefore for the lead to accumulate heat after having attained the temperature of the oven and that of the chalk and milk therefore would ultimately arrive at the same standard now i fear that this will not hold good with respect to our ages and that as long as i live i shall never cease to keep my advantage over you emily i think that i have found a comparison for specific heat which is very applicable suppose that two men of equal weight and bulk but who required different quantities of food to satisfy their appetites sit down to dinner both equally hungry the one would consume a much greater quantity of provisions than the other in order to be equally satisfied mrs b yes that is very fair for the quantity of food necessary to satisfy their respective appetites varies in the same manner as the quantity of caloric requisite to raise equally the temperature of different bodies emily the thermometer then affords no indication of the specific heat of bodies mrs b none at all no more than satiety is a test of the quantity of food eaten the thermometer as i have repeatedly said can be affected only by free caloric which alone raises the temperature of bodies but there is another mode of proving the existence of specific heat which affords a very satisfactory illustration of that modification this however i did not enlarge upon before as i thought it might appear to you rather complicated if you mix two fluids of different temperatures let us say the one at 50 degrees and the other at 100 degrees of what temperature do you suppose the mixture will be caroline it will be no doubt the medium between the two that is to say 75 degrees mrs b that will be the case if the two bodies happen to have the same capacity for caloric but if not a different result will be obtained thus for instance if you mix together a pound of mercury heated at 50 degrees and a pound of water heated at 100 degrees the temperature of the mixture instead of being 75 degrees will be 80 degrees so that the water will have lost only 12 degrees whilst the mercury will have gained 38 degrees from which you will conclude that the capacity of mercury for heat is less than that of water caroline i wonder that mercury should have so little specific heat did we not see it was a much better conductor of heat than water mrs b and it is precisely on that account that its specific heat is less for since the conductive power of bodies depends as we have observed before on their readiness to receive heat and part with it it is natural to expect that those bodies which are the worst conductors should absorb the most caloric before they are disposed to part with it to other bodies but let us now proceed to latent heat caroline and pray what kind of heat is that mrs b it is another modification of combined caloric which is so analogous to specific heat that most chemists make no distinction between them but mr pictet in his essay on fire has so clearly discriminated them that i am induced to adopt his view of the subject we therefore call latent heat that portion of insensible caloric which is employed in changing the state of bodies that is to say in converting solids into liquids or liquids into vapour when a body changes its state from solid to liquid or from liquid to vapour its expansion occasions a sudden and considerable increase of capacity for heat in consequence of which it immediately absorbs a quantity of caloric which becomes fixed in the body which it has transformed and as it is perfectly concealed from our senses it has obtained the name of latent heat caroline i think it would be much more correct to call this modification latent caloric instead of latent heat since it does not excite the sensation of heat mrs b this modification of heat was discovered and named by dr black long before the french chemists introduced the term caloric and we must not presume to alter it as it is still used by much better chemists than ourselves and besides you are not to suppose that the nature of heat is altered by being variously modified for if latent heat and specific heat do not excite the same sensations as free caloric it is owing to their being in a state of confinement which prevents them from acting upon our organs and consequently as soon as they are extricated from the body in which they are imprisoned they return to their state of free caloric emily but i do not yet clearly see in what respect latent heat differs from specific heat for they are both of them imprisoned and concealed in bodies mrs b specific heat is that which is employed in filling the capacity of a body for caloric in the state in which this body actually exists while latent heat is that which is employed only in effecting a change of state that is in converting bodies from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to an ariform state but i think that in a general point of view both these modifications might be comprehended under the name of heat of capacity as in both cases the caloric is equally engaged in filling the capacities of bodies i shall now show you an experiment which i hope will give you a clear idea of what is understood by latent heat the snow which you see in this phial has been cooled by certain chemical means which i cannot well explain to you at present to 5 or 6 degrees below the freezing point as you will find indicated by the thermometer which is placed in it we shall expose it to the heat of a lamp and you will see the thermometer gradually rise till it reaches the freezing point emily but there it stops mrs b and yet the lamp burns just as well as before why is not its heat communicated to the thermometer caroline and the snow begins to melt therefore it must be rising above the freezing point mrs b the heat no longer affects the thermometer because it is wholly employed in converting the ice into water as the ice melts the caloric becomes latent in the newformed liquid and therefore cannot raise its temperature and the thermometer will consequently remain stationary till the whole of the ice be melted caroline now it is all melted and the thermometer begins to rise again mrs b because the conversion of the ice into water being completed the caloric no longer becomes latent and therefore the heat which the water now receives raises its temperature as you find the thermometer indicates emily but i do not think that the thermometer rises so quickly in the water as it did in the ice previous to its beginning to melt though the lamp burns equally well mrs b that is owing to the different specific heat of ice and water the capacity of water for caloric being greater than that of ice more heat is required to raise its temperature and therefore the thermometer rises slower in the water than in the ice emily true you said that a solid body always increased its capacity for heat by becoming fluid and this is an instance of it mrs b yes and the latent heat is that which is absorbed in consequence of the greater capacity which the water has for heat in comparison to ice i must now tell you a curious calculation founded on that consideration i have before observed to you that though the thermometer shows us the comparative warmth of bodies and enables us to determine the same point at different times and places it gives us no idea of the absolute quantity of heat in any body we cannot tell how low it ought to fall by the privation of all heat but an attempt has been made to infer it in the following manner it has been found by experiment that the capacity of water for heat when compared with that of ice is as 10 to 9 so that at the same temperature ice contains one tenth of caloric less than water by experiment also it is observed that in order to melt ice there must be added to it as much heat as would if it did not melt it raise its temperature 140 degrees this quantity of heat is therefore absorbed when the ice by being converted into water is made to contain oneninth more caloric than it did before therefore 140 degrees is a ninth part of the heat contained in ice at 30 degrees and the point of zero or the absolute privation of heat must consequently be 1260 degrees below 32 degrees this mode of investigating so curious a question is ingenious but its correctness is not yet established by similar calculations for other bodies the points of absolute cold indicated by this method in various bodies are very remote from each other it is however possible that this may arise from some imperfection in the experiments caroline it is indeed very ingeniousbut we must now attend to our present experiment the water begins to boil and the thermometer is again stationary mrs b well caroline it is your turn to explain the phenomenon caroline it is wonderfully curious the caloric is now busy in changing the water into steam in which it hides itself and becomes insensible this is another example of latent heat producing a change of form at first it converted a solid body into a liquid and now it turns the liquid into vapour mrs b you see my dear how easily you have become acquainted with these modifications of insensible heat which at first appeared so unintelligible if now we were to reverse these changes and condense the vapour into water and the water into ice the latent heat would reappear entirely in the form of free caloric emily pray do let us see the effect of latent heat returning to its free state mrs b for the purpose of showing this we need simply conduct the vapour through this tube into this vessel of cold water where it will part with its latent heat and return to its liquid form emily how rapidly the steam heats the water mrs b that is because it does not merely impart its free caloric to the water but likewise its latent heat this method of heating liquids has been turned to advantage in several economical establishments the steamkitchens which are getting into such general use are upon the same principle the steam is conveyed through a pipe in a similar manner into the several vessels which contain the provisions to be dressed where it communicates to them its latent caloric and returns to the state of water count rumford makes great use of this principle in many of his fireplaces his grand maxim is to avoid all unnecessary waste of caloric for which purpose he confines the heat in such a manner that not a particle of it shall unnecessarily escape and while he economises the free caloric he takes care also to turn the latent heat to advantage it is thus that he is enabled to produce a degree of heat superior to that which is obtained in common fireplaces though he employs less fuel emily when the advantages of such contrivances are so clear and plain i cannot understand why they are not universally used mrs b a long time is always required before innovations however useful can be reconciled with the prejudices of the vulgar emily what a pity it is that there should be a prejudice against new inventions how much more rapidly the world would improve if such useful discoveries were immediately and universally adopted mrs b i believe my dear that there are as many novelties attempted to be introduced the adoption of which would be prejudicial to society as there are of those which would be beneficial to it the wellinformed though by no means exempt from error have an unquestionable advantage over the illiterate in judging what is likely or not to prove serviceable and therefore we find the former more ready to adopt such discoveries as promise to be really advantageous than the latter who having no other test of the value of a novelty but time and experience at first oppose its introduction the wellinformed however are frequently disappointed in their most sanguine expectations and the prejudices of the vulgar though they often retard the progress of knowledge yet sometimes it must be admitted prevent the propagation of error but we are deviating from our subject we have converted steam into water and are now to change water into ice in order to render the latent heat sensible as it escapes from the water on its becoming solid for this purpose we must produce a degree of cold that will make water freeze caroline that must be very difficult to accomplish in this warm room mrs b not so much as you think there are certain chemical mixtures which produce a rapid change from the solid to the fluid state or the reverse in the substances combined in consequence of which change latent heat is either extricated or absorbed emily i do not quite understand you mrs b this snow and salt which you see me mix together are melting rapidly heat therefore must be absorbed by the mixture and cold produced caroline it feels even colder than ice and yet the snow is melted this is very extraordinary mrs b the cause of the intense cold of the mixture is to be attributed to the change from a solid to a fluid state the union of the snow and salt produces a new arrangement of their particles in consequence of which they become liquid and the quantity of caloric required to effect this change is seized upon by the mixture wherever it can be obtained this eagerness of the mixture for caloric during its liquefaction is such that it converts part of its own free caloric into latent heat and it is thus that its temperature is lowered emily whatever you put in this mixture therefore would freeze mrs b yes at least any fluid that is susceptible of freezing at that temperature i have prepared this mixture of salt and snow for the purpose of freezing the water from which you are desirous of seeing the latent heat escape i have put a thermometer in the glass of water that is to be frozen in order that you may see how it cools caroline the thermometer descends but the heat which the water is now losing is its free not its latent heat mrs b certainly it does not part with its latent heat till it changes its state and is converted into ice emily but here is a very extraordinary circumstance the thermometer is fallen below the freezing point and yet the water is not frozen mrs b that is always the case previous to the freezing of water when it is in a state of rest now it begins to congeal and you may observe that the thermometer again rises to the freezing point caroline it appears to me very strange that the thermometer should rise the very moment that the water freezes for it seems to imply that the water was colder before it froze than when in the act of freezing mrs b it is so and after our long dissertation on this circumstance i did not think it would appear so surprising to you reflect a little and i think you will discover the reason of it caroline it must be no doubt the extrications of latent heat at the instant the water freezes that raises the temperature mrs b certainly and if you now examine the thermometer you will find that its rise was but temporary and lasted only during the disengagement of the latent heatnow that all the water is frozen it falls again and will continue to fall till the ice and mixture are of an equal temperature emily and can you show us any experiments in which liquids by being mixed become solid and disengage latent heat mrs b i could show you several but you are not yet sufficiently advanced to understand them well i shall however try one which will afford you a striking instance of the fact the fluid which you see in this phial consists of a quantity of a certain salt called muriat of lime dissolved in water now if i pour into it a few drops of this other fluid called sulphuric acid the whole or very nearly the whole will be instantaneously converted into a solid mass emily how white it turns i feel the latent heat escaping for the bottle is warm and the fluid is changed to a solid white substance like chalk caroline this is indeed the most curious experiment we have seen yet but pray what is that white vapour that ascends from the mixture mrs b you are not yet enough of a chemist to understand that but take care caroline do not approach too near it for it has a very pungent smell i shall show you another instance similar to that of the water which you observed to become warmer as it froze i have in this phial a solution of a salt called sulphat of soda or glaubers salt made very strong and corked up when it was hot and kept without agitation till it became cold as you may feel the phial is now when i take out the cork and let the air fall upon it for being closed when boiling there was a vacuum in the upper part observe that the salt will suddenly crystallize caroline surprising how beautifully the needles of salt have shot through the whole phial mrs b yes it is very strikingbut pray do not forget the object of the experiment feel how warm the phial has become by the conversion of part of the liquid into a solid emily quite warm i declare this is a most curious experiment of the disengagement of latent heat mrs b the slakeing of lime is another remarkable instance of the extrication of latent heat have you never observed how quicklime smokes when water is poured upon it and how much heat it produces caroline yes but i do not understand what change of state takes place in the lime that occasions its giving out latent heat for the quicklime which is solid is if i recollect right reduced to powder by this operation and is therefore rather expanded than condensed mrs b it is from the water not the lime that the latent heat is set free the water incorporates with and becomes solid in the lime in consequence of which the heat which kept it in a liquid state is disengaged and escapes in a sensible form caroline i always thought that the heat originated in the lime it seems very strange that water and cold water too should contain so much heat emily after this extrication of caloric the water must exist in a state of ice in the lime since it parts with the heat which kept it liquid mrs b it cannot properly be called ice since ice implies a degree of cold at least equal to the freezing point yet as water in combining with lime gives out more heat than in freezing it must be in a state of still greater solidity in the lime than it is in the form of ice and you may have observed that it does not moisten or liquefy the lime in the smallest degree emily but mrs b the smoke that rises is white if it was only pure caloric which escaped we might feel but could not see it mrs b this white vapour is formed by some of the particles of lime in a state of fine dust which are carried off by the caloric emily in all changes of state then a body either absorbs or disengages latent heat mrs b you cannot exactly say absorbs latent heat as the heat becomes latent only on being confined in the body but you may say generally that bodies in passing from a solid to a liquid form or from the liquid state to that of vapour absorb heat and that when the reverse takes place heat is disengaged footnote this rule if not universal admits of very few exceptions emily we can now i think account for the ether boiling and the water freezing in vacuo at the same temperature footnote see page 102 mrs b let me hear how you explain it emily the latent heat which the water gave out in freezing was immediately absorbed by the ether during its conversion into vapour and therefore from a latent state in one liquid it passed into a latent state in the other mrs b but this only partly accounts for the result of the experiment it remains to be explained why the temperature of the ether while in a state of ebullition is brought down to the freezing temperature of the water it is because the ether during its evaporation reduces its own temperature in the same proportion as that of the water by converting its free caloric into latent heat so that though one liquid boils and the other freezes their temperatures remain in a state of equilibrium emily but why does not water as well as ether reduce its own temperature by evaporating mrs b the fact is that it does though much less rapidly than ether thus for instance you may often have observed in the heat of summer how much any particular spot may be cooled by watering though the water used for that purpose be as warm as the air itself indeed so much cold may be produced by the mere evaporation of water that the inhabitants of india by availing themselves of the most favourable circumstances for this process which their warm climate can afford namely the cool of the night and situations most exposed to the night breeze succeed in causing water to freeze though the temperature of the air be as high as 60 degrees the water is put into shallow earthen trays so as to expose an extensive surface to the process of evaporation and in the morning the water is found covered with a thin cake of ice which is collected in sufficient quantity to be used for purposes of luxury caroline how delicious it must be to drink liquids so cold in those tropical climates but mrs b could we not try that experiment mrs b if we were in the country i have no doubt but that we should be able to freeze water by the same means and under similar circumstances but we can do it immediately upon a small scale in this very room in which the thermometer stands at 70 degrees for this purpose we need only place some water in a little cup under the receiver of the airpump plate v fig 1 and exhaust the air from it what will be the consequence caroline illustration plate v vol i page 138 fig 1 the airpump receiver for mr leslies experiment c a saucer with sulphuric acid b a glass or earthen cup containing water d a stand for the cup with its legs made of glass a a thermometer fig 2 dr wollastons cryophorus fig 5 dr marcets mode of using the cryophorus fig 3 4 the different parts of fig 5 seen separate caroline of course the water will evaporate more quickly since there will no longer be any atmospheric pressure on its surface but will this be sufficient to make the water freeze mrs b probably not because the vapour will not be carried off fast enough but this will be accomplished without difficulty if we introduce into the receiver fig 1 in a saucer or other large shallow vessel some strong sulphuric acid a substance which has a great attraction for water whether in the form of vapour or in the liquid state this attraction is such that the acid will instantly absorb the moisture as it rises from the water so as to make room for the formation of fresh vapour this will of course hasten the process and the cold produced from the rapid evaporation of the water will in a few minutes be sufficient to freeze its surface we shall now exhaust the air from the receiver footnote this experiment was first devised by mr leslie and has since been modified in a variety of forms emily thousands of small bubbles already rise through the water from the internal surface of the cup what is the reason of this mrs b these are bubbles of air which were partly attached to the vessel and partly diffused in the water itself and they expand and rise in consequence of the atmospheric pressure being removed caroline see mrs b the thermometer in the cup is sinking fast it has already descended to 40 degrees emily the water seems now and then violently agitated on the surface as if it was boiling and yet the thermometer is descending fast mrs b you may call it boiling if you please for this appearance is as well as boiling owing to the rapid formation of vapour but here as you have just observed it takes place from the surface for it is only when heat is applied to the bottom of the vessel that the vapour is formed there now crystals of ice are actually shooting all over the surface of the water caroline how beautiful it is the surface is now entirely frozenbut the thermometer remains at 32 degrees mrs b and so it will conformably with our doctrine of latent heat until the whole of the water is frozen but it will then again begin to descend lower and lower in consequence of the evaporation which goes on from the surface of the ice emily this is a most interesting experiment but it would be still more striking if no sulphuric acid were required mrs b i will show you a freezing instrument contrived by dr wollaston upon the same principle as mr leslies experiment by which water may be frozen by its own evaporation alone without the assistance of sulphuric acid this tube which as you see plate v fig 2 is terminated at each extremity by a bulb one of which is half full of water is internally perfectly exhausted of air the consequence of this is that the water in the bulb is always much disposed to evaporate this evaporation however does not proceed sufficiently fast to freeze the water but if the empty ball be cooled by some artificial means so as to condense quickly the vapour which rises from the water the process may be thus so much promoted as to cause the water to freeze in the other ball dr wollaston has called this instrument cryophorus caroline so that cold seems to perform here the same part which the sulphuric acid acted in mr leslies experiment mrs b exactly so but let us try the experiment emily how will you cool the instrument you have neither ice nor snow mrs b true but we have other means of effecting this you recollect what an intense cold can be produced by the evaporation of ether in an exhausted receiver we shall inclose the bulb in this little bag of fine flannel fig 3 then soke it in ether and introduce it into the receiver of the airpump fig 5 for this purpose we shall find it more convenient to use a cryophorus of this shape fig 4 as its elongated bulb passes easily through a brass plate which closes the top of the receiver if we now exhaust the receiver quickly you will see in less than a minute the water freeze in the other bulb out of the receiver footnote this mode of making the experiment was proposed and the particulars detailed by dr marcet in the 34th vol of nicholsons journal page 119 emily the bulb already looks quite dim and small drops of water are condensing on its surface caroline and now crystals of ice shoot all over the water this is indeed a very curious experiment mrs b you will see some other day that by a similar method even quicksilver may be frozen but we cannot at present indulge in any further digression having advanced so far on the subject of heat i may now give you an account of the calorimeter an instrument invented by lavoisier upon the principles just explained for the purpose of estimating the specific heat of bodies it consists of a vessel the inner surface of which is lined with ice so as to form a sort of hollow globe of ice in the midst of which the body whose specific heat is to be ascertained is placed the ice absorbs caloric from this body till it has brought it down to the freezing point this caloric converts into water a certain portion of the ice which runs out through an aperture at the bottom of the machine and the quantity of ice changed to water is a test of the quantity of caloric which the body has given out in descending from a certain temperature to the freezing point caroline in this apparatus i suppose the milk chalk and lead would melt different quantities of ice in proportion to their different capacities for caloric mrs b certainly and thence we are able to ascertain with precision their respective capacities for heat but the calorimeter affords us no more idea of the absolute quantity of heat contained in a body than the thermometer for though by means of it we extricate both the free and combined caloric yet we extricate them only to a certain degree which is the freezing point and we know not how much they contain of either below that point emily according to the theory of latent heat it appears to me that the weather should be warm when it freezes and cold in a thaw for latent heat is liberated from every substance that it freezes and such a large supply of heat must warm the atmosphere whilst during a thaw that very quantity of free heat must be taken from the atmosphere and return to a latent state in the bodies which it thaws mrs b your observation is very natural but consider that in a frost the atmosphere is so much colder than the earth that all the caloric which it takes from the freezing bodies is insufficient to raise its temperature above the freezing point otherwise the frost must cease but if the quantity of latent heat extricated does not destroy the frost it serves to moderate the suddenness of the change of temperature of the atmosphere at the commencement both of frost and of a thaw in the first instance its extrication diminishes the severity of the cold and in the latter its absorption moderates the warmth occasioned by a thaw it even sometimes produces a discernible chill at the breaking up of a frost caroline but what are the general causes that produce those sudden changes in the weather especially from hot to cold which we often experience mrs b this question would lead us into meteorological discussions to which i am by no means competent one circumstance however we can easily understand when the air has passed over cold countries it will probably arrive here at a temperature much below our own and then it must absorb heat from every object it meets with which will produce a general fall of temperature caroline but pray now that we know so much of the effects of heat will you inform us whether it is really a distinct body or as i have heard a peculiar kind of motion produced in bodies mrs b as i before told you there is yet much uncertainty as to the nature of these subtle agents but i am inclined to consider heat not as mere motion but as a separate substance late experiments too appear to make it a compound body consisting of the two electricities and in our next conversation i shall inform you of the principal facts on which that opinion is founded conversation v on the chemical agencies of electricity mrs b before we proceed further it will be necessary to give you some account of certain properties of electricity which have of late years been discovered to have an essential connection with the phenomena of chemistry caroline it is electricity if i recollect right which comes next in our list of simple substances mrs b i have placed electricity in that list rather from the necessity of classing it somewhere than from any conviction that it has a right to that situation for we are as yet so ignorant of its intimate nature that we are unable to determine not only whether it is simple or compound but whether it is in fact a material agent or as sir h davy has hinted whether it may not be merely a property inherent in matter as however it is necessary to adopt some hypothesis for the explanation of the discoveries which this agent has enabled us to make i have chosen the opinion at present most prevalent which supposes the existence of two kinds of electricity distinguished by the names of positive and negative electricity caroline well i must confess i do not feel nearly so interested in a science in which so much uncertainty prevails as in those which rest upon established principles i never was fond of electricity because however beautiful and curious the phenomena it exhibits may be the theories by which they were explained appeared to me so various so obscure and inadequate that i always remained dissatisfied i was in hopes that the new discoveries in electricity had thrown so great a light on the subject that every thing respecting it would now have been clearly explained mrs b that is a point which we are yet far from having attained but in spite of the imperfection of our theories you will be amply repaid by the importance and novelty of the subject the number of new facts which have already been ascertained and the immense prospect of discovery which has lately been opened to us will i hope ultimately lead to a perfect elucidation of this branch of natural science but at present you must be contented with studying the effects and in some degree explaining the phenomena without aspiring to a precise knowledge of the remote cause of electricity you have already obtained some notions of electricity in our present conversation therefore i shall confine myself to that part of the science which is of late discovery and is more particularly connected with chemistry it was a trifling and accidental circumstance which first gave rise to this new branch of physical science galvani a professor of natural philosophy at bologna being engaged about twenty years ago in some experiments on muscular irritability observed that when a piece of metal was laid on the nerve of a frog recently dead whilst the limb supplied by that nerve rested upon some other metal the limb suddenly moved on a communication being made between the two pieces of metal emily how is this communication made mrs b either by bringing the two metals into contact or by connecting them by means of a metallic conductor but without subjecting a frog to any cruel experiments i can easily make you sensible of this kind of electric action here is a piece of zinc one of the metals i mentioned in the list of elementary bodiesput it under your tongue and this piece of silver upon your tongue and let both the metals project a little beyond the tip of the tonguevery wellnow make the projecting parts of the metals touch each other and you will instantly perceive a peculiar sensation emily indeed i did a singular taste and i think a degree of heat but i can hardly describe it mrs b the action of these two pieces of metal on the tongue is i believe precisely similar to that made on the nerve of a frog i shall not detain you by a detailed account of the theory by which galvani attempted to account for this fact as his explanation was soon overturned by subsequent experiments which proved that galvanism the name this new power had obtained was nothing more than electricity galvani supposed that the virtue of this new agent resided in the nerves of the frog but volta who prosecuted this subject with much greater success shewed that the phenomena did not depend on the organs of the frog but upon the electrical agency of the metals which is excited by the moisture of the animal the organs of the frog being only a delicate test of the presence of electric influence caroline i suppose then the saliva of the mouth answers the same purpose as the moisture of the frog in exciting the electricity of the pieces of silver and zinc with which emily tried the experiment on her tongue mrs b precisely it does not appear however necessary that the fluid used for this purpose should be of an animal nature water and acids very much diluted by water are found to be the most effectual in promoting the developement of electricity in metals and accordingly the original apparatus which volta first constructed for this purpose consisted of a pile or succession of plates of zinc and copper each pair of which was connected by pieces of cloth or paper impregnated with water and this instrument from its original inconvenient structure and limited strength has gradually arrived at its present state of power and improvement such as is exhibited in the voltaic battery in this apparatus a specimen of which you see before you plate vi fig 1 the plates of zinc and copper are soldered together in pairs each pair being placed at regular distances in wooden troughs and the interstices being filled with fluid illustration plate vi p 151 fig 1 voltaic battery fig 2 fig 4 fig 1 2 4 voltaic batteries fig 3 electrical machine a the cylinder b the conductor r the rubber c the chain caroline though you will not allow us to enquire into the precise cause of electricity may we not ask in what manner the fluid acts on the metals so as to produce it mrs b the action of the fluid on the metals whether water or acid be used is entirely of a chemical nature but whether electricity is excited by this chemical action or whether it is produced by the contact of the two metals is a point upon which philosophers do not yet perfectly agree emily but can the mere contact of two metals without any intervening fluid produce electricity mrs b yes if they are afterwards separated it is an established fact that when two metals are put in contact and afterwards separated that which has the strongest attraction for oxygen exhibits signs of positive the other of negative electricity caroline it seems then but reasonable to infer that the power of the voltaic battery should arise from the contact of the plates of zinc and copper mrs b it is upon this principle that volta and sir h davy explain the phenomena of the pile but notwithstanding these two great authorities many philosophers entertain doubts on the truth of this theory the principal difficulty which occurs in explaining the phenomena of the voltaic battery on this principle is that two such plates show no signs of different states of electricity whilst in contact but only on being separated after contact now in the voltaic battery those plates that are in contact always continue so being soldered together and they cannot therefore receive a succession of charges besides if we consider the mere disturbance of the balance of electricity by the contact of the plates as the sole cause of the production of voltaic electricity it remains to be explained how this disturbed balance becomes an inexhaustible source of electrical energy capable of pouring forth a constant and copious supply of electrical fluid though without any means of replenishing itself from other sources this subject it must be owned is involved in too much obscurity to enable us to speak very decidedly in favour of any theory but in order to avoid perplexing you with different explanations i shall confine myself to one which appears to me to be least encumbered with difficulties and most likely to accord with truth this theory supposes the electricity to be excited by the chemical action of the acid on the zinc but you are yet such novices in chemistry that i think it will be necessary to give you some previous explanation of the nature of this action all metals have a strong attraction for oxygen and this element is found in great abundance both in water and in acids the action of the diluted acid on the zinc consists therefore in its oxygen combining with it and dissolving its surface footnote this mode of explaining the phenomena of the voltaic pile is called the chemical theory of electricity because it ascribes the cause of these phenomena to certain chemical changes which take place during their appearance in the preceding edition of this work the same theory was presented in a more elaborate but less easy form than it is in this the mode of viewing the subject which is here sketched was long since suggested by dr bostock of whose theory however this is by no means to be considered as a complete statement caroline in the same manner i suppose as we saw an acid dissolve copper mrs b yes but in the voltaic battery the diluted acid is not strong enough to produce so complete an effect it acts only on the surface of the zinc to which it yields its oxygen forming upon it a film or crust which is a compound of the oxygen and the metal emily since there is so strong a chemical attraction between oxygen and metals i suppose they are naturally in different states of electricity mrs b yes it appears that all metals are united with the positive and that oxygen is the grand source of the negative electricity caroline does not then the acid act on the plates of copper as well as on those of zinc mrs b no for though copper has an affinity for oxygen it is less strong than that of zinc and therefore the energy of the acid is only exerted upon the zinc it will be best i believe in order to render the action of the voltaic battery more intelligible to confine our attention at first to the effect produced on two plates only plate vi fig 2 if a plate of zinc be placed opposite to one of copper or any other metal less attractive of oxygen and the space between them suppose of half an inch in thickness be filled with an acid or any fluid capable of oxydating the zinc the oxydated surface will have its capacity for electricity diminished so that a quantity of electricity will be evolved from that surface this electricity will be received by the contiguous fluid by which it will be transmitted to the opposite metallic surface the copper which is not oxydated and is therefore disposed to receive it so that the copper plate will thus become positive whilst the zinc plate will be in the negative state this evolution of electrical fluid however will be very limited for as these two plates admit of but very little accumulation of electricity and are supposed to have no communication with other bodies the action of the acid and further developement of electricity will be immediately stopped emily this action i suppose can no more continue to go on than that of a common electrical machine which is not allowed to communicate with other bodies mrs b precisely the common electrical machine when excited by the friction of the rubber gives out both the positive and negative electricities plate vi fig 3 the positive by the rotation of the glass cylinder is conveyed into the conductor whilst the negative goes into the rubber but unless there is a communication made between the rubber and the ground but a very inconsiderable quantity of electricity can be excited for the rubber like the plates of the battery has too small a capacity to admit of an accumulation of electricity unless therefore the electricity can pass out of the rubber it will not continue to go into it and consequently no additional accumulation will take place now as one kind of electricity cannot be given out without the other the developement of the positive electricity is stopped as well as that of the negative and the conductor therefore cannot receive a succession of charges caroline but does not the conductor as well as the rubber require a communication with the earth in order to get rid of its electricity mrs b no for it is susceptible of receiving and containing a considerable quantity of electricity as it is much larger than the rubber and therefore has a greater capacity and this continued accumulation of electricity in the conductor is what is called a charge emily but when an electrical machine is furnished with two conductors to receive the two electricities i suppose no communication with the earth is required mrs b certainly not until the two are fully charged for the two conductors will receive equal quantities of electricity caroline i thought the use of the chain had been to convey the electricity from the ground into the machine mrs b that was the idea of dr franklin who supposed that there was but one kind of electricity and who by the terms positive and negative which he first introduced meant only different quantities of the same kind of electricity the chain was in that case supposed to convey electricity from the ground through the rubber into the conductor but as we have adopted the hypothesis of two electricities we must consider the chain as a vehicle to conduct the negative electricity into the earth emily and are both kinds of electricity produced whenever electricity is excited mrs b yes invariably if you rub a tube of glass with a woollen cloth the glass becomes positive and the cloth negative if on the contrary you excite a stick of sealingwax by the same means it is the rubber which becomes positive and the wax negative but with regard to the voltaic battery in order that the acid may act freely on the zinc and the two electricities be given out without interruption some method must be devised by which the plates may part with their electricities as fast as they receive them can you think of any means by which this might be effected emily would not two chains or wires suspended from either plate to the ground conduct the electricities into the earth and thus answer the purpose mrs b it would answer the purpose of carrying off the electricity i admit but recollect that though it is necessary to find a vent for the electricity yet we must not lose it since it is the power which we are endeavouring to obtain instead therefore of conducting it into the ground let us make the wires from either plate meet the two electricities will thus be brought together and will combine and neutralize each other and as long as this communication continues the two plates having a vent for their respective electricities the action of the acid will go on freely and uninterruptedly emily that is very clear so far as two plates only are concerned but i cannot say i understand how the energy of the succession of plates or rather pairs of plates of which the galvanic trough is composed is propagated and accumulated throughout a battery mrs b in order to shew you how the intensity of the electricity is increased by increasing the number of plates we will examine the action of four plates if you understand these you will readily comprehend that of any number whatever in this figure plate vi fig 4 you will observe that the two central plates are united they are soldered together as we observed in describing the voltaic trough so as to form but one plate which offers two different surfaces the one of copper the other of zinc now you recollect that in explaining the action of two plates we supposed that a quantity of electricity was evolved from the surface of the first zinc plate in consequence of the action of the acid and was conveyed by the interposed fluid to the copper plate no 2 which thus became positive this copper plate communicates its electricity to the contiguous zinc plate no 3 in which consequently some accumulation of electricity takes place when therefore the fluid in the next cell acts upon the zinc plate electricity is extricated from it in larger quantity and in a more concentrated form than before this concentrated electricity is again conveyed by the fluid to the next pair of plates no 4 and 5 when it is farther increased by the action of the fluid in the third cell and so on to any number of plates of which the battery may consist so that the electrical energy will continue to accumulate in proportion to the number of double plates the first zinc plate of the series being the most negative and the last copper plate the most positive caroline but does the battery become more and more strongly charged merely by being allowed to stand undisturbed mrs b no for the action will soon stop as was explained before unless a vent be given to the accumulated electricities this is easily done however by establishing a communication by means of the wires fig 1 between the two ends of the battery these being brought into contact the two electricities meet and neutralize each other producing the shock and other effects of electricity and the action goes on with renewed energy being no longer obstructed by the accumulation of the two electricities which impeded its progress emily is it the union of the two electricities which produces the electric spark mrs b yes and it is i believe this circumstance which gave rise to sir h davys opinion that caloric may be a compound of the two electricities caroline yet surely caloric is very different from the electrical spark mrs b the difference may consist probably only in intensity for the heat of the electric spark is considerably more intense though confined to a very minute spot than any heat we can produce by other means emily is it quite certain that the electricity of the voltaic battery is precisely of the same nature as that of the common electrical machine mrs b undoubtedly the shock given to the human body the spark the circumstance of the same substances which are conductors of the one being also conductors of the other and of those bodies such as glass and sealingwax which are nonconductors of the one being also nonconductors of the other are striking proofs of it besides sir h davy has shewn in his lectures that a leyden jar and a common electric battery can be charged with electricity obtained from a voltaic battery the effect produced being perfectly similar to that obtained by a common machine dr wollaston has likewise proved that similar chemical decompositions are effected by the electric machine and by the voltaic battery and has made other experiments which render it highly probable that the origin of both electricities is essentially the same as they show that the rubber of the common electrical machine like the zinc in the voltaic battery produces the two electricities by combining with oxygen caroline but i do not see whence the rubber obtains oxygen for there is neither acid nor water used in the common machine and i always understood that the electricity was excited by the friction mrs b it appears that by friction the rubber obtains oxygen from the atmosphere which is partly composed of that element the oxygen combines with the amalgam of the rubber which is of a metallic nature much in the same way as the oxygen of the acid combines with the zinc in the voltaic battery and it is thus that the two electricities are disengaged caroline but if the electricities of both machines are similar why not use the common machine for chemical decompositions mrs b though its effects are similar to those of the voltaic battery they are incomparably weaker indeed dr wollaston in using it for chemical decompositions was obliged to act upon the most minute quantities of matter and though the result was satisfactory in proving the similarity of its effects to those of the voltaic battery these effects were too small in extent to be in any considerable degree applicable to chemical decomposition caroline how terrible then the shock must be from a voltaic battery since it is so much more powerful than an electrical machine mrs b it is not nearly so formidable as you think at least it is by no means proportional to the chemical effect the great superiority of the voltaic battery consists in the large quantity of electricity that passes but in regard to the rapidity or intensity of the charge it is greatly surpassed by the common electrical machine it would seem that the shock or sensation depends chiefly upon the intensity whilst on the contrary for chemical purposes it is quantity which is required in the voltaic battery the electricity though copious is so weak as not to be able to force its way through the fluid which separates the plates whilst that of a common machine will pass through any space of water caroline would not it be possible to increase the intensity of the voltaic battery till it should equal that of the common machine mrs b it can actually be increased till it imitates a weak electrical machine so as to produce a visible spark when accumulated in a leyden jar but it can never be raised sufficiently to pass through any considerable extent of air because of the ready communication through the fluids employed by increasing the number of plates of a battery you increase its intensity whilst by enlarging the dimensions of the plates you augment its quantity and as the superiority of the battery over the common machine consists entirely in the quantity of electricity produced it was at first supposed that it was the size rather than the number of plates that was essential to the augmentation of power it was however found upon trial that the quantity of electricity produced by the voltaic battery even when of a very moderate size was sufficiently copious and that the chief advantage in this apparatus was obtained by increasing the intensity which however still falls very short of that of the common machine i should not omit to mention that a very splendid and at the same time most powerful battery was a few years ago constructed under the direction of sir h davy which he repeatedly exhibited in his course of electrochemical lectures it consists of two thousand double plates of zinc and copper of six square inches in dimensions arranged in troughs of wedgwoodware each of which contains twenty of these plates the troughs are furnished with a contrivance for lifting the plates out of them in a very convenient and expeditious manner footnote a model of this mode of construction is exhibited in plate xiii fig 1 caroline well now that we understand the nature of the action of the voltaic battery i long to hear an account of the discoveries to which it has given rise mrs b you must restrain your impatience my dear for i cannot with any propriety introduce the subject of these discoveries till we come to them in the regular course of our studies but as almost every substance in nature has already been exposed to the influence of the voltaic battery we shall very soon have occasion to notice its effects conversation vi on oxygen and nitrogen mrs b today we shall examine the chemical properties of the atmosphere caroline i thought that we were first to learn the nature of oxygen which come next in our table of simple bodies mrs b and so you shall the atmosphere being composed of two principles oxygen and nitrogen we shall proceed to analyse it and consider its component parts separately emily i always thought that the atmosphere had been a very complicated fluid composed of all the variety of exhalations from the earth mrs b such substances may be considered rather as heterogeneous and accidental than as forming any of its component parts and the proportion they bear to the whole mass is quite inconsiderable atmospherical air is composed of two gasses known by the names of oxygen gas and nitrogen or azotic gas emily pray what is a gas mrs b the name of gas is given to any fluid capable of existing constantly in an aeriform state under the pressure and at the temperature of the atmosphere caroline is not water or any other substance when evaporated by heat called gas mrs b no my dear vapour is indeed an elastic fluid and bears a strong resemblance to a gas there are however several points in which they essentially differ and by which you may always distinguish them steam or vapour owes its elasticity merely to a high temperature which is equal to that of boiling water and it differs from boiling water only by being united with more caloric which as we before explained is in a latent state when steam is cooled it instantly returns to the form of water but air or gas has never yet been rendered liquid or solid by any degree of cold emily but does not gas as well as vapour owe its elasticity to caloric mrs b it was the prevailing opinion and the difference of gas or vapour was thought to depend on the different manner in which caloric was united with the basis of these two kinds of elastic fluids in vapour it was considered as in a latent state in gas it was said to be chemically combined but the late researches of sir h davy have given rise to a new theory respecting gasses and there is now reason to believe that these bodies owe their permanently elastic state not solely to caloric but likewise to the prevalence of either the one or the other of the two electricities emily when you speak then of the simple bodies oxygen and nitrogen you mean to express those substances which are the basis of the two gasses mrs b yes in strict propriety for they can properly be called gasses only when brought to an aeriform state caroline in what proportions are they combined in the atmosphere mrs b the oxygen gas constitutes a little more than onefifth and the nitrogen gas a little less than fourfifths when separated they are found to possess qualities totally different from each other for oxygen gas is essential both to respiration and combustion while neither of these processes can be performed in nitrogen gas caroline but if nitrogen gas is unfit for respiration how does it happen that the large proportion of it which enters into the composition of the atmosphere is not a great impediment to breathing mrs b we should breathe more freely than our lungs could bear if we respired oxygen gas alone the nitrogen is no impediment to respiration and probably on the contrary answers some useful purpose though we do not know in what manner it acts in that process emily and by what means can the two gasses which compose the atmospheric air be separated mrs b there are many ways of analysing the atmosphere the two gasses may be separated first by combustion emily you surprise me how is it possible that combustion should separate them mrs b i should previously remind you that oxygen is supposed to be the only simple body naturally combined with negative electricity in all the other elements the positive electricity prevails and they have consequently all of them an attraction for oxygen footnote if chlorine or oxymuriatic gas be a simple body according to sir h davys view of the subject it must be considered as an exception to this statement but this subject cannot be discussed till the properties and nature of chlorine come under examination caroline oxygen the only negatively electrified body that surprises me extremely how then are the combinations of the other bodies performed if according to your explanation of chemical attraction bodies are supposed only to combine in virtue of their opposite states of electricity mrs b observe that i said that oxygen was the only simple body naturally negative compound bodies in which oxygen prevails over the other component parts are also negative but their negative energy is greater or less in proportion as the oxygen predominates those compounds into which oxygen enters in less proportion than the other constituents are positive but their positive energy is diminished in proportion to the quantity of oxygen which enters into their composition all bodies therefore that are not already combined with oxygen will attract it and under certain circumstances will absorb it from the atmosphere in which case the nitrogen gas will remain alone and may thus be obtained in its separate state caroline i do not understand how a gas can be absorbed mrs b it is only the oxygen or basis of the gas which is absorbed and the two electricities escaping that is to say the negative from the oxygen the positive from the burning body unite and produce caloric emily and what becomes of this caloric mrs b we shall make this piece of dry wood attract oxygen from the atmosphere and you will see what becomes of the caloric caroline you are joking mrs b you do not mean to decompose the atmosphere with a piece of dry stick mrs b not the whole body of the atmosphere certainly but if we can make this piece of wood attract any quantity of oxygen from it a proportional quantity of atmospherical air will be decomposed caroline if wood has so strong an attraction for oxygen why does it not decompose the atmosphere spontaneously mrs b it is found by experience that an elevation of temperature is required for the commencement of the union of the oxygen and the wood this elevation of temperature was formerly thought to be necessary in order to diminish the cohesive attraction of the wood and enable the oxygen to penetrate and combine with it more readily but since the introduction of the new theory of chemical combination another cause has been assigned and it is now supposed that the high temperature by exalting the electrical energies of bodies and consequently their force of attraction facilitates their combination emily if it is true that caloric is composed of the two electricities an elevation of temperature must necessarily augment the electric energies of bodies mrs b i doubt whether that would be a necessary consequence for admitting this composition of caloric it is only by its being decomposed that electricity can be produced sir h davy however in his numerous experiments has found it to be an almost invariable rule that the electrical energies of bodies are increased by elevation of temperature what means then shall we employ to raise the temperature of the wood so as to enable it to attract oxygen from the atmosphere caroline holding it near the fire i should think would answer the purpose mrs b it may provided you hold it sufficiently close to the fire for a very considerable elevation of temperature is required caroline it has actually taken fire and yet i did not let it touch the coals but i held it so very close that i suppose it caught fire merely from the intensity of the heat mrs b or you might say in other words that the caloric which the wood imbibed so much elevated its temperature and exalted its electric energy as to enable it to attract oxygen very rapidly from the atmosphere emily does the wood absorb oxygen while it is burning mrs b yes and the heat and light are produced by the union of the two electricities which are set at liberty in consequence of the oxygen combining with the wood caroline you astonish me the heat of a burning body proceeds then as much from the atmosphere as from the body itself mrs b it was supposed that the caloric given out during combustion proceeded entirely or nearly so from the decomposition of the oxygen gas but according to sir h davys new view of the subject both the oxygen gas and the combustible body concur in supplying the heat and light by the union of their opposite electricities emily i have not yet met with any thing in chemistry that has surprised or delighted me so much as this explanation of combustion i was at first wondering what connection there could be between the affinity of a body for oxygen and its combustibility but i think i understand it now perfectly mrs b combustion then you see is nothing more than the rapid combination of a body with oxygen attended by the disengagement of light and heat emily but are there no combustible bodies whose attraction for oxygen is so strong that they will combine with it without the application of heat caroline that cannot be otherwise we should see bodies burning spontaneously mrs b but there are some instances of this kind such as phosphorus potassium and some compound bodies which i shall hereafter make you acquainted with these bodies however are prepared by art for in general all the combustions that could occur spontaneously at the temperature of the atmosphere have already taken place therefore new combustions cannot happen without the temperature of the body being raised some bodies however will burn at a much lower temperature than others caroline but the common way of burning a body is not merely to approach it to one already on fire but rather to put the one in actual contact with the other as when i burn this piece of paper by holding it in the flame of the fire mrs b the closer it is in contact with the source of caloric the sooner will its temperature be raised to the degree necessary for it to burn if you hold it near the fire the same effect will be produced but more time will be required as you found to be the case with the piece of stick emily but why is it not necessary to continue applying caloric throughout the process of combustion in order to keep up the electric energy of the wood which is required to enable it to combine with the oxygen mrs b the caloric which is gradually produced by the two electricities during combustion keeps up the temperature of the burning body so that when once combustion has begun no further application of caloric is required caroline since i have learnt this wonderful theory of combustion i cannot take my eyes from the fire and i can scarcely conceive that the heat and light which i always supposed to proceed entirely from the coals are really produced as much by the atmosphere emily when you blow the fire you increase the combustion i suppose by supplying the coals with a greater quantity of oxygen gas mrs b certainly but of course no blowing will produce combustion unless the temperature of the coals be first raised a single spark however is sometimes sufficient to produce that effect for as i said before when once combustion has commenced the caloric disengaged is sufficient to elevate the temperature of the rest of the body provided that there be a free access of oxygen it however sometimes happens that if a fire be ill made it will be extinguished before all the fuel is consumed from the very circumstance of the combustion being so slow that the caloric disengaged is insufficient to keep up the temperature of the fuel you must recollect that there are three things required in order to produce combustion a combustible body oxygen and a temperature at which the one will combine with the other emily you said that combustion was one method of decomposing the atmosphere and obtaining the nitrogen gas in its simple state but how do you secure this gas and prevent it from mixing with the rest of the atmosphere mrs b it is necessary for this purpose to burn the body within a close vessel which is easily done we shall introduce a small lighted taper plate vii fig 1 under this glass receiver which stands in a bason over water to prevent all communication with the external air illustration plate vii vol i p 181 fig 1 combustion of a taper under a receiver fig 2 a retort on a stand fig 3 preparation of oxygen gas a furnace b earthen retort in the furnace c water bath d receiver ee tube conveying the gas from the retort through the water into the receiver fff shelf perforated on which the receiver stands fig 4 combustion of iron wire in oxygen gas caroline how dim the light burns already it is now extinguished mrs b can you tell us why it is extinguished caroline let me consider the receiver was full of atmospherical air the taper in burning within it must have combined with the oxygen contained in that air and the caloric that was disengaged produced the light of the taper but when the whole of the oxygen was absorbed the whole of its electricity was disengaged consequently no more caloric could be produced the taper ceased to burn and the flame was extinguished mrs b your explanation is perfectly correct emily the two constituents of the oxygen gas being thus disposed of what remains under the receiver must be pure nitrogen gas mrs b there are some circumstances which prevent the nitrogen gas thus obtained from being perfectly pure but we may easily try whether the oxygen has disappeared by putting another lighted taper under it you see how instantaneously the flame is extinguished for want of oxygen to supply the negative electricity required for the formation of caloric and were you to put an animal under the receiver it would immediately be suffocated but that is an experiment which i do not think your curiosity will tempt you to try emily certainly not but look mrs b the receiver is full of a thick white smoke is that nitrogen gas mrs b no my dear nitrogen gas is perfectly transparent and invisible like common air this cloudiness proceeds from a variety of exhalations which arise from the burning taper and the nature of which you cannot yet understand caroline the water within the receiver has now risen a little above its level in the bason what is the reason of this mrs b with a moments reflection i dare say you would have explained it yourself the water rises in consequence of the oxygen gas within it having been destroyed or rather decomposed by the combustion of the taper caroline then why did not the water rise immediately when the oxygen gas was destroyed mrs b because the heat of the taper whilst burning produced a dilatation of the air in the vessel which at first counteracted this effect another means of decomposing the atmosphere is the oxygenation of certain metals this process is very analogous to combustion it is indeed only a more general term to express the combination of a body with oxygen caroline in what respect then does it differ from combustion mrs b the combination of oxygen in combustion is always accompanied by a disengagement of light and heat whilst this circumstance is not a necessary consequence of simple oxygenation caroline but how can a body absorb oxygen without the combination of the two electricities which produce caloric mrs b oxygen does not always present itself in a gaseous state it is a constituent part of a vast number of bodies both solid and liquid in which it exists in a much denser state than in the atmosphere and from these bodies it may be obtained without much disengagement of caloric it may likewise in some cases be absorbed from the atmosphere without any sensible production of light and heat for if the process be slow the caloric is disengaged in such small quantities and so gradually that it is not capable of producing either light or heat in this case the absorption of oxygen is called oxygenation or oxydation instead of combustion as the production of sensible light and heat is essential to the latter emily i wonder that metals can unite with oxygen for as they are so dense their attraction of aggregation must be very great and i should have thought that oxygen could never have penetrated such bodies mrs b their strong attraction for oxygen counterbalances this obstacle most metals however require to be made redhot before they are capable of attracting oxygen in any considerable quantity by this combination they lose most of their metallic properties and fall into a kind of powder formerly called calx but now much more properly termed an oxyd thus we have oxyd of lead oxyd of iron c emily and in the voltaic battery it is i suppose an oxyd of zinc that is formed by the union of the oxygen with that metal mrs b yes it is caroline the word oxyd then simply means a metal combined with oxygen mrs b yes but the term is not confined to metals though chiefly applied to them any body whatever that has combined with a certain quantity of oxygen either by means of oxydation or combustion is called an oxyd and is said to be oxydated or oxygenated emily metals when converted into oxyds become i suppose negative mrs b not in general because in most oxyds the positive energy of the metal more than counterbalances the native energy of the oxygen with which it combines this black powder is an oxyd of manganese a metal which has so strong an affinity for oxygen that it attracts that substance from the atmosphere at any known temperature it is therefore never found in its metallic form but always in that of an oxyd in which state you see it has very little of the appearance of a metal it is now heavier than it was before oxydation in consequence of the additional weight of the oxygen with which it has combined caroline i am very glad to hear that for i confess i could not help having some doubts whether oxygen was really a substance as it is not to be obtained in a simple and palpable state but its weight is i think a decisive proof of its being a real body mrs b it is easy to estimate its weight by separating it from the manganese and finding how much the latter has lost emily but if you can take the oxygen from the metal shall we not then have it in its palpable simple state mrs b no for i can only separate the oxygen from the manganese by presenting to it some other body for which it has a greater affinity than for the manganese caloric affording the two electricities is decomposed and one of them uniting with the oxygen restores it to the ariform state emily but you said just now that manganese would attract oxygen from the atmosphere in which it is combined with the negative electricity how therefore can the oxygen have a superior affinity for that electricity since it abandons it to combine with the manganese mrs b i give you credit for this objection emily and the only answer i can make to it is that the mutual affinities of metals for oxygen and of oxygen for electricity vary at different temperatures a certain degree of heat will therefore dispose a metal to combine with oxygen whilst on the contrary the former will be compelled to part with the latter when the temperature is further increased i have put some oxyd of manganese into a retort which is an earthen vessel with a bent neck such as you see here plate vii fig 2 the retort containing the manganese you cannot see as i have enclosed it in this furnace where it is now redhot but in order to make you sensible of the escape of the gas which is itself invisible i have connected the neck of the retort with this bent tube the extremity of which is immersed in this vessel of water plate vii fig 3 do you see the bubbles of air rise through the water caroline perfectly this then is pure oxygen gas what a pity it should be lost could you not preserve it mrs b we shall collect it in this receiver for this purpose you observe i first fill it with water in order to exclude the atmospherical air and then place it over the bubbles that issue from the retort so as to make them rise through the water to the upper part of the receiver emily the bubbles of oxygen gas rise i suppose from their specific levity mrs b yes for though oxygen forms rather a heavy gas it is light compared to water you see how it gradually displaces the water from the receiver it is now full of gas and i may leave it inverted in water on this shelf where i can keep the gas as long as i choose for future experiments this apparatus which is indispensable in all experiments in which gases are concerned is called a waterbath caroline it is a very clever contrivance indeed equally simple and useful how convenient the shelf is for the receiver to rest upon under water and the holes in it for the gas to pass into the receiver i long to make some experiments with this apparatus mrs b i shall try your skill that way when you have a little more experience i am now going to show you an experiment which proves in a very striking manner how essential oxygen is to combustion you will see that iron itself will burn in this gas in the most rapid and brilliant manner caroline really i did not know that it was possible to burn iron emily iron is a simple body and you know caroline that all simple bodies are naturally positive and therefore must have an affinity for oxygen mrs b iron will however not burn in atmospherical air without a very great elevation of temperature but it is eminently combustible in pure oxygen gas and what will surprise you still more it can be set on fire without any considerable rise of temperature you see this spiral iron wirei fasten it at one end to this cork which is made to fit an opening at the top of the glassreceiver plate vii fig 4 emily i see the opening in the receiver but it is carefully closed by a ground glassstopper mrs b that is in order to prevent the gas from escaping but i shall take out the stopper and put in the cork to which the wire hangs now i mean to burn this wire in the oxygen gas but i must fix a small piece of lighted tinder to the extremity of it in order to give the first impulse to combustion for however powerful oxygen is in promoting combustion you must recollect that it cannot take place without some elevation of temperature i shall now introduce the wire into the receiver by quickly changing the stoppers caroline is there no danger of the gas escaping while you change the stoppers mrs b oxygen gas is a little heavier than atmospherical air therefore it will not mix with it very rapidly and if i do not leave the opening uncovered we shall not lose any caroline oh what a brilliant and beautiful flame emily it is as white and dazzling as the sun now a piece of the melted wire drops to the bottom i fear it is extinguished but no it burns again as bright as ever mrs b it will burn till the wire is entirely consumed provided the oxygen is not first expended for you know it can burn only while there is oxygen to combine with it caroline i never saw a more beautiful light my eyes can hardly bear it how astonishing to think that all this caloric was contained in the small quantity of gas and iron that was enclosed in the receiver and that without producing any sensible heat caroline how wonderfully quick combustion goes on in pure oxygen gas but pray are these drops of burnt iron as heavy as the wire was before mrs b they are even heavier for the iron in burning has acquired exactly the weight of the oxygen which has disappeared and is now combined with it it has become an oxyd of iron caroline i do not know what you mean by saying that the oxygen has disappeared mrs b for it was always invisible mrs b true my dear the expression was incorrect but though you could not see the oxygen gas i believe you had no doubt of its presence as the effect it produced on the wire was sufficiently evident caroline yes indeed yet you know it was the caloric and not the oxygen gas itself that dazzled us so much mrs b you are not quite correct in your turn in saying the caloric dazzled you for caloric is invisible it affects only the sense of feeling it was the light which dazzled you caroline true but light and caloric are such constant companions that it is difficult to separate them even in idea mrs b the easier it is to confound them the more careful you should be in making the distinction caroline but why has the water now risen and filled part of the receiver mrs b indeed caroline i did not suppose you would have asked such a question i dare say emily you can answer it emily let me reflect the oxygen has combined with the wire the caloric has escaped consequently nothing can remain in the receiver and the water will rise to fill the vacuum caroline i wonder that i did not think of that i wish that we had weighed the wire and the oxygen gas before combustion we might then have found whether the weight of the oxyd was equal to that of both mrs b you might try the experiment if you particularly wished it but i can assure you that if accurately performed it never fails to show that the additional weight of the oxyd is precisely equal to that of the oxygen absorbed whether the process has been a real combustion or a simple oxygenation caroline but this cannot be the case with combustions in general for when any substance is burnt in the common air so far from increasing in weight it is evidently diminished and sometimes entirely consumed mrs b but what do you mean by the expression consumed you cannot suppose that the smallest particle of any substance in nature can be actually destroyed a compound body is decomposed by combustion some of its constituent parts fly off in a gaseous form while others remain in a concrete state the former are called the volatile the latter the fixed products of combustion but if we collect the whole of them we shall always find that they exceed the weight of the combustible body by that of the oxygen which has combined with them during combustion emily in the combustion of a coal fire then i suppose that the ashes are what would be called the fixed product and the smoke the volatile product mrs b yet when the fire burns best and the quantity of volatile products should be the greatest there is no smoke how can you account for that emily indeed i cannot therefore i suppose that i was not right in my conjecture mrs b not quite ashes as you supposed are a fixed product of combustion but smoke properly speaking is not one of the volatile products as it consists of some minute undecomposed particles of the coals that are carried off by the heated air without being burnt and are either deposited in the form of soot or dispersed by the wind smoke therefore ultimately becomes one of the fixed products of combustion and you may easily conceive that the stronger the fire is the less smoke is produced because the fewer particles escape combustion on this principle depends the invention of argands patent lamps a current of air is made to pass through the cylindrical wick of the lamp by which means it is so plentifully supplied with oxygen that scarcely a particle of oil escapes combustion nor is there any smoke produced emily but what then are the volatile products of combustion mrs b various new compounds with which you are not yet acquainted and which being converted by caloric either into vapour or gas are invisible but they can be collected and we shall examine them at some future period caroline there are then other gases besides the oxygen and nitrogen gases mrs b yes several any substance that can assume and maintain the form of an elastic fluid at the temperature of the atmosphere is called a gas we shall examine the several gases in their respective places but we must now confine our attention to those that compose the atmosphere i shall show you another method of decomposing the atmosphere which is very simple in breathing we retain a portion of the oxygen and expire the nitrogen gas so that if we breathe in a closed vessel for a certain length of time the air within it will be deprived of its oxygen gas which of you will make the experiment caroline i should be very glad to try it mrs b very well breathe several times through this glass tube into the receiver with which it is connected until you feel that your breath is exhausted caroline i am quite out of breath already mrs b now let us try the gas with a lighted taper emily it is very pure nitrogen gas for the taper is immediately extinguished mrs b that is not a proof of its being pure but only of the absence of oxygen as it is that principle alone which can produce combustion every other gas being absolutely incapable of it emily in the methods which you have shown us for decomposing the atmosphere the oxygen always abandons the nitrogen but is there no way of taking the nitrogen from the oxygen so as to obtain the latter pure from the atmosphere mrs b you must observe that whenever oxygen is taken from the atmosphere it is by decomposing the oxygen gas we cannot do the same with the nitrogen gas because nitrogen has a stronger affinity for caloric than for any other known principle it appears impossible therefore to separate it from the atmosphere by the power of affinities but if we cannot obtain the oxygen gas by this means in its separate state we have no difficulty as you have seen to procure it in its gaseous form by taking it from those substances that have absorbed it from the atmosphere as we did with the oxyd of manganese emily can atmospherical air be recomposed by mixing due proportions of oxygen and nitrogen gases mrs b yes if about one part of oxygen gas be mixed with about four parts of nitrogen gas atmospherical air is produced footnote the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere varies from 21 to 22 per cent emily the air then must be an oxyd of nitrogen mrs b no my dear for there must be a chemical combination between oxygen and nitrogen in order to produce an oxyd whilst in the atmosphere these two substances are separately combined with caloric forming two distinct gases which are simply mixed in the formation of the atmosphere i shall say nothing more of oxygen and nitrogen at present as we shall continually have occasion to refer to them in our future conversations they are both very abundant in nature nitrogen is the most plentiful in the atmosphere and exists also in all animal substances oxygen forms a constituent part both of the animal and vegetable kingdoms from which it may be obtained by a variety of chemical means but it is now time to conclude our lesson i am afraid you have learnt more today than you will be able to remember caroline i assure you that i have been too much interested in it ever to forget it in regard to nitrogen there seems to be but little to remember it makes a very insignificant figure in comparison to oxygen although it composes a much larger portion of the atmosphere mrs b perhaps this insignificance you complain of may arise from the compound nature of nitrogen for though i have hitherto considered it as a simple body because it is not known in any natural process to be decomposed yet from some experiments of sir h davy there appears to be reason for suspecting that nitrogen is a compound body as we shall see afterwards but even in its simple state it will not appear so insignificant when you are better acquainted with it for though it seems to perform but a passive part in the atmosphere and has no very striking properties when considered in its separate state yet you will see byandbye what a very important agent it becomes when combined with other bodies but no more of this at present we must reserve it for its proper place conversation vii on hydrogen caroline the next simple bodies we come to are chlorine and iodine pray what kinds of substances are these are they also invisible mrs b no for chlorine in the state of gas has a distinct greenish colour and is therefore visible and iodine in the same state has a beautiful claretred colour the knowledge of these two bodies however and the explanation of their properties imply various considerations which you would not yet be able to understand we shall therefore defer their examination to some future conversation and we shall pass on to the next simple substance hydrogen which we cannot any more than oxygen obtain in a visible or palpable form we are acquainted with it only in its gaseous state as we are with oxygen and nitrogen caroline but in its gaseous state it cannot be called a simple substance since it is combined with heat and electricity mrs b true my dear but as we do not know in nature of any substance which is not more or less combined with caloric and electricity we are apt to say that a substance is in its pure state when combined with those agents only hydrogen was formerly called inflammable air as it is extremely combustible and burns with a great flame since the invention of the new nomenclature it has obtained the name of hydrogen which is derived from two greek words the meaning of which is to produce water emily and how does hydrogen produce water mrs b by its combustion water is composed of eightyfive parts by weight of oxygen combined with fifteen parts of hydrogen or of two parts by bulk of hydrogen gas to one part of oxygen gas caroline really is it possible that water should be a combination of two gases and that one of these should be inflammable air hydrogen must be a most extraordinary gas that will produce both fire and water emily but i thought you said that combustion could take place in no gas but oxygen mrs b do you recollect what the process of combustion consists in emily in the combination of a body with oxygen with disengagement of light and heat mrs b therefore when i say that hydrogen is combustible i mean that it has an affinity for oxygen but like all other combustible substances it cannot burn unless supplied with oxygen and also heated to a proper temperature caroline the simply mixing fifteen parts of hydrogen with eightyfive parts of oxygen gas will not therefore produce water mrs b no water being a much denser fluid than gases in order to reduce these gases to a liquid it is necessary to diminish the quantity of caloric or electricity which maintains them in an elastic form emily that i should think might be done by combining the oxygen and hydrogen together for in combining they would give out their respective electricities in the form of caloric and by this means would be condensed caroline but you forget emily that in order to make the oxygen and hydrogen combine you must begin by elevating their temperature which increases instead of diminishing their electric energies mrs b emily is however right for though it is necessary to raise their temperature in order to make them combine as that combination affords them the means of parting with their electricities it is eventually the cause of the diminution of electric energy caroline you love to deal in paradoxes today mrs b fire then produces water mrs b the combustion of hydrogen gas certainly does but you do not seem to have remembered the theory of combustion so well as you thought you would can you tell me what happens in the combustion of hydrogen gas caroline the hydrogen combines with the oxygen and their opposite electricities are disengaged in the form of caloric yes i think i understand it nowby the loss of this caloric the gases are condensed into a liquid emily water then i suppose when it evaporates and incorporates with the atmosphere is decomposed and converted into hydrogen and oxygen gases mrs b no my dearthere you are quite mistaken the decomposition of water is totally different from its evaporation for in the latter case as you should recollect water is only in a state of very minute division and is merely suspended in the atmosphere without any chemical combination and without any separation of its constituent parts as long as these remain combined they form water whether in a state of liquidity or in that of an elastic fluid as vapour or under the solid form of ice in our experiments on latent heat you may recollect that we caused water successively to pass through these three forms merely by an increase or diminution of caloric without employing any power of attraction or effecting any decomposition caroline but are there no means of decomposing water mrs b yes several charcoal and metals when heated red hot will attract the oxygen from water in the same manner as they will from the atmosphere caroline hydrogen i see is like nitrogen a poor dependant friend of oxygen which is continually forsaken for greater favourites mrs b the connection or friendship as you choose to call it is much more intimate between oxygen and hydrogen in the state of water than between oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere for in the first case there is a chemical union and condensation of the two substances in the latter they are simply mixed together in their gaseous state you will find however that in some cases nitrogen is quite as intimately connected with oxygen as hydrogen is but this is foreign to our present subject emily water then is an oxyd though the atmospherical air is not mrs b it is not commonly called an oxyd though according to our definition it may no doubt be referred to that class of bodies caroline i should like extremely to see water decomposed mrs b i can gratify your curiosity by a much more easy process than the oxydation of charcoal or metals the decomposition of water by these latter means takes up a great deal of time and is attended with much trouble for it is necessary that the charcoal or metal should be made red hot in a furnace that the water should pass over them in a state of vapour that the gas formed should be collected over the waterbath c in short it is a very complicated affair but the same effect may be produced with the greatest facility by the action of the voltaic battery which this will give me an opportunity of exhibiting caroline i am very glad of that for i longed to see the power of this apparatus in decomposing bodies mrs b for this purpose i fill this piece of glasstube plate viii fig 1 with water and cork it up at both ends through one of the corks i introduce that wire of the battery which conveys the positive electricity and the wire which conveys the negative electricity is made to pass through the other cork so that the two wires approach each other sufficiently near to give out their respective electricities illustration plate viii vol i p 206 fig 1 apparatus for the decomposition of water

the combustion of hydrogen gas caroline it does not appear to me that you approach the wires so near as you did when you made the battery act by itself mrs b water being a better conductor of electricity than air the two wires will act on each other at a greater distance in the former than in the latter emily now the electrical effect appears i see small bubbles of air emitted from each wire mrs b each wire decomposes the water the positive by combining with its oxygen which is negative the negative by combining with its hydrogen which is positive caroline that is wonderfully curious but what are the small bubbles of air mrs b those that appear to proceed from the positive wire are the result of the decomposition of the water by that wire that is to say the positive electricity having combined with some of the oxygen of the water the particles of hydrogen which were combined with that portion of oxygen are set at liberty and appear in the form of small bubbles of gas or air emily and i suppose the negative fluid having in the same manner combined with some of the hydrogen of the water the particles of oxygen that were combined with it are set free and emitted in a gaseous form mrs b precisely so but i should not forget to observe that the wires used in this experiment are made of platina a metal which is not capable of combining with oxygen for otherwise the wire would combine with the oxygen and the hydrogen alone would be disengaged caroline but could not water be decomposed without the electric circle being completed if for instance you immersed only the positive wire in the water would it not combine with the oxygen and the hydrogen gas be given out mrs b no for as you may recollect the battery cannot act unless the circle be completed since the positive wire will not give out its electricity unless attracted by that of the negative wire caroline i understand it now but look mrs b the decomposition of the water which has now been going on for some time does not sensibly diminish its quantitywhat is the reason of that mrs b because the quantity decomposed is so extremely small if you compare the density of water with that of the gases into which it is resolved you must be aware that a single drop of water is sufficient to produce thousands of such small bubbles as those you now perceive caroline but in this experiment we obtain the oxygen and hydrogen gases mixed together is there any means of procuring the two gases separately mrs b they can be collected separately with great ease by modifying a little the experiment thus if instead of one tube we employ two as you see here c d plate viii fig 2 both tubes being closed at one end and open at the other and if after filling these tubes with water we place them standing in a glass of water e with their open end downwards you will see that the moment we connect the wires a b which proceed upwards from the interior of each tube the one with one end of the battery and the other with the other end the water in the tubes will be decomposed hydrogen will be given out round the wire in the tube connected with the positive end of the battery and oxygen in the other and these gases will be evolved exactly in the proportions which i have before mentioned namely two measures of hydrogen for one of oxygen we shall now begin the experiment but it will be some time before any sensible quantity of the gases can be collected emily the decomposition of water in this way slow as it is is certainly very striking but i confess that i should be still more gratified if you could shew it us on a larger scale and by a quicker process i am sorry that the decomposition of water by charcoal or metals is attended with so much inconvenience mrs b water may be decomposed by means of metals without any difficulty but for this purpose the intervention of an acid is required thus if we add some sulphuric acid a substance with the nature of which you are not yet acquainted to the water which the metal is to decompose the acid disposes the metal to combine with the oxygen of the water so readily and abundantly that no heat is required to hasten the process of this i am going to shew you an instance i put into this bottle the water that is to be decomposed as also the metal that is to effect that decomposition by combining with the oxygen and the acid which is to facilitate the combination of the metal and the oxygen you will see with what violence these will act on each other caroline but what metal is it that you employ for this purpose mrs b it is iron and it is used in the state of filings as these present a greater surface to the acid than a solid piece of metal for as it is the surface of the metal which is acted upon by the acid and is disposed to receive the oxygen produced by the decomposition of the water it necessarily follows that the greater is the surface the more considerable is the effect the bubbles which are now rising are hydrogen gas caroline how disagreeably it smells mrs b it is indeed unpleasant though i believe not particularly hurtful we shall not however suffer any more to escape as it will be wanted for experiments i shall therefore collect it in a glassreceiver by making it pass through this bent tube which will conduct it into the waterbath plate viii fig 3 emily how very rapidly the gas escapes it is perfectly transparent and without any colour whatever now the receiver is full mrs b we shall therefore remove it and substitute another in its place but you must observe that when the receiver is full it is necessary to keep it inverted with the mouth under water otherwise the gas would escape and in order that it may not be in the way i introduce within the bath under the water a saucer into which i slide the receiver so that it can be taken out of the bath and conveyed any where the water in the saucer being equally effectual in preventing its escape as that in the bath plate viii fig 4 emily i am quite surprised to see what a large quantity of hydrogen gas can be produced by such a small quantity of water especially as oxygen is the principal constituent of water mrs b in weight it is but not in volume for though the proportion by weight is nearly six parts of oxygen to one of hydrogen yet the proportion of the volume of the gases is about one part of oxygen to two of hydrogen so much heavier is the former than the latter caroline but why is the vessel in which the water is decomposed so hot as the water changes from a liquid to a gaseous form cold should be produced instead of heat mrs b no for if one of the constituents of water is converted into a gas the other becomes solid in combining with the metal emily in this case then neither heat nor cold should be produced mrs b true but observe that the sensible heat which is disengaged in this operation is not owing to the decomposition of the water but to an extrication of heat produced by the mixture of water and sulphuric acid i will mix some water and sulphuric acid together in this glass that you may feel the surprising quantity of heat that is disengaged by their unionnow take hold of the glass caroline indeed i cannot it feels as hot as boiling water i should have imagined there would have been heat enough disengaged to have rendered the liquid solid mrs b as however it does not produce that effect we cannot refer this heat to the modification called latent heat we may however i think consider it as heat of capacity as the liquid is condensed by its loss and if you were to repeat the experiment in a graduated tube you would find that the two liquids when mixed occupy considerably less space than they did separately but we will reserve this to another opportunity and attend at present to the hydrogen gas which we have been producing if i now set the hydrogen gas which is contained in this receiver at liberty all at once and kindle it as soon as it comes in contact with the atmosphere by presenting it to a candle it will so suddenly and rapidly decompose the oxygen gas by combining with its basis that an explosion or a detonation as chemists commonly call it will be produced for this purpose i need only take up the receiver and quickly present its open mouth to the candle so caroline it produced only a sort of hissing noise with a vivid flash of light i had expected a much greater report mrs b and so it would have been had the gases been closely confined at the moment they were made to explode if for instance we were to put in this bottle a mixture of hydrogen gas and atmospheric air and if after corking the bottle we should kindle the mixture by a very small orifice from the sudden dilatation of the gases at the moment of their combination the bottle must either fly to pieces or the cork be blown out with considerable violence caroline but in the experiment which we have just seen if you did not kindle the hydrogen gas would it not equally combine with the oxygen mrs b certainly not for as i have just explained to you it is necessary that the oxygen and hydrogen gases be burnt together in order to combine chemically and produce water caroline that is true but i thought this was a different combination for i see no water produced mrs b the water resulting from this detonation was so small in quantity and in such a state of minute division as to be invisible but water certainly was produced for oxygen is incapable of combining with hydrogen in any other proportions than those that form water therefore water must always be the result of their combination if instead of bringing the hydrogen gas into sudden contact with the atmosphere as we did just now so as to make the whole of it explode the moment it is kindled we allow but a very small surface of gas to burn in contact with the atmosphere the combustion goes on quietly and gradually at the point of contact without any detonation because the surfaces brought together are too small for the immediate union of gases the experiment is a very easy one this phial with a narrow neck plate viii fig 5 is full of hydrogen gas and is carefully corked if i take out the cork without moving the phial and quickly approach the candle to the orifice you will see how different the result will be emily how prettily it burns with a blue flame the flame is gradually sinking within the phialnow it has entirely disappeared but does not this combustion likewise produce water mrs b undoubtedly in order to make the formation of the water sensible to you i shall procure a fresh supply of hydrogen gas by putting into this bottle plate viii fig 6 iron filings water and sulphuric acid materials similar to those which we have just used for the same purpose i shall then cork up the bottle leaving only a small orifice in the cork with a piece of glasstube fixed to it through which the gas will issue in a continued rapid stream caroline i hear already the hissing of the gas through the tube and i can feel a strong current against my hand mrs b this current i am going to kindle with the candlesee how vividly it burns emily it burns like a candle with a long flame but why does this combustion last so much longer than in the former experiment mrs b the combustion goes on uninterruptedly as long as the new gas continues to be produced now if i invert this receiver over the flame you will soon perceive its internal surface covered with a very fine dew which is pure water caroline yes indeed the glass is now quite dim with moisture how glad i am that we can see the water produced by this combustion emily it is exactly what i was anxious to see for i confess i was a little incredulous mrs b if i had not held the glassbell over the flame the water would have escaped in the state of vapour as it did in the former experiment we have here of course obtained but a very small quantity of water but the difficulty of procuring a proper apparatus with sufficient quantities of gases prevents my showing it you on a larger scale the composition of water was discovered about the same period both by mr cavendish in this country and by the celebrated french chemist lavoisier the latter invented a very perfect and ingenious apparatus to perform with great accuracy and upon a large scale the formation of water by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen gases two tubes conveying due proportions the one of oxygen the other of hydrogen gas are inserted at opposite sides of a large globe of glass previously exhausted of air the two streams of gas are kindled within the globe by the electrical spark at the point where they come in contact they burn together that is to say the hydrogen combines with the oxygen the caloric is set at liberty and a quantity of water is produced exactly equal in weight to that of the two gases introduced into the globe caroline and what was the greatest quantity of water ever formed in this apparatus mrs b several ounces indeed very nearly a pound if i recollect right but the operation lasted many days emily this experiment must have convinced all the world of the truth of the discovery pray if improper proportions of the gases were mixed and set fire to what would be the result mrs b water would equally be formed but there would be a residue of either one or other of the gases because as i have already told you hydrogen and oxygen will combine only in the proportions requisite for the formation of water emily look mrs b our experiment with the voltaic battery plate viii fig 2 has made great progress a quantity of gas has been formed in each tube but in one of them there is twice as much gas as in the other mrs b yes because as i said before water is composed of two volumes of hydrogen to one of oxygenand if we should now mix these gases together and set fire to them by an electrical spark both gases would entirely disappear and a small quantity of water would be formed there is another curious effect produced by the combustion of hydrogen gas which i shall show you though i must acquaint you first that i cannot well explain the cause of it for this purpose i must put some materials into our apparatus in order to obtain a stream of hydrogen gas just as we have done before the process is already going on and the gas is rushing through the tubei shall now kindle it with the taper emily it burns exactly as it did before what is the curious effect which you were mentioning mrs b instead of the receiver by means of which we have just seen the drops of water form we shall invert over the flame this piece of tube which is about two feet in length and one inch in diameter plate viii fig 7 but you must observe that it is open at both ends emily what a strange noise it makes something like the olian harp but not so sweet caroline it is very singular indeed but i think rather too powerful to be pleasing and is not this sound accounted for mrs b that the percussion of glass by a rapid stream of gas should produce a sound is not extraordinary but the sound here is so peculiar that no other gas has a similar effect perhaps it is owing to a brisk vibratory motion of the glass occasioned by the successive formation and condensation of small drops of water on the sides of the glass tube and the air rushing in to replace the vacuum formed footnote this ingenious explanation was first suggested by dr delarive see journals of the royal institution vol i p 259 caroline how very much this flame resembles the burning of a candle mrs b the burning of a candle is produced by much the same means a great deal of hydrogen is contained in candles whether of tallow or wax this hydrogen being converted into gas by the heat of the candle combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere and flame and water result from this combination so that in fact the flame of a candle is owing to the combustion of hydrogen gas an elevation of temperature such as is produced by a lighted match or taper is required to give the first impulse to the combustion but afterwards it goes on of itself because the candle finds a supply of caloric in the successive quantities of heat which results from the union of the two electricities given out by the gases during their combustion but there are other circumstances connected with the combustion of candles and lamps which i cannot explain to you till you are acquainted with carbon which is one of their constituent parts in general however whenever you see flame you may infer that it is owing to the formation and burning of hydrogen gas for flame is the peculiar mode of burning hydrogen gas which with only one or two apparent exceptions does not belong to any other combustible footnote or rather hydrocarbonat a gas composed of hydrogen and carbon which will be noticed under the head carbon emily you astonish me i understood that flame was the caloric produced by the union of the two electricities in all combustions whatever mrs b your error proceeded from your vague and incorrect idea of flame you have confounded it with light and caloric in general flame always implies caloric since it is produced by the combustion of hydrogen gas but all caloric does not imply flame many bodies burn with intense heat without producing flame coals for instance burn with flame until all the hydrogen which they contain is evaporated but when they afterwards become red hot much more caloric is disengaged than when they produce flame caroline but the iron wire which you burnt in oxygen gas appeared to me to emit flame yet as it was a simple metal it could contain no hydrogen mrs b it produced a sparkling dazzling blaze of light but no real flame emily and what is the cause of the regular shape of the flame of a candle mrs b the regular stream of hydrogen gas which exhales from its combustible matter caroline but the hydrogen gas must from its great levity ascend into the upper regions of the atmosphere why therefore does not the flame continue to accompany it mrs b the combustion of the hydrogen gas is completed at the point where the flame terminates it then ceases to be hydrogen gas as it is converted by its combination with oxygen into watery vapour but in a state of such minute division as to be invisible caroline i do not understand what is the use of the wick of a candle since the hydrogen gas burns so well without it mrs b the combustible matter of the candle must be decomposed in order to emit the hydrogen gas and the wick is instrumental in effecting this decomposition its combustion first melts the combustible matter and caroline but in lamps the combustible matter is already fluid and yet they also require wicks mrs b i am going to add that afterwards the burning wick by the power of capillary attraction gradually draws up the fluid to the point where combustion takes place for you must have observed that the wick does not burn quite to the bottom caroline yes but i do not understand why it does not mrs b because the air has not so free an access to that part of the wick which is immediately in contact with the candle as to the part just above so that the heat there is not sufficient to produce its decomposition the combustion therefore begins a little above this point caroline but mrs b in those beautiful lights called gaslights which are now seen in many streets and will i hope be soon adopted every where i can perceive no wick at all how are these lights managed mrs b i am glad you have put me in mind of saying a few words on this very useful and interesting improvement in this mode of lighting the gas is conveyed to the extremity of a tube where it is kindled and burns as long as the supply continues there is therefore no occasion for a wick or any other fuel whatever emily but how is all this gas procured in such large quantities mrs b it is obtained from coal by distillation coal when exposed to heat in a close vessel is decomposed and hydrogen which is one of its constituents rises in the state of gas combined with another of its component parts carbon forming a compound gas called hydrocarbonat the nature of which we shall again have an opportunity of noticing when we treat of carbon this gas like hydrogen is perfectly transparent invisible and highly inflammable and in burning it emits that vivid light which you have so often observed caroline and does the process for procuring it require nothing but heating the coals and conveying the gas through tubes mrs b nothing else except that the gas must be made to pass immediately at its formation through two or three large vessels of water in which it deposits some other ingredients and especially water tar and oil which also arise from the distillation of coals the gaslight apparatus therefore consists simply in a large iron vessel in which the coals are exposed to the heat of a furnacesome reservoirs of water in which the gas deposits its impuritiesand tubes that convey it to the desired spot being propelled with uniform velocity through the tubes by means of a certain degree of pressure which is made upon the reservoir emily what an admirable contrivance do you not think mrs b that it will soon get into universal use mrs b most probably as to the lighting of streets offices and public places as it far surpasses any former invention for that purpose but as to the interior of private houses this mode of lighting has not yet been sufficiently tried to know whether it will be found generally desirable either in regard to economy or convenience it may however be considered as one of the happiest applications of chemistry to the comforts of life and there is every reason to suppose that it will answer the full extent of public expectation i have another experiment to show you with hydrogen gas which i think will entertain you have you ever blown bubbles with soap and water emily yes often when i was a child and i used to make them float in the air by blowing them upwards mrs b we shall fill some such bubbles with hydrogen gas instead of atmospheric air and you will see with what ease and rapidity they will ascend without the assistance of blowing from the lightness of the gas will you mix some soap and water whilst i fill this bladder with the gas contained in the receiver which stands on the shelf in the waterbath caroline what is the use of the brassstopper and turncock at the top of the receiver mrs b it is to afford a passage to the gas when required there is you see a similar stopcock fastened to this bladder which is made to fit that on the receiver i screw them one on the other and now turn the two cocks to open a communication between the receiver and the bladder then by sliding the receiver off the shelf and gently sinking it into the bath the water rises in the receiver and forces the gas into the bladder plate ix fig 1 illustration plate ix vol i p 228 fig 1 apparatus for transferring gases from a receiver into a bladder fig 2 apparatus for blowing soap bubbles caroline yes i see the bladder swell as the water rises in the receiver mrs b i think that we have already a sufficient quantity in the bladder for our purpose we must be careful to stop both the cocks before we separate the bladder from the receiver lest the gas should escape now i must fix a pipe to the stopper of the bladder and by dipping its mouth into the soap and water take up a few dropsthen i again turn the cock and squeeze the bladder in order to force the gas into the soap and water at the mouth of the pipe plate ix fig 2 emily there is a bubblebut it bursts before it leaves the mouth of the pipe mrs b we must have patience and try again it is not so easy to blow bubbles by means of a bladder as simply with the breath caroline perhaps there is not soap enough in the water i should have had warm water it would have dissolved the soap better emily does not some of the gas escape between the bladder and the pipe mrs b no they are perfectly air tight we shall succeed presently i dare say caroline now a bubble ascends it moves with the rapidity of a balloon how beautifully it refracts the light emily it has burst against the ceilingyou succeed now wonderfully but why do they all ascend and burst against the ceiling mrs b hydrogen gas is so much lighter than atmospherical air that it ascends rapidly with its very light envelope which is burst by the force with which it strikes the ceiling airballoons are filled with this gas and if they carried no other weight than their covering would ascend as rapidly as these bubbles caroline yet their covering must be much heavier than that of these bubbles mrs b not in proportion to the quantity of gas they contain i do not know whether you have ever been present at the filling of a large balloon the apparatus for that purpose is very simple it consists of a number of vessels either jars or barrels in which the materials for the formation of the gas are mixed each of these being furnished with a tube and communicating with a long flexible pipe which conveys the gas into the balloon emily but the fireballoons which were first invented and have been since abandoned on account of their being so dangerous were constructed i suppose on a different principle mrs b they were filled simply with atmospherical air considerably rarefied by heat and the necessity of having a fire underneath the balloon in order to preserve the rarefaction of the air within it was the circumstance productive of so much danger if you are not yet tired of experiments i have another to show you it consists in filling soapbubbles with a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases in the proportions that form water and afterwards setting fire to them emily they will detonate i suppose mrs b yes they will as you have seen the method of transferring the gas from the receiver into the bladder it is not necessary to repeat it i have therefore provided a bladder which contains a due proportion of oxygen and hydrogen gases and we have only to blow bubbles with it caroline here is a fine large bubble risingshall i set fire to it with the candle mrs b if you please caroline heavens what an explosion it was like the report of a gun i confess it frightened me much i never should have imagined it could be so loud emily and the flash was as vivid as lightning mrs b the combination of the two gases takes place during that instant of time that you see the flash and hear the detonation emily this has a strong resemblance to thunder and lightning mrs b these phenomena however are generally of an electrical nature yet various meteorological effects may be attributed to accidental detonations of hydrogen gas in the atmosphere for nature abounds with hydrogen it constitutes a very considerable portion of the whole mass of water belonging to our globe and from that source almost every other body obtains it it enters into the composition of all animal substances and of a great number of minerals but it is most abundant in vegetables from this immense variety of bodies it is often spontaneously disengaged its great levity makes it rise into the superior regions of the atmosphere and when either by an electrical spark or any casual elevation of temperature it takes fire it may produce such meteors or luminous appearances as are occasionally seen in the atmosphere of this kind are probably those broad flashes which we often see on a summerevening without hearing any detonation emily every flash i suppose must produce a quantity of water caroline and this water naturally descends in the form of rain mrs b that probably is often the case though it is not a necessary consequence for the water may be dissolved by the atmosphere as it descends towards the lower regions and remain there in the form of clouds the application of electrical attraction to chemical phenomena is likely to lead to many very interesting discoveries in meteorology for electricity evidently acts a most important part in the atmosphere this subject however is as yet not sufficiently developed for me to venture enlarging upon it the phenomena of the atmosphere are far from being well understood and even with the little that is known i am but imperfectly acquainted but before we take leave of hydrogen i must not omit to mention to you a most interesting discovery of sir h davy which is connected with this subject caroline you allude i suppose to the new miners lamp which has of late been so much talked of i have long been desirous of knowing what that discovery was and what purpose it was intended to answer mrs b it often happens in coalmines that quantities of the gas called by chemists hydrocarbonat or by the miners firedamp the same from which the gaslights are obtained ooze out from fissures in the beds of coal and fill the cavities in which the men are at work and this gas being inflammable the consequence is that when the men approach those places with a lighted candle the gas takes fire and explosions happen which destroy the men and horses employed in that part of the colliery sometimes in great numbers emily what tremendous accidents these must be but whence does that gas originate mrs b being the chief product of the combustion of coal no wonder that inflammable gas should occasionally appear in situations in which this mineral abounds since there can be no doubt that processes of combustion are frequently taking place at a great depth under the surface of the earth and therefore those accumulations of gas may arise either from combustions actually going on or from former combustions the gas having perhaps been confined there for ages caroline and how does sir h davys lamp prevent those dreadful explosions mrs b by a contrivance equally simple and ingenious and one which does no less credit to the philosophical views from which it was deduced than to the philanthropic motives from which the enquiry sprung the principle of the lamp is shortly this it was ascertained two or three years ago both by mr tennant and by sir humphry himself that the combustion of inflammable gas could not be propagated through small tubes so that if a jet of an inflammable gaseous mixture issuing from a bladder or any other vessel through a small tube be set fire to it burns at the orifice of the tube but the flame never penetrates into the vessel it is upon this fact that sir humphrys safetylamp is founded emily but why does not the flame ever penetrate through the tube into the vessel from which the gas issues so as to explode at once the whole of the gas mrs b because no doubt the inflamed gas is so much cooled in its passage through a small tube as to cease to burn before the combustion reaches the reservoir caroline and how can this principle be applied to the construction of a lamp mrs b nothing easier you need only suppose a lamp enclosed all round in glass or horn but having a number of small open tubes at the bottom and others at the top to let the air in and out now if such a lamp or lanthorn be carried into an atmosphere capable of exploding an explosion or combustion of the gas will take place within the lamp and although the vent afforded by the tubes will save the lamp from bursting yet from the principle just explained the combustion will not be propagated to the external air through the tubes so that no farther consequence will ensue emily and is that all the mystery of that valuable lamp mrs b no in the early part of the enquiry a lamp of this kind was actually proposed but it was but a rude sketch compared to its present state of improvement sir h davy after a succession of trials by which he brought his lamp nearer and nearer to perfection at last conceived the happy idea that if the lamp were surrounded with a wirework or wiregauze of a close texture instead of glass or horn the tubular contrivance i have just described would be entirely superseded since each of the interstices of the gauze would act as a tube in preventing the propagation of explosions so that this pervious metallic covering would answer the various purposes of transparency of permeability to air and of protection against explosion this idea sir humphry immediately submitted to the test of experiment and the result has answered his most sanguine expectations both in his laboratory and in the collieries where it has already been extensively tried and he has now the happiness of thinking that his invention will probably be the means of saving every year a number of lives which would have been lost in digging out of the bowels of the earth one of the most valuable necessaries of life here is one of these lamps every part of which you will at once comprehend see plate x fig 1 illustration plate x fig 1 a the cistern containing the oil b the rim or screw by which the gauze cage is fixed to the cistern c apperture for supplying oil e a wire for trimming the wick d f the wire gauze cylinder g a double top fig 2 a the reservoir of condensed air b the condensing syringe c the bladder for oxygen d the moveable jet caroline how very simple and ingenious but i do not yet well see why an explosion taking place within the lamp should not communicate to the external air around it through the interstices of the wire mrs b this has been and is still a subject of wonder even to philosophers and the only mode they have of explaining it is that flame or ignition cannot pass through a fine wirework because the metallic wire cools the flame sufficiently to extinguish it in passing through the gauze this property of the wiregauze is quite similar to that of the tubes which i mentioned on introducing the subject for you may consider each interstice of the gauze as an extremely short tube of a very small diameter emily but i should expect the wire would often become redhot by the burning of the gas within the lamp mrs b and this is actually the case for the top of the lamp is very apt to become redhot but fortunately inflammable gaseous mixtures cannot be exploded by redhot wire the intervention of actual flame being required for that purpose so that the wire does not set fire to the explosive gas around it emily i can understand that but if the wire be redhot how can it cool the flame within and prevent its passing through the gauze mrs b the gauze though redhot is not so hot as the flame by which it has been heated and as metallic wire is a good conductor the heat does not much accumulate in it as it passes off quickly to the other parts of the lamp as well as to any contiguous bodies caroline this is indeed a most interesting discovery and one which shows at once the immense utility with which science may be practically applied to some of the most important purposes conversation viii on sulphur and phosphorus mrs b sulphur is the next substance that comes under our consideration it differs in one essential point from the preceding as it exists in a solid form at the temperature of the atmosphere caroline i am glad that we have at last a solid body to examine one that we can see and touch pray is it not with sulphur that the points of matches are covered to make them easily kindle mrs b yes it is and you therefore already know that sulphur is a very combustible substance it is seldom discovered in nature in a pure unmixed state so great is its affinity for other substances that it is almost constantly found combined with some of them it is most commonly united with metals under various forms and is separated from them by a very simple process it exists likewise in many mineral waters and some vegetables yield it in various proportions especially those of the cruciform tribe it is also found in animal matter in short it may be discovered in greater or less quantity in the mineral vegetable and animal kingdoms emily i have heard of flowers of sulphur are they the produce of any plant mrs b by no means they consist of nothing more than common sulphur reduced to a very fine powder by a process called sublimation you see some of it in this phial it is exactly the same substance as this lump of sulphur only its colour is a paler yellow owing to its state of very minute division emily pray what is sublimation mrs b it is the evaporation or more properly speaking the volatilisation of solid substances which in cooling condense again in a concrete form the process in this instance must be performed in a closed vessel both to prevent combustion which would take place if the access of air were not carefully precluded and likewise in order to collect the substance after the operation as it is rather a slow process we shall not try the experiment now but you will understand it perfectly if i show you the apparatus used for the purpose plate xi fig 1 some lumps of sulphur are put into a receiver of this kind which is called a cucurbit its shape you see somewhat resembles that of a pear and is open at the top so as to adapt itself exactly to a kind of conical receiver of this sort called the head the cucurbit thus covered with its head is placed over a sandbath this is nothing more than a vessel full of sand which is kept heated by a furnace such as you see here so as to preserve the apparatus in a moderate and uniform temperature the sulphur then soon begins to melt and immediately after this a thick white smoke rises which is gradually deposited within the head or upper part of the apparatus where it condenses against the sides somewhat in the form of a vegetation whence it has obtained the name of flowers of sulphur this apparatus which is called an alembic is highly useful in all kinds of distillations as you will see when we come to treat of those operations alembics are not commonly made of glass like this which is applicable only to distillations upon a very small scale those used in manufactures are generally made of copper and are of course considerably larger the principal construction however is always the same although their shape admits of some variation illustration plate xi vol i p 237 fig 1 sublimation of sulphur a alembic b sandbath c furnace fig 2 eudiometer fig 3 decomposition of water by carbon a retort containing water b lamp to heat the water cc porcelain tube containing carbone d furnace through which the tube passes e receiver for the gas produced f water bath caroline what is the use of that neck or tube which bends down from the upper piece of the apparatus mrs b it is of no use in sublimations but in distillations the general object of which is to evaporate by heat in closed vessels the volatile parts of a compound body and to condense them again into a liquid it serves to carry off the condensed fluid which otherwise would fall back into the cucurbit but this is rather foreign to our present subject let us return to the sulphur you now perfectly understand i suppose what is meant by sublimation emily i believe i do sublimation appears to consist in destroying by means of heat the attraction of aggregation of the particles of a solid body which are thus volatilised and as soon as they lose the caloric which produced that effect they are deposited in the form of a fine powder caroline it seems to me to be somewhat similar to the transformation of water into vapour which returns to its liquid state when deprived of caloric emily there is this difference however that the sulphur does not return to its former state since instead of lumps it changes to a fine powder mrs b chemically speaking it is exactly the same substance whether in the form of lump or powder for if this powder be melted again by heat it will in cooling be restored to the same solid state in which it was before its sublimation caroline but if there be no real change produced by the sublimation of the sulphur what is the use of that operation mrs b it divides the sulphur into very minute parts and thus disposes it to enter more readily into combination with other bodies it is used also as a means of purification caroline sublimation appears to me like the beginning of combustion for the completion of which one circumstance only is wanting the absorption of oxygen mrs b but that circumstance is every thing no essential alteration is produced in sulphur by sublimation whilst in combustion it combines with the oxygen and forms a new compound totally different in every respect from sulphur in its pure state we shall now burn some sulphur and you will see how very different the result will be for this purpose i put a small quantity of flowers of sulphur into this cup and place it in a dish into which i have poured a little water i now set fire to the sulphur with the point of this hot wire for its combustion will not begin unless its temperature be considerably raised you see that it burns with a faint blueish flame and as i invert over it this receiver white fumes arise from the sulphur and fill the vessel you will soon perceive that the water is rising within the receiver a little above its level in the plate well emily can you account for this emily i suppose that the sulphur has absorbed the oxygen from the atmospherical air within the receiver and that we shall find some oxygenated sulphur in the cup as for the white smoke i am quite at a loss to guess what it may be mrs b your first conjecture is very right but you are mistaken in the last for nothing will be left in the cup the white vapour is the oxygenated sulphur which assumes the form of an elastic fluid of a pungent and offensive smell and is a powerful acid here you see a chemical combination of oxygen and sulphur producing a true gas which would continue such under the pressure and at the temperature of the atmosphere if it did not unite with the water in the plate to which it imparts its acid taste and all its acid properties you see now with what curious effects the combustion of sulphur is attended caroline this is something quite new and i confess that i do not perfectly understand why the sulphur turns acid mrs b it is because it unites with oxygen which is the acidifying principle and indeed the word oxygen is derived from two greek words signifying to produce an acid caroline why then is not water which contains such a quantity of oxygen acid mrs b because hydrogen which is the other constituent of water is not susceptible of acidification i believe it will be necessary before we proceed further to say a few words of the general nature of acids though it is rather a deviation from our plan of examining the simple bodies separately before we consider them in a state of combination acids may be considered as a peculiar class of burnt bodies which during their combustion or combination with oxygen have acquired very characteristic properties they are chiefly discernible by their sour taste and by turning red most of the blue vegetable colours these two properties are common to the whole class of acids but each of them is distinguished by other peculiar qualities every acid consists of some particular substance which constitutes its basis and is different in each and of oxygen which is common to them all emily but i do not clearly see the difference between acids and oxyds mrs b acids were in fact oxyds which by the addition of a sufficient quantity of oxygen have been converted into acids for acidification you must observe always implies previous oxydation as a body must have combined with the quantity of oxygen requisite to constitute it an oxyd before it can combine with the greater quantity that is necessary to render it an acid caroline are all oxyds capable of being converted into acids mrs b very far from it it is only certain substances which will enter into that peculiar kind of union with oxygen that produces acids and the number of these is proportionally very small but all burnt bodies may be considered as belonging either to the class of oxyds or to that of acids at a future period we shall enter more at large into this subject at present i have but one circumstance further to point out to your observation respecting acids it is that most of them are susceptible of two degrees of acidification according to the different quantities of oxygen with which their basis combines emily and how are these two degrees of acidification distinguished mrs b by the peculiar properties which result from them the acid we have just made is the first or weakest degree of acidification and is called sulphureous acid if it were fully saturated with oxygen it would be called sulphuric acid you must therefore remember that in this as in all acids the first degree of acidification is expressed by the termination in ous the stronger by the termination in ic caroline and how is the sulphuric acid made mrs b by burning sulphur in pure oxygen gas and thus rendering its combustion much more complete i have provided some oxygen gas for this purpose it is in that bottle but we must first decant the gas into the glass receiver which stands on the shelf in the bath and is full of water caroline pray let me try to do it mrs b mrs b it requires some little dexterityhold the bottle completely under water and do not turn the mouth upwards till it is immediately under the aperture in the shelf through which the gas is to pass into the receiver and then turn it up gradually very well you have only let a few bubbles escape and that must be expected at a first trial now i shall put this piece of sulphur into the receiver through the opening at the top and introduce along with it a small piece of lighted tinder to set fire to it this requires being done very quickly lest the atmospherical air should get in and mix with the pure oxygen gas emily how beautifully it burns caroline but it is already buried in the thick vapour this i suppose is sulphuric acid emily are these acids always in a gaseous state mrs b sulphureous acid as we have already observed is a permanent gas and can be obtained in a liquid form only by condensing it in water in its pure state the sulphureous acid is invisible and it now appears in the form of a white smoke from its combining with the moisture but the vapour of sulphuric acid which you have just seen to rise during the combustion is not a gas but only a vapour which condenses into liquid sulphuric acid by losing its caloric but it appears from sir h davys experiments that this formation and condensation of sulphuric acid requires the presence of water for which purpose the vapour is received into cold water which may afterwards be separated from the acid by evaporation sulphur has hitherto been considered as a simple substance but sir h davy has suspected that it contains a small portion of hydrogen and perhaps also of oxygen on submitting sulphur to the action of the voltaic battery he observed that the negative wire gave out hydrogen and the existence of hydrogen in sulphur was rendered still more probable by his observing that a small quantity of water was produced during the combustion of sulphur emily and pray of what nature is sulphur when perfectly pure mrs b sulphur has probably never been obtained perfectly free from combination so that its radical may possibly possess properties very different from those of common sulphur it has been suspected to be of a metallic nature but this is mere conjecture before we quit the subject of sulphur i must tell you that it is susceptible of combining with a great variety of substances and especially with hydrogen with which you are already acquainted hydrogen gas can dissolve a small portion of it emily what can a gas dissolve a solid substance mrs b yes a solid substance may be so minutely divided by heat as to become soluble in a gas and there are several instances of it but you must observe that in this case a chemical union or combination of the sulphur with the hydrogen gas is produced in order to effect this the sulphur must be strongly heated in contact with the gas the heat reduces the sulphur to such a state of extreme division and diffuses it so thoroughly through the gas that they combine and incorporate together and as a proof that there must be a chemical union between the sulphur and the gas it is sufficient to remark that they are not separated when the sulphur loses the caloric by which it was volatilized besides it is evident from the peculiar fetid smell of this gas that it is a new compound totally different from either of its constituents it is called sulphuretted hydrogen gas and is contained in great abundance in sulphureous mineral waters caroline are not the harrogate waters of this nature mrs b yes they are naturally impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas and there are many other springs of the same kind which shows that this gas must often be formed in the bowels of the earth by spontaneous processes of nature caroline and could not such waters be made artificially by impregnating common water with this gas mrs b yes they can be so well imitated as perfectly to resemble the harrogate waters sulphur combines likewise with phosphorus and with the alkalies and alkaline earths substances with which you are yet unacquainted we cannot therefore enter into these combinations at present in our next lesson we shall treat of phosphorus emily may we not begin that subject today this lesson has been so short mrs b i have no objection if you are not tired what do you say caroline caroline i am as desirous as emily of prolonging the lesson today especially as we are to enter on a new subject for i confess that sulphur has not appeared to me so interesting as the other simple bodies mrs b perhaps you may find phosphorus more entertaining you must not however be discouraged when you meet with some parts of a study less amusing than others it would answer no good purpose to select the most pleasing parts since if we did not proceed with some method in order to acquire a general idea of the whole we could scarcely expect to take interest in any particular subjects phosphorus phosphorus is considered as a simple body though like sulphur it has been suspected of containing hydrogen it was not known by the earlier chemists it was first discovered by brandt a chemist of hamburgh whilst employed in researches after the philosophers stone but the method of obtaining it remained a secret till it was a second time discovered both by kunckel and boyle in the year 1680 you see a specimen of phosphorus in this phial it is generally moulded into small sticks of a yellowish colour as you find it here caroline i do not understand in what the discovery consisted there may be a secret method of making an artificial composition but how can you talk of making a substance which naturally exists mrs b a body may exist in nature so closely combined with other substances as to elude the observation of chemists or render it extremely difficult to obtain it in its separate state this is the case with phosphorus which is always so intimately combined with other substances that its existence remained unnoticed till brandt discovered the means of obtaining it free from other combinations it is found in all animal substances and is now chiefly extracted from bones by a chemical process it exists also in some plants that bear a strong analogy to animal matter in their chemical composition emily but is it never found in its pure separate state mrs b never and this is the reason that it has remained so long undiscovered phosphorus is eminently combustible it melts and takes fire at the temperature of one hundred degrees and absorbs in its combustion nearly once and a half its own weight of oxygen caroline what will a pound of phosphorus consume a pound and half of oxygen mrs b so it appears from accurate experiments i can show you with what violence it combines with oxygen by burning some of it in that gas we must manage the experiment in the same manner as we did the combustion of sulphur you see i am obliged to cut this little bit of phosphorus under water otherwise there would be danger of its taking fire by the heat of my fingers i now put into the receiver and kindle it by means of a hot wire emily what a blaze i can hardly look at it i never saw any thing so brilliant does it not hurt your eyes caroline caroline yes but still i cannot help looking at it a prodigious quantity of oxygen must indeed be absorbed when so much light and caloric are disengaged mrs b in the combustion of a pound of phosphorus a sufficient quantity of caloric is set free to melt upwards of a hundred pounds of ice this has been computed by direct experiments with the calorimeter emily and is the result of this combustion like that of sulphur an acid mrs b yes phosphoric acid and had we duly proportioned the phosphorus and the oxygen they would have been completely converted into phosphoric acid weighing together in this new state exactly the sum of their weights separately the water would have ascended into the receiver on account of the vacuum formed and would have filled it entirely in this case as in the combustion of sulphur the acid vapour formed is absorbed and condensed in the water of the receiver but when this combustion is performed without any water or moisture being present the acid then appears in the form of concrete whitish flakes which are however extremely ready to melt upon the least admission of moisture emily does phosphorus in burning in atmospherical air produce like sulphur a weaker sort of the same acid mrs b no for it burns in atmospherical air nearly at the same temperature as in pure oxygen gas and it is in both cases so strongly disposed to combine with the oxygen that the combustion is perfect and the product similar only in atmospherical air being less rapidly supplied with oxygen the process is performed in a slower manner caroline but is there no method of acidifying phosphorus in a slighter manner so as to form phosphorus acid mrs b yes there is when simply exposed to the atmosphere phosphorus undergoes a kind of slow combustion at any temperature above zero emily but is not the process in this case rather an oxydation than a combustion for if the oxygen is too slowly absorbed for a sensible quantity of light and heat to be disengaged it is not a true combustion mrs b the case is not as you suppose a faint light is emitted which is very discernible in the dark but the heat evolved is not sufficiently strong to be sensible a whitish vapour arises from this combustion which uniting with water condenses into liquid phosphorus acid caroline is it not very singular that phosphorus should burn at so low a temperature in atmospherical air whilst it does not burn in pure oxygen without the application of heat mrs b so it at first appears but this circumstance seems to be owing to the nitrogen gas of the atmosphere this gas dissolves small particles of phosphorus which being thus minutely divided and diffused in the atmospherical air combines with the oxygen and undergoes this slow combustion but the same effect does not take place in oxygen gas because it is not capable of dissolving phosphorus it is therefore necessary in this case that heat should be applied to effect that division of particles which in the former instance is produced by the nitrogen emily i have seen letters written with phosphorus which are invisible by daylight but may be read in the dark by their own light they look as if they were written with fire yet they do not seem to burn mrs b but they do really burn for it is by their slow combustion that the light is emitted and phosphorus acid is the result of this combustion phosphorus is sometimes used as a test to estimate the purity of atmospherical air for this purpose it is burnt in a graduated tube called an eudiometer plate xi fig 2 and from the quantity of air which the phosphorus absorbs the proportion of oxygen in the air examined is deduced for the phosphorus will absorb all the oxygen and the nitrogen alone will remain emily and the more oxygen is contained in the atmosphere the purer i suppose it is esteemed mrs b certainly phosphorus when melted combines with a great variety of substances with sulphur it forms a compound so extremely combustible that it immediately takes fire on coming in contact with the air it is with this composition that phosphoric matches are prepared which kindle as soon as they are taken out of their case and are exposed to the air emily i have a box of these curious matches but i have observed that in very cold weather they will not take fire without being previously rubbed mrs b by rubbing them you raise their temperature for you know friction is one of the means of extricating heat emily will phosphorus combine with hydrogen gas as sulphur does mrs b yes and the compound gas which results from this combination has a smell still more fetid than the sulphuretted hydrogen it resembles that of garlic the phosphoretted hydrogen gas has this remarkable peculiarity that it takes fire spontaneously in the atmosphere at any temperature it is thus probably that are produced those transient flames or flashes of light called by the vulgar willofthe whisp or more properly ignesfatui which are often seen in churchyards and places where the putrefactions of animal matter exhale phosphorus and hydrogen gas caroline country people who are so much frightened by those appearances would soon be reconciled to them if they knew from what a simple cause they proceed mrs b there are other combinations of phosphorus that have also very singular properties particularly that which results from its union with lime emily is there any name to distinguish the combination of two substances like phosphorus and lime neither of which are oxygen and which cannot therefore produce either an oxyd or an acid mrs b the names of such combinations are composed from those of their ingredients merely by a slight change in their termination thus the combination of sulphur with lime is called a sulphuret and that of phosphorus a phosphuret of lime this latter compound i was going to say has the singular property of decomposing water merely by being thrown into it it effects this by absorbing the oxygen of water in consequence of which bubbles of hydrogen gas ascend holding in solution a small quantity of phosphorus emily these bubbles then are phosphoretted hydrogen gas mrs b yes and they produce the singular appearance of a flash of fire issuing from water as the bubbles kindle and detonate on the surface of the water at the instant that they come in contact with the atmosphere caroline is not this effect nearly similar to that produced by the combination of phosphorus and sulphur or more properly speaking the phosphuret of sulphur mrs b yes but the phenomenon appears more extraordinary in this case from the presence of water and from the gaseous form of the combustible compound besides the experiment surprises by its great simplicity you only throw a piece of phosphoret of lime into a glass of water and bubbles of fire will immediately issue from it caroline cannot we try the experiment mrs b very easily but we must do it in the open air for the smell of the phosphorated hydrogen gas is so extremely fetid that it would be intolerable in the house but before we leave the room we may produce by another process some bubbles of the same gas which are much less offensive there is in this little glass retort a solution of potash in water i add to it a small piece of phosphorus we must now heat the retort over the lamp after having engaged its neck under wateryou see it begins to boil in a few minutes bubbles will appear which take fire and detonate as they issue from the water caroline there is oneand another how curious it is but i do not understand how this is produced mrs b it is the consequence of a display of affinities too complicated i fear to be made perfectly intelligible to you at present in a few words the reciprocal action of the potash phosphorus caloric and water are such that some of the water is decomposed and the hydrogen gas thereby formed carries off some minute particles of phosphorus with which it forms phosphoretted hydrogen gas a compound which spontaneously takes fire at almost any temperature emily what is that circular ring of smoke which slowly rises from each bubble after its detonation mrs b it consists of water and phosphoric acid in vapour which are produced by the combustion of hydrogen and phosphorus conversation ix on carbon caroline today mrs b i believe we are to learn the nature and properties of carbon this substance is quite new to me i never heard it mentioned before mrs b not so new as you imagine for carbon is nothing more than charcoal in a state of purity that is to say unmixed with any foreign ingredients caroline but charcoal is made by art mrs b and a body consisting of one simple substance cannot be fabricated mrs b you again confound the idea of making a simple body with that of separating it from a compound the chemical processes by which a simple body is obtained in a state of purity consist in unmaking the compound in which it is contained in order to separate from it the simple substance in question the method by which charcoal is usually obtained is indeed commonly called making it but upon examination you will find this process to consist simply in separating it from other substances with which it is found combined in nature carbon forms a considerable part of the solid matter of all organised bodies but it is most abundant in the vegetable creation and it is chiefly obtained from wood when the oil and water which are other constituents of vegetable matter are evaporated the black porous brittle substance that remains is charcoal caroline but if heat be applied to the wood in order to evaporate the oil and water will not the temperature of the charcoal be raised so as to make it burn and if it combines with oxygen can we any longer call it pure mrs b i was going to say that in this operation the air must be excluded caroline how then can the vapour of the oil and water fly off mrs b in order to produce charcoal in its purest state which is even then but a less imperfect sort of carbon the operation should be performed in an earthen retort heat being applied to the body of the retort the evaporable part of the wood will escape through its neck into which no air can penetrate as long as the heated vapour continues to fill it and if it be wished to collect these volatile products of the wood this can easily be done by introducing the neck of the retort into the waterbath apparatus with which you are acquainted but the preparation of common charcoal such as is used in kitchens and manufactures is performed on a much larger scale and by an easier and less expensive process emily i have seen the process of making common charcoal the wood is ranged on the ground in a pile of a pyramidical form with a fire underneath the whole is then covered with clay a few holes only being left for the circulation of air mrs b these holes are closed as soon as the wood is fairly lighted so that the combustion is checked or at least continues but in a very imperfect manner but the heat produced by it is sufficient to force out and volatilize through the earthy cover most part of the oily and watery principles of the wood although it cannot reduce it to ashes emily is pure carbon as black as charcoal mrs b the purest charcoal we can prepare is so but chemists have never yet been able to separate it entirely from hydrogen sir h davy says that the most perfect carbon that is prepared by art contains about five per cent of hydrogen he is of opinion that if we could obtain it quite free from foreign ingredients it would be metallic in common with other simple substances but there is a form in which charcoal appears that i dare say will surprise you this ring which i wear on my finger owes its brilliancy to a small piece of carbon caroline surely you are jesting mrs b emily i thought your ring was diamond mrs b it is so but diamond is nothing more than carbon in a crystallized state emily that is astonishing is it possible to see two things apparently more different than diamond and charcoal caroline it is indeed curious to think that we adorn ourselves with jewels of charcoal mrs b there are many other substances consisting chiefly of carbon that are remarkably white cotton for instance is almost wholly carbon caroline that i own i could never have imagined but pray mrs b since it is known of what substance diamond and cotton are composed why should they not be manufactured or imitated by some chemical process which would render them much cheaper and more plentiful than the present mode of obtaining them mrs b you might as well my dear propose that we should make flowers and fruit nay perhaps even animals by a chemical process for it is known of what these bodies consist since every thing which we are acquainted with in nature is formed from the various simple substances that we have enumerated but you must not suppose that a knowledge of the component parts of a body will in every case enable us to imitate it it is much less difficult to decompose bodies and discover of what materials they are made than it is to recompose them the first of these processes is called analysis the last synthesis when we are able to ascertain the nature of a substance by both these methods so that the result of one confirms that of the other we obtain the most complete knowledge of it that we are capable of acquiring this is the case with water with the atmosphere with most of the oxyds acids and neutral salts and with many other compounds but the more complicated combinations of nature even in the mineral kingdom are in general beyond our reach and any attempt to imitate organised bodies must ever prove fruitless their formation is a secret that rests in the bosom of the creator you see therefore how vain it would be to attempt to make cotton by chemical means but surely we have no reason to regret our inability in this instance when nature has so clearly pointed out a method of obtaining it in perfection and abundance caroline i did not imagine that the principle of life could be imitated by the aid of chemistry but it did not appear to me ridiculous to suppose that chemists might attain a perfect imitation of inanimate nature mrs b they have succeeded in this point in a variety of instances but as you justly observe the principle of life or even the minute and intimate organisation of the vegetable kingdom are secrets that have almost entirely eluded the researches of philosophers nor do i imagine that human art will ever be capable of investigating them with complete success emily but diamond since it consists of one simple unorganised substance might be one would think perfectly imitable by art mrs b it is sometimes as much beyond our power to obtain a simple body in a state of perfect purity as it is to imitate a complicated combination for the operations by which nature separates bodies are frequently as inimitable as those which she uses for their combination this is the case with carbon all the efforts of chemists to separate it entirely from other substances have been fruitless and in the purest state in which it can be obtained by art it still retains a portion of hydrogen and probably of some other foreign ingredients we are ignorant of the means which nature employs to crystallize it it may probably be the work of ages to purify arrange and unite the particles of carbon in the form of diamond here is some charcoal in the purest state we can procure it you see that it is a very black brittle light porous substance entirely destitute of either taste or smell heat without air produces no alteration in it as it is not volatile but on the contrary it invariably remains at the bottom of the vessel after all the other parts of the vegetable are evaporated emily yet carbon is no doubt combustible since you say that charcoal would absorb oxygen if air were admitted during its preparation caroline unquestionably besides you know emily how much it is used in cooking but pray what is the reason that charcoal burns without smoke whilst a wood fire smokes so much mrs b because in the conversion of wood into charcoal the volatile particles of the former have been evaporated caroline yet i have frequently seen charcoal burn with flame therefore it must in that case contain some hydrogen mrs b very true but you must recollect that charcoal especially that which is used for common purposes is not perfectly pure it generally retains some remains of the various other component parts of vegetables and hydrogen particularly which accounts for the flame in question caroline but what becomes of the carbon itself during its combustion mrs b it gradually combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere in the same way as sulphur and phosphorus and like those substances it is converted into a peculiar acid which flies off in a gaseous form there is this difference however that the acid is not in this instance as in the two cases just mentioned a mere condensable vapour but a permanent elastic fluid which always remains in the state of gas under any pressure and at any temperature the nature of this acid was first ascertained by dr black of edinburgh and before the introduction of the new nomenclature it was called fixed air it is now distinguished by the more appropriate name of carbonic acid gas emily carbon then can be volatilized by burning though by heat alone no such effect is produced mrs b yes but then it is no longer simple carbon but an acid of which carbon forms the basis in this state carbon retains no more appearance of solidity or corporeal form than the basis of any other gas and you may i think from this instance derive a more clear idea of the basis of the oxygen hydrogen and nitrogen gases the existence of which as real bodies you seemed to doubt because they were not to be obtained simply in a solid form emily that is true we may conceive the basis of the oxygen and of the other gases to be solid heavy substances like carbon but so much expanded by caloric as to become invisible caroline but does not the carbonic acid gas partake of the blackness of charcoal mrs b not in the least blackness you know does not appear to be essential to carbon and it is pure carbon and not charcoal that we must consider as the basis of carbonic acid we shall make some carbonic acid and in order to hasten the process we shall burn the carbon in oxygen gas emily but do you mean then to burn diamond mrs b charcoal will answer the purpose still better being softer and more easy to inflame besides the experiments on diamond are rather expensive caroline but is it possible to burn diamond mrs b yes it is and in order to effect this combustion nothing more is required than to apply a sufficient degree of heat by means of the blowpipe and of a stream of oxygen gas indeed it is by burning diamond that its chemical nature has been ascertained it has long been known as a combustible substance but it is within these few years only that the product of its combustion has been proved to be pure carbonic acid this remarkable discovery is due to mr tennant now let us try to make some carbonic acid will you emily decant some oxygen gas from this large jar into the receiver in which we are to burn the carbon and i shall introduce this small piece of charcoal with a little lighted tinder which will be necessary to give the first impulse to the combustion emily i cannot conceive how so small a piece of tinder and that but just lighted can raise the temperature of the carbon sufficiently to set fire to it for it can produce scarcely any sensible heat and it hardly touches the carbon mrs b the tinder thus kindled has only heat enough to begin its own combustion which however soon becomes so rapid in the oxygen gas as to raise the temperature of the charcoal sufficiently for this to burn likewise as you see is now the case emily i am surprised that the combustion of carbon is not more brilliant it does not give out near so much light or caloric as phosphorus or sulphur yet since it combines with so much oxygen why is not a proportional quantity of light and heat disengaged from the decomposition of the oxygen gas and the union of its electricity with that of the charcoal mrs b it is not surprising that less light and heat should be liberated in this than in almost any other combustion since the oxygen instead of entering into a solid or liquid combination as it does in the phosphoric and sulphuric acids is employed in forming another elastic fluid it therefore parts with less of its caloric emily true and on second consideration it appears on the contrary surprising that the oxygen should in its combination with carbon retain a sufficient portion of caloric to maintain both substances in a gaseous state caroline we may then judge of the degree of solidity in which oxygen is combined in a burnt body by the quantity of caloric liberated during its combustion mrs b yes provided that you take into the account the quantity of oxygen absorbed by the combustible body and observe the proportion which the caloric bears to it caroline but why should the water after the combustion of carbon rise in the receiver since the gas within it retains an ariform state mrs b because the carbonic acid gas is gradually absorbed by the water and this effect would be promoted by shaking the receiver emily the charcoal is now extinguished though it is not nearly consumed it has such an extraordinary avidity for oxygen i suppose that the receiver did not contain enough to satisfy the whole mrs b that is certainly the case for if the combustion were performed in the exact proportions of 28 parts of carbon to 72 of oxygen both these ingredients would disappear and 100 parts of carbonic acid would be produced caroline carbonic acid must be a very strong acid since it contains so great a proportion of oxygen mrs b that is a very natural inference yet it is erroneous for the carbonic is the weakest of all the acids the strength of an acid seems to depend upon the nature of its basis and its mode of combination as well as upon the proportion of the acidifying principle the same quantity of oxygen that will convert some bodies into strong acids will only be sufficient simply to oxydate others caroline since this acid is so weak i think chemists should have called it the carbonous instead of the carbonic acid emily but i suppose the carbonous acid is still weaker and is formed by burning carbon in atmospherical air mrs b it has been lately discovered that carbon may be converted into a gas by uniting with a smaller proportion of oxygen but as this gas does not possess any acid properties it is no more than an oxyd it is called gaseous oxyd of carbon caroline pray is not carbonic acid a very wholesome gas to breathe as it contains so much oxygen mrs b on the contrary it is extremely pernicious oxygen when in a state of combination with other substances loses in almost every instance its respirable properties and the salubrious effects which it has on the animal economy when in its unconfined state carbonic acid is not only unfit for respiration but extremely deleterious if taken into the lungs emily you know caroline how very unwholesome the fumes of burning charcoal are reckoned caroline yes but to confess the truth i did not consider that a charcoal fire produced carbonic acid gas can this gas be condensed into a liquid mrs b no for as i told you before it is a permanent elastic fluid but water can absorb a certain quantity of this gas and can even be impregnated with it in a very strong degree by the assistance of agitation and pressure as i am going to show you i shall decant some carbonic acid gas into this bottle which i fill first with water in order to exclude the atmospherical air the gas is then introduced through the water which you see it displaces for it will not mix with it in any quantity unless strongly agitated or allowed to stand over it for some time the bottle is now about half full of carbonic acid gas and the other half is still occupied by the water by corking the bottle and then violently shaking it in this way i can mix the gas and water together now will you taste it emily it has a distinct acid taste caroline yes it is sensibly sour and appears full of little bubbles mrs b it possesses likewise all the other properties of acids but of course in a less degree than the pure carbonic acid gas as it is so much diluted by water this is a kind of artificial seltzer water by analysing that which is produced by nature it was found to contain scarcely any thing more than common water impregnated with a certain proportion of carbonic acid gas we are therefore able to imitate it by mixing those proportions of water and carbonic acid here my dear is an instance in which by a chemical process we can exactly copy the operations of nature for the artificial seltzer waters can be made in every respect similar to those of nature in one point indeed the former have an advantage since they may be prepared stronger or weaker as occasion requires caroline i thought i had tasted such water before but what renders it so brisk and sparkling mrs b this sparkling or effervescence as it is called is always occasioned by the action of an elastic fluid escaping from a liquid in the artifical seltzer water it is produced by the carbonic acid which being lighter than the water in which it was strongly condensed flies off with great rapidity the instant the bottle is uncorked this makes it necessary to drink it immediately the bubbling that took place in this bottle was but trifling as the water was but very slightly impregnated with carbonic acid it requires a particular apparatus to prepare the gaseous artificial mineral waters emily if then a bottle of seltzer water remains for any length of time uncorked i suppose it returns to the state of common water mrs b the whole of the carbonic acid gas or very nearly so will soon disappear but there is likewise in seltzer water a very small quantity of soda and of a few other saline or earthy ingredients which will remain in the water though it should be kept uncorked for any length of time caroline i have often heard of people drinking sodawater pray what sort of water is that mrs b it is a kind of artificial seltzer water holding in solution besides the gaseous acid a particular saline substance called soda which imparts to the water certain medicinal qualities caroline but how can these waters be so wholesome since carbonic acid is so pernicious mrs b a gas we may conceive though very prejudicial to breathe may be beneficial to the stomach but it would be of no use to attempt explaining this more fully at present caroline are waters never impregnated with other gases mrs b yes there are several kinds of gaseous waters i forgot to tell you that waters have for some years past been prepared impregnated both with oxygen and hydrogen gases these are not an imitation of nature but are altogether obtained by artificial means they have been lately used medicinally particularly on the continent where i understand they have acquired some reputation emily if i recollect right mrs b you told us that carbon was capable of decomposing water the affinity between oxygen and carbon must therefore be greater than between oxygen and hydrogen mrs b yes but this is not the case unless their temperature be raised to a certain degree it is only when carbon is redhot that it is capable of separating the oxygen from the hydrogen thus if a small quantity of water be thrown on a redhot fire it will increase rather than extinguish the combustion for the coals or wood both of which contain a quantity of carbon decompose the water and thus supply the fire both with oxygen and hydrogen gases if on the contrary a large mass of water be thrown over the fire the diminution of heat thus produced is such that the combustible matter loses the power of decomposing the water and the fire is extinguished emily i have heard that fireengines sometimes do more harm than good and that they actually increase the fire when they cannot throw water enough to extinguish it it must be owing no doubt to the decomposition of the water by the carbon during the conflagration mrs b certainly the apparatus which you see here plate xi fig 3 may be used to exemplify what we have just said it consists in a kind of open furnace through which a porcelain tube containing charcoal passes to one end of the tube is adapted a glass retort with water in it and the other end communicates with a receiver placed on the waterbath a lamp being applied to the retort and the water made to boil the vapour is gradually conveyed through the redhot charcoal by which it is decomposed and the hydrogen gas which results from this decomposition is collected in the receiver but the hydrogen thus obtained is far from being pure it retains in solution a minute portion of carbon and contains also a quantity of carbonic acid this renders it heavier than pure hydrogen gas and gives it some peculiar properties it is distinguished by the name of carbonated hydrogen gas caroline and whence does it obtain the carbonic acid that is mixed with it emily i believe i can answer that question caroline from the union of the oxygen proceeding from the decomposed water with the carbon which you know makes carbonic acid caroline true i should have recollected that the product of the decomposition of water by redhot charcoal therefore is carbonated hydrogen gas and carbonic acid gas mrs b you are perfectly right now carbon is frequently found combined with hydrogen in a state of solidity especially in coals which owe their combustible nature to these two principles emily is it the hydrogen then that produces the flame of coals mrs b it is so and when all the hydrogen is consumed the carbon continues to burn without flame but again as i mentioned when speaking of the gaslights the hydrogen gas produced by the burning of coals is not pure for during the combustion particles of carbon are successively volatilized with the hydrogen with which they form what is called a hydrocarbonat which is the principal product of this combustion carbon is a very bad conductor of heat for this reason it is employed in conjunction with other ingredients for coating furnaces and other chemical apparatus emily pray what is the use of coating furnaces mrs b in most cases in which a furnace is used it is necessary to produce and preserve a great degree of heat for which purpose every possible means are used to prevent the heat from escaping by communicating with other bodies and this object is attained by coating over the inside of the furnace with a kind of plaster composed of materials that are bad conductors of heat carbon combined with a small quantity of iron forms a compound called plumbago or blacklead of which pencils are made this substance agreeably to the nomenclature is a carburet of iron emily why then is it called blacklead mrs b it is an ancient name given to it by ignorant people from its shining metallic appearance but it is certainly a most improper name for it as there is not a particle of lead in the composition there is only one mine of this mineral which is in cumberland it is supposed to approach as nearly to pure carbon as the best prepared charcoal does as it contains only five parts of iron unadulterated by any other foreign ingredients there is another carburet of iron in which the iron though united only to an extremely small proportion of carbon acquires very remarkable properties this is steel caroline really and yet steel is much harder than iron mrs b but carbon is not ductile like iron and therefore may render the steel more brittle and prevent its bending so easily whether it is that the carbon by introducing itself into the pores of the iron and by filling them makes the metal both harder and heavier or whether this change depends upon some chemical cause i cannot pretend to decide but there is a subsequent operation by which the hardness of steel is very much increased which simply consists in heating the steel till it is redhot and then plunging it into cold water carbon besides the combination just mentioned enters into the composition of a vast number of natural productions such for instance as all the various kinds of oils which result from the combination of carbon hydrogen and caloric in various proportions emily i thought that carbon hydrogen and caloric formed carbonated hydrogen gas mrs b that is the case when a small portion of carbonic acid gas is held in solution by hydrogen gas different proportions of the same principles together with the circumstances of their union produce very different combinations of this you will see innumerable examples besides we are not now talking of gases but of carbon and hydrogen combined only with a quantity of caloric sufficient to bring them to the consistency of oil or fat caroline but oil and fat are not of the same consistence mrs b fat is only congealed oil or oil melted fat the one requires a little more heat to maintain it in a fluid state than the other have you never observed the fat of meat turned to oil by the caloric it has imbibed from the fire emily yet oils in general as saladoil and lampoil do not turn to fat when cold mrs b not at the common temperature of the atmosphere because they retain too much caloric to congeal at that temperature but if exposed to a sufficient degree of cold their latent heat is extricated and they become solid fat substances have you never seen salad oil frozen in winter emily yes but it appears to me in that state very different from animal fat mrs b the essential constituent parts of either vegetable or animal oils are the same carbon and hydrogen their variety arises from the different proportions of these substances and from other accessory ingredients that may be mixed with them the oil of a whale and the oil of roses are in their essential constituent parts the same but the one is impregnated with the offensive particles of animal matter the other with the delicate perfume of a flower the difference of fixed oils and volatile or essential oils consists also in the various proportions of carbon and hydrogen fixed oils are those which will not evaporate without being decomposed this is the case with all common oils which contain a greater proportion of carbon than the essential oils the essential oils which comprehend the whole class of essences and perfumes are lighter they contain more equal proportions of carbon and hydrogen and are volatilized or evaporated without being decomposed emily when you say that one kind of oil will evaporate and the other be decomposed you mean i suppose by the application of heat mrs b not necessarily for there are oils that will evaporate slowly at the common temperature of the atmosphere but for a more rapid volatilization or for their decomposition the assistance of heat is required caroline i shall now remember i think that fat and oil are really the same substances both consisting of carbon and hydrogen that in fixed oils the carbon preponderates and heat produces a decomposition while in essential oils the proportion of hydrogen is greater and heat produces a volatilization only emily i suppose the reason why oil burns so well in lamps is because its two constituents are so combustible mrs b certainly the combustion of oil is just the same as that of a candle if tallow it is only oil in a concrete state if wax or spermaceti its chief chemical ingredients are still hydrogen and carbon emily i wonder then there should be so great a difference between tallow and wax mrs b i must again repeat that the same substances in different proportions produce results that have sometimes scarcely any resemblance to each other but this is rather a general remark that i wish to impress upon your minds than one which is applicable to the present case for tallow and wax are far from being very dissimilar the chief difference consists in the wax being a purer compound of carbon and hydrogen than the tallow which retains more of the gross particles of animal matter the combustion of a candle and that of a lamp both produce water and carbonic acid gas can you tell me how these are formed emily let me reflect both the candle and lamp burn by means of fixed oilthis is decomposed as the combustion goes on and the constituent parts of the oil being thus separated the carbon unites to a portion of oxygen from the atmosphere to form carbonic acid gas whilst the hydrogen combines with another portion of oxygen and forms with it water the products therefore of the combustion of oils are water and carbonic acid gas caroline but we see neither water nor carbonic acid produced by the combustion of a candle mrs b the carbonic acid gas you know is invisible and the water being in a state of vapour is so likewise emily is perfectly correct in her explanation and i am very much pleased with it all the vegetable acids consist of various proportions of carbon and hydrogen acidified by oxygen gums sugar and starch are likewise composed of these ingredients but as the oxygen which they contain is not sufficient to convert them into acids they are classed with the oxyds and called vegetable oxyds caroline i am very much delighted with all these new ideas but at the same time i cannot help being apprehensive that i may forget many of them mrs b i would advise you to take notes or what would answer better still to write down after every lesson as much of it as you can recollect and in order to give you a little assistance i shall lend you the heads or index which i occasionally consult for the sake of preserving some method and arrangement in these conversations unless you follow some such plan you cannot expect to retain nearly all that you learn how great soever be the impression it may make on you at first emily i will certainly follow your advice hitherto i have found that i recollected pretty well what you have taught us but the history of carbon is a more extensive subject than any of the simple bodies we have yet examined mrs b i have little more to say on carbon at present but hereafter you will see that it performs a considerable part in most chemical operations caroline that is i suppose owing to its entering into the composition of so great a variety of substances mrs b certainly it is the basis you have seen of all vegetable matter and you will find that it is very essential to the process of animalization but in the mineral kingdom also particularly in its form of carbonic acid we shall often discover it combined with a great variety of substances in chemical operations carbon is particularly useful from its very great attraction for oxygen as it will absorb this substance from many oxygenated or burnt bodies and thus deoxygenate or unburn them and restore them to their original combustible state caroline i do not understand how a body can be unburnt and restored to its original state this piece of tinder for instance that has been burnt if by any means the oxygen were extracted from it would not be restored to its former state of linen for its texture is destroyed by burning and that must be the case with all organized or manufactured substances as you observed in a former conversation mrs b a compound body is decomposed by combustion in a way which generally precludes the possibility of restoring it to its former state the oxygen for instance does not become fixed in the tinder but it combines with its volatile parts and flies off in the shape of gas or watery vapour you see therefore how vain it would be to attempt the recomposition of such bodies but with regard to simple bodies or at least bodies whose component parts are not disturbed by the process of oxygenation or deoxygenation it is often possible to restore them after combustion to their original state the metals for instance undergo no other alteration by combustion than a combination with oxygen therefore when the oxygen is taken from them they return to their pure metallic state but i shall say nothing further of this at present as the metals will furnish ample subject for another morning and they are the class of simple bodies that come next under consideration conversation x on metals mrs b the metals which we are now to examine are bodies of a very different nature from those which we have hitherto considered they do not like the bases of gases elude the immediate observation of our senses for they are the most brilliant the most ponderous and the most palpable substances in nature caroline i doubt however whether the metals will appear to us so interesting and give us so much entertainment as those mysterious elements which conceal themselves from our view besides they cannot afford so much novelty they are bodies with which we are already so well acquainted mrs b you are not aware my dear of the interesting discoveries which were a few years ago made by sir h davy respecting this class of bodies by the aid of the voltaic battery he has obtained from a variety of substances metals before unknown the properties of which are equally new and curious we shall begin however by noticing those metals with which you profess to be so well acquainted but the acquaintance you will soon perceive is but very superficial and i trust that you will find both novelty and entertainment in considering the metals in a chemical point of view to treat of this subject fully would require a whole course of lectures for metals form of themselves a most important branch of practical chemistry we must therefore confine ourselves to a general view of them these bodies are seldom found naturally in their metallic form they are generally more or less oxygenated or combined with sulphur earths or acids and are often blended with each other they are found buried in the bowels of the earth in most parts of the world but chiefly in mountainous districts where the surface of the globe has suffered from the earthquakes volcanos and other convulsions of nature they are spread in strata or beds called veins and these veins are composed of a certain quantity of metal combined with various earthy substances with which they form minerals of different nature and appearance which are called ores caroline i now feel quite at home for my father has a leadmine in yorkshire and i have heard a great deal about veins of ore and of the roasting and smelting of the lead but i confess that i do not understand in what these operations consist mrs b roasting is the process by which the volatile parts of the ore are evaporated smelting that by which the pure metal is afterwards separated from the earthy remains of the ore this is done by throwing the whole into a furnace and mixing with it certain substances that will combine with the earthy parts and other foreign ingredients of the ore the metal being the heaviest falls to the bottom and runs out by proper openings in its pure metallic state emily you told us in a preceding lesson that metals had a great affinity for oxygen do they not therefore combine with oxygen when strongly heated in the furnace and run out in the state of oxyds mrs b no for the scori or oxyd which soon forms on the surface of the fused metal when it is oxydable prevents the air from having any further influence on the mass so that neither combustion nor oxygenation can take place caroline are all the metals equally combustible mrs b no their attraction for oxygen varies extremely there are some that will combine with it only at a very high temperature or by the assistance of acids whilst there are others that oxydate spontaneously and with great rapidity even at the lowest temperature such is in particular manganese which scarcely ever exists in the metallic state as it immediately absorbs oxygen on being exposed to the air and crumbles to an oxyd in the course of a few hours emily is not that the oxyd from which you extracted the oxygen gas mrs b it is so that you see this metal attracts oxygen at a low temperature and parts with it when strongly heated emily is there any other metal that oxydates at the temperature of the atmosphere mrs b they all do more or less excepting gold silver and platina copper lead and iron oxydate slowly in the air and cover themselves with a sort of rust a process which depends on the gradual conversion of the surface into an oxyd this rusty surface preserves the interior metal from oxydation as it prevents the air from coming in contact with it strictly speaking however the word rust applies only to the oxyd which forms on the surface of iron when exposed to air and moisture which oxyd appears to be united with a small portion of carbonic acid emily when metals oxydate from the atmosphere without an elevation of temperature some light and heat i suppose must be disengaged though not in sufficient quantities to be sensible mrs b undoubtedly and indeed it is not surprising that in this case the light and heat should not be sensible when you consider how extremely slow and indeed how imperfectly most metals oxydate by mere exposure to the atmosphere for the quantity of oxygen with which metals are capable of combining generally depends upon their temperature and the absorption stops at various points of oxydation according to the degree to which their temperature is raised emily that seems very natural for the greater the quantity of caloric introduced into a metal the more will its positive electricity be exalted and consequently the stronger will be its affinity for oxygen mrs b certainly when the metal oxygenates with sufficient rapidity for light and heat to become sensible combustion actually takes place but this happens only at very high temperatures and the product is nevertheless an oxyd for though as i have just said metals will combine with different proportions of oxygen yet with the exception of only five of them they are not susceptible of acidification metals change colour during the different degrees of oxydation which they undergo lead when heated in contact with the atmosphere first becomes grey if its temperature be then raised it turns yellow and a still stronger heat changes it to red iron becomes successively a green brown and white oxyd copper changes from brown to blue and lastly green emily pray is the white lead with which houses are painted prepared by oxydating lead mrs b not merely by oxydating but by being also united with carbonic acid it is a carbonat of lead the mere oxyd of lead is called red lead litharge is another oxyd of lead containing less oxygen almost all the metallic oxyds are used as paints the various sorts of ochres consist chiefly of iron more or less oxydated and it is a remarkable circumstance that if you burn metals rapidly the light or flame they emit during combustion partakes of the colours which the oxyd successively assumes caroline how is that accounted for mrs b for light you know does not proceed from the burning body but from the decomposition of the oxygen gas mrs b the correspondence of the colour of the light with that of the oxyd which emits it is in all probability owing to some particles of the metal which are volatilised and carried off by the caloric caroline it is then a sort of metallic gas emily why is it reckoned so unwholesome to breathe the air of a place in which metals are melting mrs b perhaps the notion is too generally entertained but it is true with respect to lead and some other noxious metals because unless care be taken the particles of the oxyd which are volatilised by the heat are inhaled in with the breath and may produce dangerous effects i must show you some instances of the combustion of metals it would require the heat of a furnace to make them burn in the common air but if we supply them with a stream of oxygen gas we may easily accomplish it caroline but it will still i suppose be necessary in some degree to raise their temperature mrs b this as you shall see is very easily done particularly if the experiment be tried upon a small scale i begin by lighting this piece of charcoal with the candle and then increase the rapidity of its combustion by blowing upon it with a blowpipe plate xii fig 1 illustration plate xii apparatus for the combustion of metals by means of oxygen gas fig 1 igniting charcoal with a taper blowpipe fig 2 combustion of metals by means of a blowpipe conveying a stream of oxygen gas from a gas holder emily that i do not understand for it is not every kind of air but merely oxygen gas that produces combustion now you said that in breathing we inspired but did not expire oxygen gas why therefore should the air which you breathe through the blowpipe promote the combustion of the charcoal mrs b because the air which has but once passed through the lungs is yet but little altered a small portion only of its oxygen being destroyed so that a great deal more is gained by increasing the rapidity of the current by means of the blowpipe than is lost in consequence of the air passing once through the lungs as you shall see emily yes indeed it makes the charcoal burn much brighter mrs b whilst it is redhot i shall drop some iron filings on it and supply them with a current of oxygen gas by means of this apparatus plate xii fig 2 which consists simply of a closed tin cylindrical vessel full of oxygen gas with two apertures and stopcocks by one of which a stream of water is thrown into the vessel through a long funnel whilst by the other the gas is forced out through a blowpipe adapted to it as the water gains admittance now that i pour water into the funnel you may hear the gas issuing from the blowpipei bring the charcoal close to the current and drop the filings upon it caroline they emit much the same vivid light as the combustion of the iron wire in oxygen gas mrs b the process is in fact the same there is only some difference in the mode of conducting it let us burn some tin in the same manneryou see that it is equally combustible let us now try some copper caroline this burns with a greenish flame it is i suppose owing to the colour of the oxyd emily pray shall we not also burn some gold mrs b that is not in our power at least in this way gold silver and platina are incapable of being oxydated by the greatest heat that we can produce by the common method it is from this circumstance that they have been called perfect metals even these however have an affinity for oxygen but their oxydation or combustion can be performed only by means of acids or by electricity the spark given out by the voltaic battery produces at the point of contact a greater degree of heat than any other process and it is at this very high temperature only that the affinity of these metals for oxygen will enable them to act on each other i am sorry that i cannot show you the combustion of the perfect metals by this process but it requires a considerable voltaic battery you will see these experiments performed in the most perfect manner when you attend the chemical lectures of the royal institution but in the mean time i can without difficulty show you an ingenious apparatus lately contrived for the purpose of producing intense heats the power of which nearly equals that of the largest voltaic batteries it simply consists you see in a strong box made of iron or copper plate x fig 2 to which may be adapted this airsyringe or condensingpump and a stopcock terminating in a small orifice similar to that of a blowpipe by working the condensing syringe up and down in this manner a quantity of air is accumulated in the vessel which may be increased to almost any extent so that if we now turn the stopcock the condensed air will rush out forming a jet of considerable force and if we place the flame of a lamp in the current you will see how violently the flame is driven in that direction caroline it seems to be exactly the same effect as that of a blowpipe worked by the mouth only much stronger emily yes and this new instrument has this additional advantage that it does not fatigue the mouth and lungs like the common blowpipe and requires no art in blowing mrs b unquestionably but yet this blowpipe would be of very limited utility if its energy and power could not be greatly increased by some other contrivance can you imagine any mode of producing such an effect emily could not the reservoir be charged with pure oxygen instead of common air as in the case of the gasholder mrs b undoubtedly and this is precisely the contrivance i allude to the vessel need only be supplied with air from a bladder full of oxygen instead of the air of the room and this you see may be easily done by screwing the bladder on the upper part of the syringe so that in working the syringe the oxygen gas is forced from the bladder into the condensing vessel caroline with the aid of this small apparatus therefore we could obtain the same effects as those we have just produced with the gasholder by means of a column of water forcing the gas out of it mrs b yes and much more conveniently so but there is a mode of using this apparatus by which more powerful effects still may be obtained it consists in condensing in the reservoir not oxygen alone but a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen in the exact proportion in which they unite to produce water and then kindling the jet formed by the mixed gases the heat disengaged by this combustion without the help of any lamp is probably the most intense known and various effects are said to have been obtained from it which exceed all expectation caroline but why should we not try this experiment mrs b because it is not exempt from danger the combustion notwithstanding various contrivances which have been resorted to with a view to prevent accident being apt to penetrate into the inside of the vessel and to produce a dangerous and violent explosion we shall therefore now proceed in our subject caroline i think you said the oxyds of metals could be restored to their metallic state mrs b yes this is called reviving a metal metals are in general capable of being revived by charcoal when heated red hot charcoal having a greater attraction for oxygen than the metals you need only therefore decompose or unburn the oxyd by depriving it of its oxygen and the metal will be restored to its pure state emily but will the carbon by this operation be burnt and be converted into carbonic acid mrs b certainly there are other combustible substances to which metals at a high temperature will part with their oxygen they will also yield it to each other according to their several degrees of attraction for it and if the oxygen goes into a more dense state in the metal which it enters than it existed in that which it quits a proportional disengagement of caloric will take place caroline and cannot the oxyds of gold silver and platina which are formed by means of acids or of the electric fluid be restored to their metallic state mrs b yes they may and the intervention of a combustible body is not required heat alone will take the oxygen from them convert it into a gas and revive the metal emily you said that rust was an oxyd of iron how is it then that water or merely dampness produces it which you know it very frequently does on steel grates or any iron instruments mrs b in that case the metal decomposes the water or dampness which is nothing but water in a state of vapour and obtains the oxygen from it caroline i thought that it was necessary to bring metals to a very high temperature to enable them to decompose water mrs b it is so if it is required that the process should be performed rapidly and if any considerable quantity is to be decomposed rust you knew is sometimes months in forming and then it is only the surface of the metal that is oxydated emily metals then that do not rust are incapable of spontaneous oxydation either by air or water mrs b yes and this is the case with the perfect metals which on that account preserve their metallic lustre so well emily are all metals capable of decomposing water provided their temperature be sufficiently raised mrs b no a certain degree of attraction is requisite besides the assistance of heat water you recollect is composed of oxygen and hydrogen and unless the affinity of the metal for oxygen be stronger than that of hydrogen it is in vain that we raise its temperature for it cannot take the oxygen from the hydrogen iron zinc tin and antimony have a stronger affinity for oxygen than hydrogen has therefore these four metals are capable of decomposing water but hydrogen having an advantage over all the other metals with respect to its affinity for oxygen it not only withholds its oxygen from them but is even capable under certain circumstances of taking the oxygen from the oxyds of these metals emily i confess that i do not quite understand why hydrogen can take oxygen from those metals that do not decompose water caroline now i think i do perfectly lead for instance will not decompose water because it has not so strong an attraction for oxygen as hydrogen has well then suppose the lead to be in a state of oxyd hydrogen will take the oxygen from the lead and unite with it to form water because hydrogen has a stronger attraction for oxygen than oxygen has for lead and it is the same with all the other metals which do not decompose water emily i understand your explanation caroline very well and i imagine that it is because lead cannot decompose water that it is so much employed for pipes for conveying that fluid mrs b certainly lead is on that account particularly appropriate to such purposes whilst on the contrary this metal if it was oxydable by water would impart to it very noxious qualities as all oxyds of lead are more or less pernicious but with regard to the oxydation of metals the most powerful mode of effecting it is by means of acids these you know contain a much greater proportion of oxygen than either air or water and will most of them easily yield it to metals thus you recollect the zinc plates of the voltaic battery are oxydated by the acid and water much more effectually than by water alone caroline and i have often observed that if i drop vinegar lemon or any acid on the blade of a knife or on a pair of scissars it will immediately produce a spot of rust emily metals have then three ways of obtaining oxygen from the atmosphere from water and from acids mrs b the two first you have already witnessed and i shall now show you how metals take the oxygen from an acid this bottle contains nitric acid i shall pour some of it over this piece of copperleaf caroline oh what a disagreeable smell emily and what is it that produces the effervescency and that thick yellow vapour mrs b it is the acid which being abandoned by the greatest part of its oxygen is converted into a weaker acid which escapes in the form of gas caroline and whence proceeds this heat mrs b indeed caroline i think you might now be able to answer that question yourself caroline perhaps it is that the oxygen enters into the metal in a more solid state than it existed in the acid in consequence of which caloric is disengaged mrs b if the combination of the oxygen and the metal results from the union of their opposite electricities of course caloric must be given out emily the effervescence is over therefore i suppose that the metal is now oxydated mrs b yes but there is another important connection between metals and acids with which i must now make you acquainted metals when in the state of oxyds are capable of being dissolved by acids in this operation they enter into a chemical combination with the acid and form an entirely new compound caroline but what difference is there between the oxydation and the dissolution of the metal by an acid mrs b in the first case the metal merely combines with a portion of oxygen taken from the acid which is thus partly deoxygenated as in the instance you have just seen in the second case the metal after being previously oxydated is actually dissolved in the acid and enters into a chemical combination with it without producing any further decomposition or effervescence this complete combination of an oxyd and an acid forms a peculiar and important class of compound salts emily the difference between an oxyd and a compound salt therefore is very obvious the one consists of a metal and oxygen the other of an oxyd and an acid mrs b very well and you will be careful to remember that the metals are incapable of entering into this combination with acids unless they are previously oxydated therefore whenever you bring a metal in contact with an acid it will be first oxydated and afterwards dissolved provided that there be a sufficient quantity of acid for both operations there are some metals however whose solution is more easily accomplished by diluting the acid in water and the metal will in this case be oxydated not by the acid but by the water which it will decompose but in proportion as the oxygen of the water oxydates the surface of the metal the acid combines with it washes it off and leaves a fresh surface for the oxygen to act upon then other coats of oxyd are successively formed and rapidly dissolved by the acid which continues combining with the newformed surfaces of oxyd till the whole of the metal is dissolved during this process the hydrogen gas of the water is disengaged and flies off with effervescence emily was not this the manner in which the sulphuric acid assisted the iron filings in decomposing water mrs b exactly and it is thus that several metals which are incapable alone of decomposing water are enabled to do it by the assistance of an acid which by continually washing off the covering of oxyd as it is formed prepares a fresh surface of metal to act upon the water caroline the acid here seems to act a part not very different from that of a scrubbingbrush but pray would not this be a good method of cleaning metallic utensils mrs b yes on some occasions a weak acid as vinegar is used for cleaning copper iron plates too are freed from the rust on their surface by diluted muriatic acid previous to their being covered with tin you must remember however that in this mode of cleaning metals the acid should be quickly afterwards wiped off otherwise it would produce fresh oxyd caroline let us watch the dissolution of the copper in the nitric acid for i am very impatient to see the salt that is to result from it the mixture is now of a beautiful blue colour but there is no appearance of the formation of a salt it seems to be a tedious operation mrs b the crystallisation of the salt requires some length of time to be completed if however you are so impatient i can easily show you a metallic salt already formed caroline but that would not satisfy my curiosity half so well as one of our own manufacturing mrs b it is one of our own preparing that i mean to show you when we decomposed water a few days since by the oxydation of iron filings through the assistance of sulphuric acid in what did the process consist caroline in proportion as the water yielded its oxygen to the iron the acid combined with the newformed oxyd and the hydrogen escaped alone mrs b very well the result therefore was a compound salt formed by the combination of sulphuric acid with oxyd of iron it still remains in the vessel in which the experiment was performed fetch it and we shall examine it emily what a variety of processes the decomposition of water by a metal and an acid implies 1st the decomposition of the water 2dly the oxydation of the metal and 3dly the formation of a compound salt caroline here it is mrs b what beautiful green crystals but we do not perceive any crystals in the solution of copper in nitrous acid mrs b because the salt is now suspended in the water which the nitrous acid contains and will remain so till it is deposited in consequence of rest and cooling emily i am surprised that a body so opake as iron can be converted into such transparent crystals mrs b it is the union with the acid that produces the transparency for if the pure metal were melted and afterwards permitted to cool and crystallise it would be found just as opake as before emily i do not understand the exact meaning of crystallisation mrs b you recollect that when a solid body is dissolved either by water or caloric it is not decomposed but that its integrant parts are only suspended in the solvent when the solution is made in water the integrant particles of the body will on the water being evaporated again unite into a solid mass by the force of their mutual attraction but when the body is dissolved by caloric alone nothing more is necessary in order to make its particles reunite than to reduce its temperature and in general if the solvent whether water or caloric be slowly separated by evaporation or by cooling and care taken that the particles be not agitated during their reunion they will arrange themselves in regular masses each individual substance assuming a peculiar form or arrangement and this is what is called crystallisation emily crystallisation therefore is simply the reunion of the particles of a solid body that has been dissolved in a fluid mrs b that is a very good definition of it but i must not forget to observe that heat and water may unite their solvent powers and in this case crystallisation may be hastened by cooling as well as by evaporating the liquid caroline but if the body dissolved is of a volatile nature will it not evaporate with the fluid mrs b a crystallised body held in solution only by water is scarcely ever so volatile as the fluid itself and care must be taken to manage the heat so that it may be sufficient to evaporate the water only i should not omit also to mention that bodies in crystallising from their watery solution always retain a small portion of water which remains confined in the crystal in a solid form and does not reappear unless the body loses its crystalline state this is called the water of crystallisation but you must observe that whilst a body may be separated from its solution in water or caloric simply by cooling or by evaporation an acid can be taken from a metal with which it is combined only by stronger affinities which produce a decomposition emily are the perfect metals susceptible of being dissolved and converted into compound salts by acids mrs b gold is acted upon by only one acid the oxygenated muriatic a very remarkable acid which when in its most concentrated state dissolves gold or any other metal by burning them rapidly gold can it is true be dissolved likewise by a mixture of two acids commonly called aqua regia but this mixed solvent derives that property from containing the peculiar acid which i have just mentioned platina is also acted upon by this acid only silver is dissolved by nitric acid caroline i think you said that some of the metals might be so strongly oxydated as to become acid mrs b there are five metals arsenic molybdena chrome tungsten and columbium which are susceptible of combining with a sufficient quantity of oxygen to be converted into acids caroline acids are connected with metals in such a variety of ways that i am afraid of some confusion in remembering them in the first place acids will yield their oxygen to metals secondly they will combine with them in their state of oxyds to form compound salts and lastly several of the metals are themselves susceptible of acidification mrs b very well but though metals have so great an affinity for acids it is not with that class of bodies alone that they will combine they are most of them in their simple state capable of uniting with sulphur with phosphorus with carbon and with each other these combinations according to the nomenclature which was explained to you on a former occasion are called sulphurets phosphorets carburets c the metallic phosphorets offer nothing very remarkable the sulphurets form the peculiar kind of mineral called pyrites from which certain kinds of mineral waters as those of harrogate derive their chief chemical properties in this combination the sulphur together with the iron have so strong an attraction for oxygen that they obtain it both from the air and from water and by condensing it in a solid form produce the heat which raises the temperature of the water in such a remarkable degree emily but if pyrites obtain oxygen from water that water must suffer a decomposition and hydrogen gas be evolved mrs b that is actually the case in the hot springs alluded to which give out an extremely fetid gas composed of hydrogen impregnated with sulphur caroline if i recollect right steel and plumbago which you mentioned in the last lesson are both carburets of iron mrs b yes and they are the only carburets of much consequence a curious combination of metals has lately very much attracted the attention of the scientific world i mean the meteoric stones that fall from the atmosphere they consist principally of native or pure iron which is never found in that state in the bowels of the earth and contain also a small quantity of nickel and chrome a combination likewise new in the mineral kingdom these circumstances have led many scientific persons to believe that those substances have fallen from the moon or some other planet while others are of opinion either that they are formed in the atmosphere or are projected into it by some unknown volcano on the surface of our globe caroline i have heard much of these stones but i believe many people are of opinion that they are formed on the surface of the earth and laugh at their pretended celestial origin mrs b the fact of their falling is so well ascertained that i think no person who has at all investigated the subject can now entertain any doubt of it specimens of these stones have been discovered in all parts of the world and to each of them some tradition or story of its fall has been found connected and as the analysis of all those specimens affords precisely the same results there is strong reason to conjecture that they all proceed from the same source it is to mr howard that philosophers are indebted for having first analysed these stones and directed their attention to this interesting subject caroline but pray mrs b how can solid masses of iron and nickel be formed from the atmosphere which consists of the two airs nitrogen and oxygen mrs b i really do not see how they could and think it much more probable that they fall from the moon but we must not suffer this digression to take up too much of our time the combinations of metals with each other are called alloys thus brass is an alloy of copper and zinc bronze of copper and tin c emily and is not pewter also a combination of metal mrs b it is the pewter made in this country is mostly composed of tin with a very small proportion of zinc and lead caroline blocktin is a kind of pewter i believe mrs b properly speaking blocktin means tin in blocks or square massive ingots but in the sense in which it is used by ignorant workmen it is iron plated with tin which renders it more durable as tin will not so easily rust tin alone however would be too soft a metal to be worked for common use and all tinvessels and utensils are in fact made of plates of iron thinly coated with tin which prevents the iron from rusting caroline say rather oxydating mrs b rust is a word that should be exploded in chemistry mrs b take care however not to introduce the word oxydate instead of rust in general conversation for you would probably not be understood and you might be suspected of affectation metals differ very much in their affinity for each other some will not unite at all others readily combine together and on this property of metals the art of soldering depends emily what is soldering mrs b it is joining two pieces of metal together by a more fusible metal interposed between them thus tin is a solder for lead brass gold or silver are solder for iron c caroline and is not plating metals something of the same nature mrs b in the operation of plating two metals are united one being covered with the other but without the intervention of a third iron or copper may thus be covered with gold or silver emily mercury appears to me of a very different nature from the other metals mrs b one of its greatest peculiarities is that it retains a fluid state at the temperature of the atmosphere all metals are fusible at different degrees of heat and they have likewise each the property of freezing or becoming solid at a certain fixed temperature mercury congeals only at seventytwo degrees below the freezing point emily that is to say that in order to freeze it requires a temperature of seventytwo degrees colder than that at which water freezes mrs b exactly so caroline but is the temperature of the atmosphere ever so low as that mrs b yes often in siberia but happily never in this part of the globe here however mercury may be congealed by artificial cold i mean such intense cold as can be produced by some chemical mixtures or by the rapid evaporation of ether under the airpump footnote by a process analogous to that described page 155 of this volume caroline and can mercury be made to boil and evaporate mrs b yes like any other liquid only it requires a much greater degree of heat at the temperature of six hundred degrees it begins to boil and evaporate like water mercury combines with gold silver tin and with several other metals and if mixed with any of them in a sufficient proportion it penetrates the solid metal softens it loses its own fluidity and forms an amalgam which is the name given to the combination of any metal with mercury forming a substance more or less solid according as the mercury or the other metal predominates emily in the list of metals there are some whose names i have never before heard mentioned mrs b besides those which sir h davy has obtained there are several that have been recently discovered whose properties are yet but little known as for instance titanium which was discovered by the rev mr gregor in the tinmines of cornwall columbium or tantalium which has lately been discovered by mr hatchett and osmium iridium palladium and rhodium all of which dr wollaston and mr tennant found mixed in minute quantities with crude platina and the distinct existence of which they proved by curious and delicate experiments caroline arsenic has been mentioned amongst the metals i had no notion that it belonged to that class of bodies for i had never seen it but as a powder and never thought of it but as a most deadly poison mrs b in its pure metallic state i believe it is not so poisonous but it has such a great affinity for oxygen that it absorbs it from the atmosphere at its natural temperature you have seen it therefore only in its state of oxyd when from its combination with oxygen it has acquired its very poisonous properties caroline is it possible that oxygen can impart poisonous qualities that valuable substance which produces light and fire and which all bodies in nature are so eager to obtain mrs b most of the metallic oxyds are poisonous and derive this property from their union with oxygen the white lead so much used in paint owes its pernicious effects to oxygen in general oxygen in a concrete state appears to be particularly destructive in its effects on flesh or any animal matter and those oxyds are most caustic that have an acrid burning taste which proceeds from the metal having but a slight affinity for oxygen and therefore easily yielding it to the flesh which it corrodes and destroys emily what is the meaning of the word caustic which you have just used mrs b it expresses that property which some bodies possess of disorganizing and destroying animal matter by operating a kind of combustion or at least a chemical decomposition you must often have heard of caustic used to burn warts or other animal excrescences most of these bodies owe their destructive power to the oxygen with which they are combined the common caustic called lunar caustic is a compound formed by the union of nitric acid and silver and it is supposed to owe its caustic qualities to the oxygen contained in the nitric acid caroline but pray are not acids still more caustic than oxyds as they contain a greater proportion of oxygen mrs b some of the acids are but the caustic property of a body depends not only upon the quantity of oxygen which it contains but also upon its slight affinity for that principle and the consequent facility with which it yields it emily is not this destructive property of oxygen accounted for mrs b it proceeds probably from the strong attraction of oxygen for hydrogen for if the one rapidly absorb the other from the animal fibre a disorganisation of the substance must ensue emily caustics are then very properly said to burn the flesh since the combination of oxygen and hydrogen is an actual combustion caroline now i think this effect would be more properly termed an oxydation as there is no disengagement of light and heat mrs b but there really is a sensation of heat produced by the action of caustics emily if oxygen is so caustic why does not that which is contained in the atmosphere burn us mrs b because it is in a gaseous state and has a greater attraction for its electricity than for the hydrogen of our bodies besides should the air be slightly caustic we are in a great measure sheltered from its effects by the skin you know how much a wound however trifling smarts on being exposed to it caroline it is a curious idea however that we should live in a slow fire but if the air was caustic would it not have an acrid taste mrs b it possibly may have such a taste though in so slight a degree that custom has rendered it insensible caroline and why is not water caustic when i dip my hand into water though cold it ought to burn me from the caustic nature of its oxygen mrs b your hand does not decompose the water the oxygen in that state is much better supplied with hydrogen than it would be by animal matter and if its causticity depend on its affinity for that principle it will be very far from quitting its state of water to act upon your hand you must not forget that oxyds are caustic in proportion as the oxygen adheres slightly to them emily since the oxyd of arsenic is poisonous its acid i suppose is fully as much so mrs b yes it is one of the strongest poisons in nature emily there is a poison called verdigris which forms on brass and copper when not kept very clean and this i have heard is an objection to these metals being made into kitchen utensils is this poison likewise occasioned by oxygen mrs b it is produced by the intervention of oxygen for verdigris is a compound salt formed by the union of vinegar and copper it is of a beautiful green colour and much used in painting emily but i believe verdigris is often formed on copper when no vinegar has been in contact with it mrs b not real verdigris but compound salts somewhat resembling it may be produced by the action of any acid on copper the solution of copper in nitric acid if evaporated affords a salt which produces an effect on tin that will surprise you and i have prepared some from the solution we made before that i might show it to you i shall first sprinkle some water on this piece of tinfoil and then some of the salt now observe that i fold it up suddenly and press it into one lump caroline what a prodigious vapour issues from itand sparks of fire i declare mrs b i thought it would surprise you the effect however i dare say you could account for since it is merely the consequence of the oxygen of the salt rapidly entering into a closer combination with the tin there is also a beautiful green salt too curious to be omitted it is produced by the combination of cobalt with muriatic acid which has the singular property of forming what is called sympathetic ink characters written with this solution are invisible when cold but when a gentle heat is applied they assume a fine bluish green colour caroline i think one might draw very curious landscapes with the assistance of this ink i would first make a watercolour drawing of a winterscene in which the trees should be leafless and the grass scarcely green i would then trace all the verdure with the invisible ink and whenever i chose to create spring i should hold it before the fire and its warmth would cover the landscape with a rich verdure mrs b that will be a very amusing experiment and i advise you by all means to try it transcribers note several cobalt compounds including the cobalt chloride described here are still in use as invisible sympathetic inks they are safe if used appropriately before we part i must introduce to your acquaintance the curious metals which sir h davy has recently discovered the history of these extraordinary bodies is yet so much in its infancy that i shall confine myself to a very short account of them it is more important to point out to you the vast and apparently inexhaustible field of research which has been thrown open to our view by sir h davys memorable discoveries than to enter into a minute account of particular bodies or experiments caroline but i have heard that these discoveries however splendid and extraordinary are not very likely to prove of any great benefit to the world as they are rather objects of curiosity than of use mrs b such may be the illiberal conclusions of the ignorant and narrowminded but those who can duly estimate the advantages of enlarging the sphere of science must be convinced that the acquisition of every new fact however unconnected it may at first appear with practical utility must ultimately prove beneficial to mankind but these remarks are scarcely applicable to the present subject for some of the new metals have already proved eminently useful as chemical agents and are likely soon to be employed in the arts for the enumeration of these metals i must refer you to our list of simple bodies they are derived from the alkalies the earths and three of the acids all of which had been hitherto considered as undecompoundable or simple bodies when sir h davy first turned his attention to the effects of the voltaic battery he tried its power on a variety of compound bodies and gradually brought to light a number of new and interesting facts which led the way to more important discoveries it would be highly interesting to trace his steps in this new department of science but it would lead us too far from our principal object a general view of his most remarkable discoveries is all that i can aim at or that you could at present understand the facility with which compound bodies yielded to the voltaic electricity induced him to make trial of its effects on substances hitherto considered as simple but which he suspected of being compound and his researches were soon crowned with the most complete success the body which he first submitted to the voltaic battery and which had never yet been decomposed was one of the fixed alkalies called potash this substance gave out an elastic fluid at the positive wire which was ascertained to be oxygen and at the negative wire small globules of a very high metallic lustre very similar in appearance to mercury thus proving that potash which had hitherto been considered as a simple incombustible body was in fact a metallic oxyd and that its incombustibility proceeded from its being already combined with oxygen emily i suppose the wires used in this experiment were of platina as they were when you decomposed water for if of iron the oxygen would have combined with the wire instead of appearing in the form of gas mrs b certainly the metal however would equally have been disengaged sir h davy has distinguished this new substance by the name of potassium which is derived from that of the alkali from which it is procured i have some small pieces of it in this phial but you have already seen it as it is the metal which we burnt in contact with sulphur emily what is the liquid in which you keep it mrs b it is naptha a bituminous liquid with which i shall hereafter make you acquainted it is almost the only fluid in which potassium can be preserved as it contains no oxygen and this metal has so powerful an attraction for oxygen that it will not only absorb it from the air but likewise from water or any body whatever that contains it emily this then is one of the bodies that oxydates spontaneously without the application of heat mrs b yes and it has this remarkable peculiarity that it attracts oxygen much more rapidly from water than from air so that when thrown into water however cold it actually bursts into flame i shall now throw a small piece about the size of a pins head on this drop of water caroline it instantaneously exploded producing a little flash of light this is indeed a most curious substance mrs b by its combustion it is reconverted into potash and as potash is now decidedly a compound body i shall not enter into any of its properties till we have completed our review of the simple bodies but we may here make a few observations on its basis potassium if this substance is left in contact with air it rapidly returns to the state of potash with a disengagement of heat but without any flash of light emily but is it not very singular that it should burn better in water than in air caroline i do not think so for if the attraction of potassium for oxygen is so strong that it finds no more difficulty in separating it from the hydrogen in water than in absorbing it from the air it will no doubt be more amply and rapidly supplied by water than by air mrs b that cannot however be precisely the reason for when potassium is introduced under water without contact of air the combustion is not so rapid and indeed in that case there is no luminous appearance but a violent action takes place much heat is excited the potash is regenerated and hydrogen gas is evolved potassium is so eminently combustible that instead of requiring like other metals an elevation of temperature it will burn rapidly in contact with water even below the freezing point this you may witness by throwing a piece on this lump of ice caroline it again exploded with flame and has made a deep hole in the ice mrs b this hole contains a solution of potash for the alkali being extremely soluble disappears in the water at the instant it is produced its presence however may be easily ascertained alkalies having the property of changing paper stained with turmeric to a red colour if you dip one end of this slip of paper into the hole in the ice you will see it change colour and the same if you wet it with the drop of water in which the first piece of potassium was burnt caroline it has indeed changed the paper from yellow to red mrs b this metal will burn likewise in carbonic acid gas a gas that had always been supposed incapable of supporting combustion as we were unacquainted with any substance that had a greater attraction for oxygen than carbon potassium however readily decomposes this gas by absorbing its oxygen as i shall show you this retort is filled with carbonic acid gas i will put a small piece of potassium in it but for this combustion a slight elevation of temperature is required for which purpose i shall hold the retort over the lamp caroline now it has taken fire and burns with violence it has burst the retort mrs b here is the piece of regenerated potash can you tell me why it is become so black emily no doubt it is blackened by the carbon which when its oxygen entered into combination with the potassium was deposited on its surface mrs b you are right this metal is perfectly fluid at the temperature of one hundred degrees at fifty degrees it is solid but soft and malleable at thirtytwo degrees it is hard and brittle and its fracture exhibits an appearance of confused crystallization it is scarcely more than half as heavy as water its specific gravity being about six when water is reckoned at ten so that this metal is actually lighter than any known fluid even than ether potassium combines with sulphur and phosphorus forming sulphurets and phosphurets it likewise forms alloys with several metals and amalgamates with mercury emily but can a sufficient quantity of potassium be obtained by means of the voltaic battery to admit of all its properties and relations to other bodies being satisfactorily ascertained mrs b not easily but i must not neglect to inform you that a method of obtaining this metal in considerable quantities has since been discovered two eminent french chemists thenard and gay lussac stimulated by the triumph which sir h davy had obtained attempted to separate potassium from its combination with oxygen by common chemical means and without the aid of electricity they caused red hot potash in a state of fusion to filter through iron turnings in an iron tube heated to whiteness their experiment was crowned with the most complete success more potassium was obtained by this single operation that could have been collected in many weeks by the most diligent use of the voltaic battery emily in this experiment i suppose the oxygen quitted its combination with the potassium to unite with the iron turnings mrs b exactly so and the potassium was thus obtained in its simple state from that time it has become a most convenient and powerful instrument of deoxygenation in chemical experiments this important improvement engrafted on sir h davys previous discoveries served but to add to his glory since the facts which he had established when possessed of only a few atoms of this curious substance and the accuracy of his analytical statements were all confirmed when an opportunity occurred of repeating his experiments upon this substance which can now be obtained in unlimited quantities caroline what a satisfaction sir h davy must have felt when by an effort of genius he succeeded in bringing to light and actually giving existence to these curious bodies which without him might perhaps have ever remained concealed from our view mrs b the next substance which sir h davy submitted to the influence of the voltaic battery was soda the other fixed alkali which yielded to the same powers of decomposition from this alkali too a metallic substance was obtained very analogous in its properties to that which had been discovered in potash sir h davy has called it sodium it is rather heavier than potassium though considerably lighter than water it is not so easily fusible as potassium encouraged by these extraordinary results sir h davy next performed a series of beautiful experiments on ammonia or the volatile alkali which from analogy he was led to suspect might also contain oxygen this he soon ascertained to be the fact but he has not yet succeeded in obtaining the basis of ammonia in a separate state it is from analogy and from the power which the volatile alkali has in its gaseous form to oxydate iron and also from the amalgams which can be obtained from ammonia by various processes that the proofs of that alkali being also a metallic oxyd are deduced thus then the three alkalies two of which had always been considered as simple bodies have now lost all claim to that title and i have accordingly classed the alkalies amongst the compounds whose properties we shall treat of in a future conversation emily what are the other newly discovered metals which you have alluded to in your list of simple bodies mrs b they are the metals of the earths which became next the object of sir h davys researches these bodies had never yet been decomposed though they were strongly suspected not only of being compounds but of being metallic oxyds from the circumstance of their incombustibility it was conjectured with some plausibility that they might possibly be bodies that had been already burnt caroline and metals when oxydated become to all appearance a kind of earthy substance mrs b they have besides several features of resemblance with metallic oxyds sir h davy had therefore great reason to be sanguine in his expectations of decomposing them and he was not disappointed he could not however succeed in obtaining the basis of the earths in a pure separate state but metallic alloys were formed with other metals which sufficiently proved the existence of the metallic basis of the earths the last class of new metallic bodies which sir h davy discovered was obtained from the three undecompounded acids the boracic the fluoric and the muriatic acids but as you are entirely unacquainted with these bodies i shall reserve the account of their decomposition till we come to treat of their properties as acids thus in the course of two years by the unparalleled exertions of a single individual chemical science has assumed a new aspect bodies have been brought to light which the human eye never before beheld and which might have remained eternally concealed under their impenetrable disguise it is impossible at the present period to appreciate to their full extent the consequences which science or the arts may derive from these discoveries we may however anticipate the most important results in chemical analysis we are now in possession of more energetic agents of decomposition than were ever before known in geology new views are opened which will probably operate a revolution in that obscure and difficult science it is already proved that all the earths and in fact the solid surface of this globe are metallic bodies mineralized by oxygen and as our planet has been calculated to be considerably more dense upon the whole than on the surface it is reasonable to suppose that the interior part is composed of a metallic mass the surface of which only has been mineralized by the atmosphere the eruptions of volcanos those stupendous problems of nature admit now of an easy explanation for if the bowels of the earth are the grand recess of these newly discovered inflammable bodies whenever water penetrates into them combustions and explosions must take place and it is remarkable that the lava which is thrown out is the very kind of substance which might be expected to result from these combustions i must now take my leave of you we have had a very long conversation today and i hope you will be able to recollect what you have learnt at our next interview we shall enter on a new subject end of the first volume printed by a strahan printersstreet london conversations on chemistry in which the elements of that science are familiarly explained and illustrated by experiments in two volumes the fifth edition revised corrected and considerably enlarged vol ii on compound bodies london printed for longman hurst rees orme and brown paternosterrow 1817 conversation xiii on the attraction of composition mrs b having completed our examination of the simple or elementary bodies we are now to proceed to those of a compound nature but before we enter on this extensive subject it will be necessary to make you acquainted with the principal laws by which chemical combinations are governed you recollect i hope what we formerly said of the nature of the attraction of composition or chemical attraction or affinity as it is also called emily yes i think perfectly it is the attraction that subsists between bodies of a different nature which occasions them to combine and form a compound when they come in contact and according to sir h davys opinion this effect is produced by the attraction of the opposite electricities which prevail in bodies of different kinds mrs b very well your definition comprehends the first law of chemical attraction which is that it takes place only between bodies of a different nature as for instance between an acid and an alkali between oxygen and a metal c caroline that we understand of course for the attraction between particles of a similar nature is that of aggregation or cohesion which is independent of any chemical power mrs b the 2d law of chemical attraction is that it takes place only between the most minute particles of bodies therefore the more you divide the particles of the bodies to be combined the more readily they act upon each other caroline that is again a circumstance which we might have supposed for the finer the particles of the two substances are the more easily and perfectly they will come in contact with each other which must greatly facilitate their union it was for this purpose you said that you used iron filings in preference to wires or pieces of iron for the decomposition of water mrs b it was once supposed that no mechanical power could divide bodies into particles sufficiently minute for them to act on each other and that in order to produce the extreme division requisite for a chemical action one if not both of the bodies should be in a fluid state there are however a few instances in which two solid bodies very finely pulverized exert a chemical action on one another but such exceptions to the general rule are very rare indeed emily in all the combinations that we have hitherto seen one of the constituents has i believe been either liquid or ariform in combustions for instance the oxygen is taken from the atmosphere in which it existed in the state of gas and whenever we have seen acids combine with metals or with alkalies they were either in a liquid or an ariform state mrs b the 3d law of chemical attraction is that it can take place between two three four or even a greater number of bodies caroline oxyds and acids are bodies composed of two constituents but i recollect no instance of the combination of a greater number of principles mrs b the compound salts formed by the union of the metals with acids are composed of three principles and there are salts formed by the combination of the alkalies with the earths which are of a similar description caroline are they of the same kind as the metallic salts mrs b yes they are very analogous in their nature although different in many of their properties a methodical nomenclature similar to that of the acids has been adopted for the compound salts each individual salt derives its name from its constituent parts so that every name implies a knowledge of the composition of the salt the three alkalies the alkaline earths and the metals are called salifiable bases or radicals and the acids salifying principles the name of each salt is composed both of that of the acid and the salifiable base and it terminates in at or it according to the degree of the oxygenation of the acid thus for instance all those salts which are formed by the combination of the sulphuric acid with any of the salifiable bases are called sulphats and the name of the radical is added for the specific distinction of the salt if it be potash it will compose a sulphat of potash if ammonia sulphat of ammonia c emily the crystals which we obtained from the combination of iron and sulphuric acid were therefore sulphat of iron mrs b precisely and those which we prepared by dissolving copper in nitric acid nitrat of copper and so on but this is not all if the salt be formed by that class of acids which ends in ous which you know indicates a less degree of oxygenation the termination of the name of the salt will be in it as sulphit of potash sulphit of ammonia c emily there must be an immense number of compound salts since there is so great a variety of salifiable radicals as well as of salifying principles mrs b their real number cannot be ascertained since it increases every day but we must not proceed further in the investigation of the compound salts until we have completed the examination of the nature of the ingredients of which they are composed the 4th law of chemical attraction is that a change of temperature always takes place at the moment of combination this arises from the extrication of the two electricities in the form of caloric which takes place when bodies unite and also sometimes in part from a change of capacity of the bodies for heat which always takes place when the combination is attended with an increase of density but more especially when the compound passes from the liquid to the solid form i shall now show you a striking instance of a change of temperature from chemical union merely by pouring some nitrous acid on this small quantity of oil of turpentinethe oil will instantly combine with the oxygen of the acid and produce a considerable change of temperature caroline what a blaze the temperature of the oil and the acid must be greatly raised indeed to produce such a violent combustion mrs b there is however a peculiarity in this combustion which is that the oxygen instead of being derived from the atmosphere alone is principally supplied by the acid itself emily and are not all combustions instances of the change of temperature produced by the chemical combination of two bodies mrs b undoubtedly when oxygen loses its gaseous form in order to combine with a solid body it becomes condensed and the caloric evolved produces the elevation of temperature the specific gravity of bodies is at the same time altered by chemical combination for in consequence of a change of capacity for heat a change of density must be produced caroline that was the case with the sulphuric acid and water which by being mixed together gave out a great deal of heat and increased in density mrs b the 5th law of chemical attraction is that the properties which characterise bodies when separate are altered or destroyed by their combination caroline certainly what for instance can be so different from water as the hydrogen and oxygen gases emily or what more unlike sulphat of iron than iron or sulphuric acid mrs b every chemical combination is an illustration of this rule but let us proceed the 6th law is that the force of chemical affinity between the constituents of a body is estimated by that which is required for their separation this force is not always proportional to the facility with which bodies unite for manganese for instance which you know is so much disposed to unite with oxygen that it is never found in a metallic state yields it more easily than any other metal emily but mrs b you speak of estimating the force of attraction between bodies by the force required to separate them how can you measure these forces mrs b they cannot be precisely measured but they are comparatively ascertained by experiment and can be represented by numbers which express the relative degrees of attraction the 7th law is that bodies have amongst themselves different degrees of attraction upon this law which you may have discovered yourselves long since the whole science of chemistry depends for it is by means of the various degrees of affinity which bodies have for each other that all the chemical compositions and decompositions are effected every chemical fact or experiment is an instance of the same kind and whenever the decomposition of a body is performed by the addition of any single new substance it is said to be effected by simple elective attractions but it often happens that no simple substance will decompose a body and that in order to effect this you must offer to the compound a body which is itself composed of two or sometimes three principles which would not each separately perform the decomposition in this case there are two new compounds formed in consequence of a reciprocal decomposition and recomposition all instances of this kind are called double elective attractions caroline i confess i do not understand this clearly mrs b you will easily comprehend it by the assistance of this diagram in which the reciprocal forces of attraction are represented by numbers original compound sulphat of soda soda 8 sulphuric acid quies cent result result nitrat 7 divellent attractions 6 13 sulphat of soda of lime attrac tions nitric acid 4 lime 12 original compound nitrat of lime we here suppose that we are to decompose sulphat of soda that is to separate the acid from the alkali if for this purpose we add some lime in order to make it combine with the acid we shall fail in our attempt because the soda and the sulphuric acid attract each other by a force which is superior and by way of supposition is represented by the number 8 while the lime tends to unite with this acid by an affinity equal only to the number 6 it is plain therefore that the sulphat of soda will not be decomposed since a force equal to 8 cannot be overcome by a force equal only to 6 caroline so far this appears very clear mrs b if on the other hand we endeavour to decompose this salt by nitric acid which tends to combine with soda we shall be equally unsuccessful as nitric acid tends to unite with the alkali by a force equal only to 7 in neither of these cases of simple elective attraction therefore can we accomplish our purpose but let us previously combine together the lime and nitric acid so as to form a nitrat of lime a compound salt the constituents of which are united by a power equal to 4 if then we present this compound to the sulphat of soda a decomposition will ensue because the sum of the forces which tend to preserve the two salts in their actual state is not equal to that of the forces which tend to decompose them and to form new combinations the nitric acid therefore will combine with the soda and the sulphuric acid with the lime caroline i understand you now very well this double effect takes place because the numbers 8 and 4 which represent the degrees of attraction of the constituents of the two original salts make a sum less than the numbers 7 and 6 which represent the degrees of attraction of the two new compounds that will in consequence be formed mrs b precisely so caroline but what is the meaning of quiescent and divellent forces which are written in the diagram mrs b quiescent forces are those which tend to preserve compounds in a state of rest or such as they actually are divellent forces those which tend to destroy that state of combination and to form new compounds these are the principal circumstances relative to the doctrine of chemical attractions which have been laid down as rules by modern chemists a few others might be mentioned respecting the same theory but of less importance and such as would take us too far from our plan i should however not omit to mention that mr berthollet a celebrated french chemist has questioned the uniform operation of elective attraction and has advanced the opinion that in chemical combinations the changes which take place depend not only upon the affinities but also in some degree on the respective quantities of the substances concerned on the heat applied during the process and some other circumstances caroline in that case i suppose there would hardly be two compounds exactly similar though composed of the same materials mrs b on the contrary it is found that a remarkable uniformity prevails as to proportions between the ingredients of bodies of similar composition thus water as you may recollect to have seen in a former conversation is composed of two volumes of hydrogen gas to one of oxygen and this is always found to be precisely the proportion of its constituents from whatever source the water be derived the same uniformity prevails with regard to the various salts the acid and alkali in each kind of salt being always found to combine in the same proportions sometimes it is true the same acid and the same alkali are capable of making two distinct kinds of salts but in all these cases it is found that one of the salts contains just twice or in some instances thrice as much acid or alkali as the other emily if the proportions in which bodies combine are so constant and so well defined how can mr berthollets remark be reconciled with this uniform system of combination mrs b great as that philosophers authority is in chemistry it is now generally supposed that his doubts on this subject were in a great degree groundless and that the exceptions he has observed in the laws of definite proportions have been only apparent and may be accounted for consistently with those laws caroline pray mrs b can you decompose a salt by means of electricity in the same way as we decompose water mrs b undoubtedly and i am glad this question occurred to you because it gives me an opportunity of showing you some very interesting experiments on the subject if we dissolve a quantity however small of any salt in a glass of water and if we plunge into it the extremities of the wires which proceed from the two ends of the voltaic battery the salt will be gradually decomposed the acid being attracted by the positive and the alkali by the negative wire emily but how can you render that decomposition perceptible mrs b by placing in contact with the extremities of each wire in the solution pieces of paper stained with certain vegetable colours which are altered by the contact of an acid or an alkali thus this blue vegetable preparation called litmus becomes red when touched by an acid and the juice of violets becomes green by the contact of an alkali but the experiment can be made in a much more distinct manner by receiving the extremities of the wires into two different vessels so that the alkali shall appear in one vessel and the acid in the other caroline but then the voltaic circle will not be completed how can any effect be produced mrs b you are right i ought to have added that the two vessels must be connected together by some interposed substance capable of conducting electricity a piece of moistened cottonwick answers this purpose very well you see that the cotton plate xiii fig 2 c has one end immersed in one glass and the other end in the other so as to establish a communication between any fluids contained in them we shall now put into each of the glasses a little glauber salt or sulphat of soda which consists of an acid and an alkali and then we shall fill the glasses with water which will dissolve the salt let us now connect the glasses by means of the wires e d with the two ends of the battery thus illustration plate xiii vol ii page 16 fig 1 voltaic battery of improved construction with the plates out of the cells fig 2 3 4 instances of chemical decomposition by the voltaic battery caroline the wires are already giving out small bubbles is this owing to the decomposition of the salt mrs b no these are bubbles produced by the decomposition of the water as you saw in a former experiment in order to render the separation of the acid from the alkali visible i pour into the glass a which is connected with the positive wire a few drops of a solution of litmus which the least quantity of acid turns red and into the other glass b which is connected with the negative wire i pour a few drops of the juice of violets emily the blue solution is already turning red all round the wire caroline and the violet solution is beginning to turn green this is indeed very singular mrs b you will be still more astonished when we vary the experiment in this manner these three glasses fig 3 f g h are as in the former instance connected together by wetted cotton but the middle one alone contains a saline solution the two others containing only distilled water coloured as before by vegetable infusions yet on making the connection with the battery the alkali will appear in the negative glass h and the acid in the positive glass f though neither of them contained any saline matter emily so that the acid and alkali must be conveyed right and left from the central glass into the other glasses by means of the connecting moistened cotton mrs b exactly so and you may render the experiment still more striking by putting into the central glass k fig 3 an alkaline solution the glauber salt being placed into the negative glass l and the positive glass i containing only water the acid will be attracted by the positive wire m and will actually appear in the vessel i after passing through the alkaline solution k without combining with it although you know acids and alkalies are so much disposed to combine but this conversation has already much exceeded our usual limits and we cannot enlarge more upon this interesting subject at present conversation xiv on alkalies mrs b having now given you some idea of the laws by which chemical attractions are governed we may proceed to the examination of bodies which are formed in consequence of these attractions the first class of compounds that present themselves to our notice in our gradual ascent to the most complicated combinations are bodies composed of only two principles the sulphurets phosphurets carburets c are of this description but the most numerous and important of these compounds are the combinations of oxygen with the various simple substances with which it has a tendency to unite of these you have already acquired some knowledge but it will be necessary to enter into further particulars respecting the nature and properties of those most deserving our notice of this class are the alkalies and the earths which we shall successively examine we shall first take a view of the alkalies of which there are three viz potash soda and ammonia the two first are called fixed alkalies because they exist in a solid form at the temperature of the atmosphere and require a great heat to be volatilised they consist as you already know of metallic bases combined with oxygen in potash the proportions are about eightysix parts of potassium to fourteen of oxygen and in soda seventyseven parts of sodium to twentythree of oxygen the third alkali ammonia has been distinguished by the name of volatile alkali because its natural form is that of gas its composition is of a more complicated nature of which we shall speak hereafter some of the earths bear so strong a resemblance in their properties to the alkalies that it is difficult to know under which head to place them the celebrated french chemist fourcroy has classed two of them barytes and strontites with the alkalies but as lime and magnesia have almost an equal title to that rank i think it better not to separate them and therefore have adopted the common method of classing them with the earths and of distinguishing them by the name of alkaline earths the general properties of alkalies are an acrid burning taste a pungent smell and a caustic action on the skin and flesh caroline i wonder they should be caustic mrs b since they contain so little oxygen mrs b whatever substance has an affinity for any one of the constituents of animal matter sufficiently powerful to decompose it is entitled to the appellation of caustic the alkalies in their pure state have a very strong attraction for water for hydrogen and for carbon which you know are the constituent principles of oil and it is chiefly by absorbing these substances from animal matter that they effect its decomposition for when diluted with a sufficient quantity of water or combined with any oily substance they lose their causticity but to return to the general properties of alkaliesthey change as we have already seen the colour of syrup of violets and other blue vegetable infusions to green and have in general a very great tendency to unite with acids although the respective qualities of these two classes of bodies form a remarkable contrast we shall examine the result of the combination of acids and alkalies more particularly hereafter it will be sufficient at present to inform you that whenever acids are brought in contact with alkalies or alkaline earths they unite with a remarkable eagerness and form compounds perfectly different from either of their constituents these bodies are called neutral or compound salts the dry white powder which you see in this phial is pure caustic potash it is very difficult to preserve it in this state as it attracts with extreme avidity the moisture from the atmosphere and if the air were not perfectly excluded it would in a very short time be actually melted emily it is then i suppose always found in a liquid state mrs b no it exists in nature in a great variety of forms and combinations but is never found in its pure separate state it is combined with carbonic acid with which it exists in every part of the vegetable kingdom and is most commonly obtained from the ashes of vegetables which are the residue that remains after all the other parts have been volatilised by combustion caroline but you once said that after all the volatile parts of a vegetable were evaporated the substance that remained was charcoal mrs b i am surprised that you should still confound the processes of volatilisation and combustion in order to procure charcoal we evaporate such parts as can be reduced to vapour by the operation of heat alone but when we burn the vegetable we burn the carbon also and convert it into carbonic acid gas caroline that is true i hope i shall make no more mistakes in my favourite theory of combustion mrs b potash derives its name from the pots in which the vegetables from which it was obtained used formerly to be burnt the alkali remained mixed with the ashes at the bottom and was thence called potash emily the ashes of a woodfire then are potash since they are vegetable ashes mrs b they always contain more or less potash but are very far from consisting of that substance alone as they are a mixture of various earths and salts which remain after the combustion of vegetables and from which it is not easy to separate the alkali in its pure form the process by which potash is obtained even in the imperfect state in which it is used in the arts is much more complicated than simple combustion it was once deemed impossible to separate it entirely from all foreign substances and it is only in chemical laboratories that it is to be met with in the state of purity in which you find it in this phial woodashes are however valuable for the alkali which they contain and are used for some purposes without any further preparation purified in a certain degree they make what is commonly called pearlash which is of great efficacy in taking out grease in washing linen c for potash combines readily with oil or fat with which it forms a compound well known to you under the name of soap caroline really then i should think it would be better to wash all linen with pearlash than with soap as in the latter case the alkali being already combined with oil must be less efficacious in extracting grease mrs b its effect would be too powerful on fine linen and would injure its texture pearlash is therefore only used for that which is of a strong coarse kind for the same reason you cannot wash your hands with plain potash but when mixed with oil in the form of soap it is soft as well as cleansing and is therefore much better adapted to the purpose caustic potash as we already observed acts on the skin and animal fibre in virtue of its attraction for water and oil and converts all animal matter into a kind of saponaceous jelly emily are vegetables the only source from which potash can be derived mrs b no for though far most abundant in vegetables it is by no means confined to that class of bodies being found also on the surface of the earth mixed with various minerals especially with earths and stones whence it is supposed to be conveyed into vegetables by the roots of the plant it is also met with though in very small quantities in some animal substances the most common state of potash is that of carbonat i suppose you understand what that is emily i believe so though i do not recollect that you ever mentioned the word before if i am not mistaken it must be a compound salt formed by the union of carbonic acid with potash mrs b very true you see how admirably the nomenclature of modern chemistry is adapted to assist the memory when you hear the name of a compound you necessarily learn what are its constituent parts and when you are acquainted with these constituents you can immediately name the compound which they form caroline pray how were bodies arranged and distinguished before this nomenclature was introduced mrs b chemistry was then a much more difficult study for every substance had an arbitrary name which it derived either from the person who discovered it as glaubers salts for instance or from some other circumstance relative to it though quite unconnected with its real nature as potash these names have been retained for some of the simple bodies for as this class is not numerous and therefore can easily be remembered it has not been thought necessary to change them emily yet i think it would have rendered the new nomenclature more complete to have methodised the names of the elementary as well as of the compound bodies though it could not have been done in the same manner but the names of the simple substances might have indicated their nature or at least some of their principal properties and if like the acids and compound salts all the simple bodies had a similar termination they would have been immediately known as such so complete and regular a nomenclature would i think have given a clearer and more comprehensive view of chemistry than the present which is a medley of the old and new terms mrs b but you are not aware of the difficulty of introducing into science an entire set of new terms it obliges all the teachers and professors to go to school again and if some of the old names that are least exceptionable were not left as an introduction to the new ones few people would have had industry and perseverance enough to submit to the study of a completely new language and the inferior classes of artists who can only act from habit and routine would at least for a time have felt material inconvenience from a total change of their habitual terms from these considerations lavoisier and his colleagues who invented the new nomenclature thought it most prudent to leave a few links of the old chain in order to connect it with the new one besides you may easily conceive the inconvenience which might arise from giving a regular nomenclature to substances the simple nature of which is always uncertain for the new names might perhaps have proved to have been founded in error and indeed cautious as the inventors of the modern chemical language have been it has already been found necessary to modify it in many respects in those few cases however in which new terms have been adopted to designate simple bodies these names have been so contrived as to indicate one of the chief properties of the body in question this is the case with oxygen which as i explained to you signifies generator of acids and hydrogen generator of water if all the elementary bodies had a similar termination as you propose it would be necessary to change the name of any that might hereafter be found of a compound nature which would be very inconvenient in this age of discovery but to return to the alkalies we shall now try to melt some of this caustic potash in a little water as a circumstance occurs during its solution very worthy of observation do you feel the heat that is produced caroline yes i do but is not this directly contrary to our theory of latent heat according to which heat is disengaged when fluids become solid and cold produced when solids are melted mrs b the latter is really the case in all solutions and if the solution of caustic alkalies seems to make an exception to the rule it does not i believe form any solid objection to the theory the matter may be explained thus when water first comes in contact with the potash it produces an effect similar to the slaking of lime that is the water is solidified in combining with the potash and thus loses its latent heat this is the heat that you now feel and which is therefore produced not by the melting of the solid but by the solidification of the fluid but when there is more water than the potash can absorb and solidify the latter then yields to the solvent power of the water and if we do not perceive the cold produced by its melting it is because it is counterbalanced by the heat previously disengaged a very remarkable property of potash is the formation of glass by its fusion with siliceous earth you are not yet acquainted with this last substance further than its being in the list of simple bodies it is sufficient for the present that you should know that sand and flint are chiefly composed of it alone it is infusible but mixed with potash it melts when exposed to the heat of a furnace combines with the alkali and runs into glass footnote this defence of the general theory however plausible is liable to some obvious objections the phenomenon might perhaps be better accounted for by supposing that a solution of alkali in water has less capacity for heat than either water or alkali in their separate state caroline who would ever have supposed that the same substance which converts transparent oil into such an opake body as soap should transform that opake substance sand into transparent glass mrs b the transparency or opacity of bodies does not i conceive depend so much upon their intimate nature as upon the arrangement of their particles we cannot have a more striking instance of this than is afforded by the different states of carbon which though it commonly appears in the form of a black opake body sometimes assumes the most dazzling transparent form in nature that of diamond which you recollect is carbon and which in all probability derives its beautiful transparency from the peculiar arrangement of its particles during their crystallisation emily i never should have supposed that the formation of glass was so simple a process as you describe it mrs b it is by no means an easy operation to make perfect glass for if the sand or flint from which the siliceous earth is obtained be mixed with any metallic particles or other substance which cannot be vitrified the glass will be discoloured or defaced by opake specks caroline that i suppose is the reason why objects so often appear irregular and shapeless through a common glasswindow mrs b this species of imperfection proceeds i believe from another cause it is extremely difficult to prevent the lower part of the vessels in which the materials of glass are fused from containing a more dense vitreous matter than the upper on account of the heavier ingredients falling to the bottom when this happens it occasions the appearance of veins or waves in the glass from the difference of density in its several parts which produces an irregular refraction of the rays of light that pass through it another species of imperfection sometimes arises from the fusion not being continued for a length of time sufficient to combine the two ingredients completely or from the due proportion of potash and silex which are as two to one not being carefully observed the glass in those cases will be liable to alteration from the action of the air of salts and especially of acids which will effect its decomposition by combining with the potash and forming compound salts emily what an extremely useful substance potash is mrs b besides the great importance of potash in the manufactures of glass and soap it is of very considerable utility in many of the other arts and in its combinations with several acids particularly the nitric with which it forms saltpetre caroline then saltpetre must be a nitrat of potash but we are not yet acquainted with the nitric acid mrs b we shall therefore defer entering into the particulars of these combinations till we come to a general review of the compound salts in order to avoid confusion it will be better at present to confine ourselves to the alkalies emily cannot you show us the change of colour which you said the alkalies produced on blue vegetable infusions mrs b yes very easily i shall dip a piece of white paper into this syrup of violets which you see is of a deep blue and dyes the paper of the same colour as soon as it is dry we shall dip it into a solution of potash which though itself colourless will turn the paper green caroline so it has indeed and do the other alkalies produce a similar effect mrs b exactly the same we may now proceed to soda which however important will detain us but a very short time as in all its general properties it very strongly resembles potash indeed so great is their similitude that they have been long confounded and they can now scarcely be distinguished except by the difference of the salts which they form with acids the great source of this alkali is the sea where combined with a peculiar acid it forms the salt with which the waters of the ocean are so strongly impregnated emily is not that the common table salt mrs b the very same but again we must postpone entering into the particulars of this interesting combination till we treat of the neutral salts soda may be obtained from common salt but the easiest and most usual method of procuring it is by the combustion of marine plants an operation perfectly analogous to that by which potash is obtained from vegetables emily from what does soda derive its name mrs b from a plant called by us soda and by the arabs kali which affords it in great abundance kali has indeed given its name to the alkalies in general caroline does soda form glass and soap in the same manner as potash mrs b yes it does it is of equal importance in the arts and is even preferred to potash for some purposes but you will not be able to distinguish their properties till we examine the compound salts which they form with acids we must therefore leave soda for the present and proceed to ammonia or the volatile alkali emily i long to hear something of this alkali is it not of the same nature as hartshorn mrs b yes it is as you will see byandbye this alkali is seldom found in nature in its pure state it is most commonly extracted from a compound salt called sal ammoniac which was formerly imported from ammonia a region of libya from which both these salts and the alkali derive their names the crystals contained in this bottle are specimens of this salt which consists of a combination of ammonia and muriatic acid caroline then it should be called muriat of ammonia for though i am ignorant what muriatic acid is yet i know that its combination with ammonia cannot but be so called and i am surprised to see sal ammoniac inscribed on the label mrs b that is the name by which it has been so long known that the modern chemists have not yet succeeded in banishing it altogether and it is still sold under that name by druggists though by scientific chemists it is more properly called muriat of ammonia caroline both the popular and the common name should be inscribed on labelsthis would soon introduce the new nomenclature emily by what means can the ammonia be separated from the muriatic acid mrs b by chemical attractions but this operation is too complicated for you to understand till you are better acquainted with the agency of affinities emily and when extracted from the salt what kind of substance is ammonia mrs b its natural form at the temperature of the atmosphere when free from combination is that of gas and in this state it is called ammoniacal gas but it mixes very readily with water and can be thus obtained in a liquid form caroline you said that ammonia was more complicated in its composition than the other alkalies pray of what principles does it consist mrs b it was discovered a few years since by berthollet a celebrated french chemist that it consisted of about one part of hydrogen to four parts of nitrogen having heated ammoniacal gas under a receiver by causing the electrical spark to pass repeatedly through it he found that it increased considerably in bulk lost all its alkaline properties and was actually converted into hydrogen and nitrogen gases and from the latest and most accurate experiments the proportions appear to be one volume of nitrogen gas to three of hydrogen gas caroline ammonia therefore has not like the two other alkalies a metallic basis mrs b it is believed it has though it is extremely difficult to reconcile that idea with what i have just stated of its chemical nature but the fact is that although this supposed metallic basis of ammonia has never been obtained distinct and separate yet both professor berzelius of stockholm and sir h davy have succeeded in forming a combination of mercury with the basis of ammonia which has so much the appearance of an amalgam that it strongly corroborates the idea of ammonia having a metallic basis but these theoretical points are full of difficulties and doubts and it would be useless to dwell any longer upon them let us therefore return to the properties of volatile alkali ammoniacal gas is considerably lighter than oxygen gas and only about half the weight of atmospherical air it possesses most of the properties of the fixed alkalies but cannot be of so much use in the arts on account of its volatile nature it is therefore never employed in the manufacture of glass but it forms soap with oils equally as well as potash and soda it resembles them likewise in its strong attraction for water for which reason it can be collected in a receiver over mercury only footnote this amalgam is easily obtained by placing a globule of mercury upon a piece of muriat or carbonat of ammonia and electrifying this globule by the voltaic battery the globule instantly begins to expand to three or four times its former size and becomes much less fluid though without losing its metallic lustre a change which is ascribed to the metallic basis of ammonia uniting with the mercury this is an extremely curious experiment caroline i do not understand this mrs b do you recollect the method which we used to collect gases in a glassreceiver over water caroline perfectly mrs b ammoniacal gas has so strong a tendency to unite with water that instead of passing through that fluid it would be instantaneously absorbed by it we can therefore neither use water for that purpose nor any other liquid of which water is a component part so that in order to collect this gas we are obliged to have recourse to mercury a liquid which has no action upon it and a mercurial bath is used instead of a water bath such as we employed on former occasions water impregnated with this gas is nothing more than the fluid which you mentioned at the beginning of the conversationhartshorn it is the ammoniacal gas escaping from the water which gives it so powerful a smell emily but there is no appearance of effervescence in hartshorn mrs b because the particles of gas that rise from the water are too subtle and minute for their effect to be visible water diminishes in density by being impregnated with ammoniacal gas and this augmentation of bulk increases its capacity for caloric emily in making hartshorn then or impregnating water with ammonia heat must be absorbed and cold produced mrs b that effect would take place if it was not counteracted by another circumstance the gas is liquefied by incorporating with the water and gives out its latent heat the condensation of the gas more than counterbalances the expansion of the water therefore upon the whole heat is produced but if you dissolve ammoniacal gas with ice or snow cold is produced can you account for that emily the gas in being condensed into a liquid must give out heat and on the other hand the snow or ice in being rarefied into a liquid must absorb heat so that between the opposite effects i should have supposed the original temperature would have been preserved mrs b but you have forgotten to take into the account the rarefaction of the water or melted ice by the impregnation of the gas and this is the cause of the cold which is ultimately produced caroline is the sal volatile the smell of which so strongly resembles hartshorn likewise a preparation of ammonia mrs b it is carbonat of ammonia dissolved in water and which in its concrete state is commonly called salts of hartshorn ammonia is caustic like the fixed alkalies as you may judge by the pungent effects of hartshorn which cannot be taken internally nor applied to delicate external parts without being plentifully diluted with water oil and acids are very excellent antidotes for alkaline poisons can you guess why caroline perhaps because the oil combines with the alkali and forms soap and thus destroys its caustic properties and the acid converts it into a compound salt which i suppose is not so pernicious as caustic alkali mrs b precisely so ammoniacal gas if it be mixed with atmospherical air and a burning taper repeatedly plunged into it will burn with a large flame of a peculiar yellow colour emily but pray tell me can ammonia be procured from this lybian salt only mrs b so far from it that it is contained in and may be extracted from all animal substances whatever hydrogen and nitrogen are two of the chief constituents of animal matter it is therefore not surprising that they should occasionally meet and combine in those proportions that compose ammonia but this alkali is more frequently generated by the spontaneous decomposition of animal substances the hydrogen and nitrogen gases that arise from putrefied bodies combine and form the volatile alkali muriat of ammonia instead of being exclusively brought from lybia as it originally was is now chiefly prepared in europe by chemical processes ammonia although principally extracted from this salt can also be produced by a great variety of other substances the horns of cattle especially those of deer yield it in abundance and it is from this circumstance that a solution of ammonia in water has been called hartshorn it may likewise be procured from wool flesh and bones in a word any animal substance whatever yields it by decomposition we shall now lay aside the alkalies however important the subject may be till we treat of their combination with acids the next time we meet we shall examine the earths conversation xv on earths mrs b the earths which we are today to examine are nine in number silex alumine barytes lime magnesia strontites yttria glucina zirconia the last three are of late discovery their properties are but imperfectly known and as they have not yet been applied to use it will be unnecessary to enter into any particulars respecting them we shall confine our remarks therefore to the first five they are composed as you have already learnt of a metallic basis combined with oxygen and from this circumstance are incombustible caroline yet i have seen turf burnt in the country and it makes an excellent fire the earth becomes red hot and produces a very great quantity of heat mrs b it is not the earth that burns my dear but the roots grass and other remnants of vegetables that are intermixed with it the caloric which is produced by the combustion of these substances makes the earth red hot and this being a bad conductor of heat retains its caloric a long time but were you to examine it when cooled you would find that it had not absorbed one particle of oxygen nor suffered any alteration from the fire earth is however from the circumstance just mentioned an excellent radiator of heat and owes its utility when mixed with fuel solely to that property it is in this point of view that count rumford has recommended balls of incombustible substances to be arranged in fireplaces and mixed with the coals by which means the caloric disengaged by the combustion of the latter is more perfectly reflected into the room and an expense of fuel is saved emily i expected that the list of earths would be much more considerable when i think of the great variety of soils i am astonished that there is not a greater number of earths to form them mrs b you might indeed almost confine that number to four for barytes strontites and the others of late discovery act but so small a part in this great theatre that they cannot be reckoned as essential to the general formation of the globe and you must not confine your idea of earths to the formation of soil for rock marble chalk slate sand flint and all kinds of stones from the precious jewels to the commonest pebbles in a word all the immense variety of mineral products may be referred to some of these earths either in a simple state or combined the one with the other or blended with other ingredients caroline precious stones composed of earth that seems very difficult to conceive emily is it more extraordinary than that the most precious of all jewels diamond should be composed of carbon but diamond forms an exception mrs b for though a stone it is not composed of earth mrs b i did not specify the exception as i knew you were so well acquainted with it besides i would call a diamond a mineral rather than a stone as the latter term always implies the presence of some earth caroline i cannot conceive how such coarse materials can be converted into such beautiful productions mrs b we are very far from understanding all the secret resources of nature but i do not think the spontaneous formation of the crystals which we call precious stones one of the most difficult phenomena to comprehend by the slow and regular work of ages perhaps of hundreds of ages these earths may be gradually dissolved by water and as gradually deposited by their solvent in the undisturbed process of crystallisation the regular arrangement of their particles during their reunion in a solid mass gives them that brilliancy transparency and beauty for which they are so much admired and renders them in appearance so totally different from their rude and primitive ingredients caroline but how does it happen that they are spontaneously dissolved and afterwards crystallised mrs b the scarcity of many kinds of crystals as rubies emeralds topazes c shows that their formation is not an operation very easily carried on in nature but cannot you imagine that when water holding in solution some particles of earth filters through the crevices of hills or mountains and at length dribbles into some cavern each successive drop may be slowly evaporated leaving behind it the particle of earth which it held in solution you know that crystallisation is more regular and perfect in proportion as the evaporation of the solvent is slow and uniform nature therefore who knows no limit of time has in all works of this kind an infinite advantage over any artist who attempts to imitate such productions emily i can now conceive that the arrangement of the particles of earth during crystallisation may be such as to occasion transparency by admitting a free passage to the rays of light but i cannot understand why crystallised earths should assume such beautiful colours as most of them do sapphire for instance is of a celestial blue ruby a deep red topaz a brilliant yellow mrs b nothing is more simple than to suppose that the arrangement of their particles is such as to transmit some of the coloured rays of light and to reflect others in which case the stone must appear of the colour of the rays which it reflects but besides it frequently happens that the colour of a stone is owing to a mixture of some metallic matter caroline pray are the different kinds of precious stones each composed of one individual earth or are they formed of a combination of several earths mrs b a great variety of materials enters into the composition of most of them not only several earths but sometimes salts and metals the earths however in their simple state frequently form very beautiful crystals and indeed it is in that state only that they can be obtained perfectly pure emily is not the derbyshire spar produced by the crystallisation of earths in the way you have just explained i have been in some of the subterraneous caverns where it is found which are similar to those you have described mrs b yes but this spar is a very imperfect specimen of crystallisation it consists of a variety of ingredients confusedly blended together as you may judge by its opacity and by the various colours and appearances which it exhibits but in examining the earths in their most perfect and agreeable form we must not lose sight of that state in which they are commonly found and which if less pleasing to the eye is far more interesting by its utility all the earths are more or less endowed with alkaline properties but there are four barytes magnesia lime and strontites which are called alkaline earths because they possess those qualities in so great a degree as to entitle them in most respects to the rank of alkalies they combine and form compound salts with acids in the same way as alkalies they are like them susceptible of a considerable degree of causticity and are acted upon in a similar manner by chemical tests the remaining earths silex and alumine with one or two others of late discovery are in some degree more earthy that is to say they possess more completely the properties common to all the earths which are insipidity dryness unalterableness in the fire infusibility c caroline yet did you not tell us that silex or siliceous earth when mixed with an alkali was fusible and run into glass mrs b yes my dear but the characteristic properties of earths which i have mentioned are to be considered as belonging to them in a state of purity only a state in which they are very seldom to be met with in nature besides these general properties each earth has its own specific characters by which it is distinguished from any other substance let us therefore review them separately silex or silica abounds in flint sand sandstone agate jasper c it forms the basis of many precious stones and particularly of those which strike fire with steel it is rough to the touch scratches and wears away metals it is acted upon by no acid but the fluoric and is not soluble in water by any known process but nature certainly dissolves it by means with which we are unacquainted and thus produces a variety of siliceous crystals and amongst these rock crystal which is the purest specimen of this earth silex appears to have been intended by providence to form the solid basis of the globe to serve as a foundation for the original mountains and give them that hardness and durability which has enabled them to resist the various revolutions which the surface of the earth has successively undergone from these mountains siliceous rocks have during the course of ages been gradually detached by torrents of water and brought down in fragments these in the violence and rapidity of their descent are sometimes crumbled to sand and in this state form the beds of rivers and of the sea chiefly composed of siliceous materials sometimes the fragments are broken without being pulverised by their fall and assume the form of pebbles which gradually become rounded and polished emily pray what is the true colour of silex which forms such a variety of different coloured substances sand is brown flint is nearly black and precious stones are of all colours mrs b pure silex such as is found only in the chemists laboratory is perfectly white and the various colours which it assumes in the different substances you have just mentioned proceed from the different ingredients with which it is mixed in them caroline i wonder that silex is not more valuable since it forms the basis of so many precious stones mrs b you must not forget that the value we set upon precious stones depends in a great measure upon the scarcity with which nature affords them for were those productions either common or perfectly imitable by art they would no longer notwithstanding their beauty be so highly esteemed but the real value of siliceous earth in many of the most useful arts is very extensive mixed with clay it forms the basis of all the various kinds of earthen ware from the most common utensils to the most refined ornaments emily and we must recollect its importance in the formation of glass with potash mrs b nor should we omit to mention likewise many other important uses of silex such as being the chief ingredient of some of the most durable cements of mortar c i said before that siliceous earth combined with no acid but the fluoric it is for this reason that glass is liable to be attacked by that acid only which from its strong affinity for silex forces that substance from its combination with the potash and thus destroys the glass we will now hasten to proceed to the other earths for i am rather apprehensive of your growing weary of this part of our subject caroline the history of the earths is not quite so entertaining as that of the simple substances mrs b perhaps not but it is absolutely indispensable that you should know something of them for they form the basis of so many interesting and important compounds that their total omission would throw great obscurity on our general outline of chemical science we shall however review them in as cursory a manner as the subject can admit of alumine derives its name from a compound salt called alum of which it forms the basis caroline but it ought to be just the contrary mrs b the simple body should give instead of taking its name from the compound mrs b that is true but as the compound salt was known long before its basis was discovered it was very natural that when the earth was at length separated from the acid it should derive its name from the compound from which it was obtained however to remove your scruples we will call the salt according to the new nomenclature sulphat of alumine from this combination alumine may be obtained in its pure state it is then soft to the touch makes a paste with water and hardens in the fire in nature it is found chiefly in clay which contains a considerable proportion of this earth it is very abundant in fullers earth slate and a variety of other mineral productions there is indeed scarcely any mineral substance more useful to mankind than alumine in the state of clay it forms large strata of the earth gives consistency to the soil of valleys and of all low and damp spots such as swamps and marshes the beds of lakes ponds and springs are almost entirely of clay instead of allowing of the filtration of water as sand does it forms an impenetrable bottom and by this means water is accumulated in the caverns of the earth producing those reservoirs whence springs issue and spout out at the surface emily i always thought that these subterraneous reservoirs of water were bedded by some hard stone or rock which the water could not penetrate mrs b that is not the case for in the course of time water would penetrate or wear away silex or any other kind of stone while it is effectually stopped by clay or alumine the solid compact soils such as are fit for corn owe their consistence in a great measure to alumine this earth is therefore used to improve sandy or chalky soils which do not retain a sufficient quantity of water for the purpose of vegetation alumine is the most essential ingredient in all potteries it enters into the composition of brick as well as that of the finest porcelain the addition of silex and water hardens it renders it susceptible of a degree of vitrification and makes it perfectly fit for its various purposes caroline i can scarcely conceive that brick and china should be made of the same materials mrs b brick consists almost entirely of baked clay but a certain proportion of silex is essential to the formation of earthen or stone ware in common potteries sand is used for that purpose a more pure silex is i believe necessary for the composition of porcelain as well as a finer kind of clay and these materials are no doubt more carefully prepared and curiously wrought in the one case than in the other porcelain owes its beautiful semitransparency to a commencement of vitrification emily but the commonest earthenware though not transparent is covered with a kind of glazing mrs b that precaution is equally necessary for use as for beauty as the ware would be liable to be spoiled and corroded by a variety of substances if not covered with a coating of this kind in porcelain it consists of enamel which is a fine white opake glass formed of metallic oxyds sand salts and such other materials as are susceptible of vitrification the glazing of common earthenware is made chiefly of oxyd of lead or sometimes merely of salt which when thinly spread over earthen vessels will at a certain heat run into opake glass caroline and of what nature are the colours which are used for painting porcelain mrs b they are all composed of metallic oxyds so that these colours instead of receiving injury from the application of fire are strengthened and developed by its action which causes them to undergo different degrees of oxydation alumine and silex are not only often combined by art but they have in nature a very strong tendency to unite and are found combined in different proportions in various gems and other minerals indeed many of the precious stones such as ruby oriental sapphire amethyst c consist chiefly of alumine we may now proceed to the alkaline earths i shall say but a few words on barytes as it is hardly ever used except in chemical laboratories it is remarkable for its great weight and its strong alkaline properties such as destroying animal substances turning green some blue vegetable colours and showing a powerful attraction for acids this last property it possesses to such a degree particularly with regard to the sulphuric acid that it will always detect its presence in any substance or combination whatever by immediately uniting with it and forming a sulphat of barytes this renders it a very valuable chemical test it is found pretty abundantly in nature in the state of carbonat from which the pure earth can be easily separated the next earth we have to consider is lime this is a substance of too great and general importance to be passed over so slightly as the last lime is strongly alkaline in nature it is not met with in its simple state as its affinity for water and carbonic acid is so great that it is always found combined with these substances with which it forms the common limestone but it is separated in the kiln from these ingredients which are volatilised whenever a sufficient degree of heat is applied emily pure lime then is nothing but limestone which has been deprived in the kiln of its water and carbonic acid mrs b precisely in this state it is called quicklime and it is so caustic that it is capable of decomposing the dead bodies of animals very rapidly without their undergoing the process of putrefaction i have here some quick lime which is kept carefully corked up in a bottle to prevent the access of air for were it at all exposed to the atmosphere it would absorb both moisture and carbonic acid gas from it and be soon slaked here is also some limestonewe shall pour a little water on each and observe the effects that result from it caroline how the quicklime hisses it is become excessively hot it swells and now it bursts and crumbles to powder while the water appears to produce no kind of alteration on the limestone mrs b because the limestone is already saturated with water whilst the quicklime which has been deprived of it in the kiln combines with it with very great avidity and produces this prodigious disengagement of heat the cause of which i formerly explained to you do you recollect it emily yes you said that the heat did not proceed from the lime but from the water which was solidified and thus parted with its heat of liquidity mrs b very well if we continue to add successive quantities of water to the lime after being slaked and crumbled as you see it will then gradually be diffused in the water till it will at length be dissolved in it and entirely disappear but for this purpose it requires no less than 700 times its weight of water this solution is called limewater caroline how very small then is the proportion of lime dissolved mrs b barytes is still of more difficult solution it dissolves only in 900 times its weight of water but it is much more soluble in the state of crystals the liquid contained in this bottle is limewater it is often used as a medicine chiefly i believe for the purpose of combining with and neutralising the superabundant acid which it meets with in the stomach emily i am surprised that it is so perfectly clear it does not at all partake of the whiteness of the lime mrs b have you forgotten that in solutions the solid body is so minutely subdivided by the fluid as to become invisible and therefore will not in the least degree impair the transparency of the solvent i said that the attraction of lime for carbonic acid was so strong that it would absorb it from the atmosphere we may see this effect by exposing a glass of limewater to the air the lime will then separate from the water combine with the carbonic acid and reappear on the surface in the form of a white film which is carbonat of lime commonly called chalk caroline chalk is then a compound salt i never should have supposed that those immense beds of chalk that we see in many parts of the country were a salt now the white film begins to appear on the surface of the water but it is far from resembling hard solid chalk mrs b that is owing to its state of extreme division in a little time it will collect into a more compact mass and subside at the bottom of the glass if you breathe into limewater the carbonic acid which is mixed with the air that you expire will produce the same effect it is an experiment very easily made i shall pour some limewater into this glass tube and by breathing repeatedly into it you will soon perceive a precipitation of chalk emily i see already a small white cloud formed mrs b it is composed of minute particles of chalk at present it floats in the water but it will soon subside carbonat of lime or chalk you see is insoluble in water since the lime which was dissolved reappears when converted into chalk but you must take notice of a very singular circumstance which is that chalk is soluble in water impregnated with carbonic acid caroline it is very curious indeed that carbonic acid gas should render lime soluble in one instance and insoluble in the other mrs b i have here a bottle of seltzer water which you know is strongly impregnated with carbonic acid let us pour a little of it into a glass of limewater you see that it immediately forms a precipitation of carbonat of lime emily yes a white cloud appears mrs b i shall now pour an additional quantity of the seltzer water into the limewater emily how singular the cloud is redissolved and the liquid is again transparent mrs b all the mystery depends upon this circumstance that carbonat of lime is soluble in carbonic acid whilst it is insoluble in water the first quantity of carbonic acid therefore which i introduce into the limewater was employed in forming the carbonat of lime which remained visible until an additional quantity of carbonic acid dissolved it thus you see when the lime and carbonic acid are in proper proportions to form chalk the white cloud appears but when the acid predominates the chalk is no sooner formed than it is dissolved caroline that is now the case but let us try whether a further addition of limewater will again precipitate the chalk emily it does indeed the cloud reappears because i suppose there is now no more of the carbonic acid than is necessary to form chalk and in order to dissolve the chalk a superabundance of acid is required mrs b we have i think carried this experiment far enough every repetition would but exhibit the same appearances lime combines with most of the acids to which the carbonic as being the weakest readily yields it but these combinations we shall have an opportunity of noticing more particularly hereafter it unites with phosphorus and with sulphur in their simple state in short of all the earths lime is that which nature employs most frequently and most abundantly in its innumerable combinations it is the basis of all calcareous earths and stones we find it likewise in the animal and the vegetable creations emily and in the arts is not lime of very great utility mrs b scarcely any substance more so you know that it is a most essential requisite in building as it constitutes the basis of all cements such as mortar stucco plaister c lime is also of infinite importance in agriculture it lightens and warms soils that are too cold and compact in consequence of too great a proportion of clay but it would be endless to enumerate the various purposes for which it is employed and you know enough of it to form some idea of its importance we shall therefore now proceed to the third alkaline earth magnesia caroline i am already pretty well acquainted with that earth it is a medicine mrs b it is in the state of carbonat that magnesia is usually employed medicinally it then differs but little in appearance from its simple form which is that of a very fine light white powder it dissolves in 2000 times its weight of water but forms with acids extremely soluble salts it has not so great an attraction for acids as lime and consequently yields them to the latter it is found in a great variety of mineral combinations such as slate mica amianthus and more particularly in a certain lime stone which has lately been discovered by mr tennant to contain it in very great quantities it does not attract and solidify water like lime but when mixed with water and exposed to the atmosphere it slowly absorbs carbonic acid from the latter and thus loses its causticity its chief use in medicine is like that of lime derived from its readiness to combine with and neutralise the acid which it meets with in the stomach emily yet you said that it was taken in the state of carbonat in which case it has already combined with an acid mrs b yes but the carbonic is the last of all the acids in the order of affinities it will therefore yield the magnesia to any of the others it is however frequently taken in its caustic state as a remedy for flatulence combined with sulphuric acid magnesia forms another and more powerful medicine commonly called epsom salt caroline and properly sulphat of magnesia i suppose pray why was it ever called epsom salt mrs b because there is a spring in the neighbourhood of epsom which contains this salt in great abundance the last alkaline earth which we have to mention is strontian or strontites discovered by dr hope a few years ago it so strongly resembles barytes in its properties and is so sparingly found in nature and of so little use in the arts that it will not be necessary to enter into any particulars respecting it one of the remarkable characteristic properties of strontites is that its salts when dissolved in spirit of wine tinge the flame of a deep red or blood colour conversation xvi on acids mrs b we may now proceed to the acids of the metallic oxyds you have already acquired some general notions this subject though highly interesting in its details is not of sufficient importance to our concise view of chemistry to be particularly treated of but it is absolutely necessary that you should be better acquainted with the acids and likewise with their combinations with the alkalies which form the triple compounds called neutral salts the class of acids is characterised by very distinct properties they all change blue vegetable infusions to a red colour they are all more or less sour to the taste and have a general tendency to combine with the earths alkalies and metallic oxyds you have i believe a clear idea of the nomenclature by which the base or radical of the acid and the various degrees of acidification are expressed emily yes i think so the acid is distinguished by the name of its base and its degree of oxydation that is the quantity of oxygen it contains by the termination of that name in ous or ic thus sulphureous acid is that formed by the smallest proportion of oxygen combined with sulphur sulphuric acid that which results from the combination of sulphur with the greatest quantity of oxygen mrs b a still greater latitude may in many cases be allowed to the proportions of oxygen than can be combined with acidifiable radicals for several of these radicals are susceptible of uniting with a quantity of oxygen so small as to be insufficient to give them the properties of acids in these cases therefore they are converted into oxyds such is sulphur which by exposure to the atmosphere with a degree of heat inadequate to produce inflammation absorbs a small proportion of oxygen which colours it red or brown this therefore is the first degree of oxygenation of sulphur the 2d converts it into sulphurous acid the 3d into the sulphuric acid and 4thly if it was found capable of combining with a still larger proportion of oxygen it would then be termed superoxygenated sulphuric acid emily are these various degrees of oxygenation common to all the acids mrs b no they vary much in this respect some are susceptible of only one degree of oxygenation others of two or three there are but very few that will admit of more caroline the modern nomenclature must be of immense advantage in pointing out so easily the nature of the acids and their various degrees of oxygenation mrs b till lately many of the acids had not been decomposed but analogy afforded so strong a proof of their compound nature that i never could reconcile myself to classing them with the simple bodies though this division has been adopted by several chemical writers at present there are only the muriatic and the fluoric acids which have not had their bases distinctly separated caroline we have heard of a great variety of acids pray how many are there in all mrs b i believe there are reckoned at present thirtyfour and their number is constantly increasing as the science improves but the most important and those to which we shall almost entirely confine our attention are but few i shall however give you a general view of the whole and then we shall more particularly examine those that are the most essential this class of bodies was formerly divided into mineral vegetable and animal acids according to the substances from which they were commonly obtained caroline that i should think must have been an excellent arrangement why was it altered mrs b because in many cases it produced confusion in which class for instance would you place carbonic acid caroline now i see the difficulty i should be at a loss where to place it as you have told us that it exists in the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms emily there would be the same objection with respect to phosphoric acid which though obtained chiefly from bones can also you said be found in small quantities in stones and likewise in some plants mrs b you see therefore the propriety of changing this mode of classification these objections do not exist in the present nomenclature for the composition and nature of each individual acid is in some degree pointed out instead of the class of bodies from which it is extracted and with regard to the more general division of acids they are classed under these three heads first acids of known or supposed simple bases which are formed by the union of these bases with oxygen they are the following the sulphuric carbonic nitric phosphoric arsenical acids of known and simple bases tungstenic molybdenic boracic fluoric muriatic this class comprehends the most anciently known and most important acids the sulphuric nitric and muriatic were formerly and are still frequently called mineral acids 2dly acids that have double or binary radicals and which consequently consist of triple combinations these are the vegetable acids whose common radical is a compound of hydrogen and carbon caroline but if the basis of all the vegetable acids be the same it should form but one acid it may indeed combine with different proportions of oxygen but the nature of the acid must be the same mrs b the only difference that exists in the basis of vegetable acids is the various proportions of hydrogen and carbon from which they are severally composed but this is enough to produce a number of acids apparently very dissimilar that they do not however differ essentially is proved by their susceptibility of being converted into each other by the addition or subtraction of a portion of hydrogen or of carbon the names of these acids are the acetic oxalic tartarous citric malic acids of double bases being of vegetable origin gallic mucous benzoic succinic camphoric suberic the 3d class of acids consists of those which have triple radicals and are therefore of a still more compound nature this class comprehends the animal acids which are the lactic prussic formic acids of triple bases or animal acids bombic sebacic zoonic lithic i have given you this summary account or enumeration of the acids as you may find it more satisfactory to have at once an outline or a general notion of the extent of the subject but we shall now confine ourselves to the first class which requires our more immediate attention and defer the few remarks which we shall have to make on the others till we treat of the chemistry of the animal and vegetable kingdoms the acids of simple and known radicals are all capable of being decomposed by combustible bodies to which they yield their oxygen if for instance i pour a drop of sulphuric acid on this piece of iron it will produce a spot of rust you know what that is caroline yes it is an oxyd formed by the oxygen of the acid combining with the iron mrs b in this case you see the sulphur deposits the oxygen by which it was acidified on the metal and again if we pour some acid on a compound combustible substance we shall try it on this piece of wood it will combine with one or more of the constituents of that substance and occasion a decomposition emily it has changed the colour of the wood to black how is that mrs b the oxygen deposited by the acid has burnt it you know that wood in burning becomes black before it is reduced to ashes whether it derives the oxygen which burns it from the atmosphere or from any other source the chemical effect on the wood is the same in the case of real combustion wood becomes black because it is reduced to the state of charcoal by the evaporation of its other constituents but can you tell me the reason why wood turns black when burnt by the application of an acid caroline first tell me what are the ingredients of wood mrs b hydrogen and carbon are the chief constituents of wood as of all other vegetable substances caroline well then i suppose that the oxygen of the acid combines with the hydrogen of the wood to form water and that the carbon of the wood remaining alone appears of its usual black colour mrs b very well indeed my dear that is certainly the most plausible explanation emily would not this be a good method of making charcoal mrs b it would be an extremely expensive and i believe very imperfect method for the action of the acid on the wood and the heat produced by it are far from sufficient to deprive the wood of all its evaporable parts caroline what is the reason that vinegar lemon and the acid of fruits do not produce this effect on wood mrs b they are vegetable acids whose bases are composed of hydrogen and carbon the oxygen therefore will not be disposed to quit this radical where it is already united with hydrogen the strongest of these may perhaps yield a little of their oxygen to the wood and produce a stain upon it but the carbon will not be sufficiently uncovered to assume its black colour indeed the several mineral acids themselves possess this power of charring wood in very different degrees emily cannot vegetable acids be decomposed by any combustibles mrs b no because their radical is composed of two substances which have a greater attraction for oxygen than any known body caroline and are those strong acids which burn and decompose wood capable of producing similar effects on the skin and flesh of animals mrs b yes all the mineral acids and one of them more especially possess powerful caustic qualities they actually corrode and destroy the skin and flesh but they do not produce upon these exactly the same alteration they do on wood probably because there is a great proportion of nitrogen and other substances in animal matter which prevents the separation of carbon from being so conspicuous conversation xvii of the sulphuric and phosphoric acids or the combinations of oxygen with sulphur and phosphorus and of the sulphats and phosphats mrs b in addition to the general survey which we have taken of acids i think you will find it interesting to examine individually a few of the most important of them and likewise some of their principal combinations with the alkalies alkaline earths and metals the first of the acids in point of importance is the sulphuric formerly called oil of vitriol caroline i have known it a long time by that name but had no idea that it was the same fluid as sulphuric acid what resemblance or connection can there be between oil of vitriol and this acid mrs b vitriol is the common name for sulphat of iron a salt which is formed by the combination of sulphuric acid and iron the sulphuric acid was formerly obtained by distillation from this salt and it very naturally received its name from the substance which afforded it caroline but it is still usually called oil of vitriol mrs b yes a sufficient length of time has not yet elapsed since the invention of the new nomenclature for it to be generally disseminated but as it is adopted by all scientific chemists there is every reason to suppose that it will gradually become universal when i received this bottle from the chemists oil of vitriol was inscribed on the label but as i knew you were very punctilious in regard to the nomenclature i changed it and substituted the words sulphuric acid emily this acid has neither colour nor smell but it appears much thicker than water mrs b it is nearly twice as heavy as water and has you see an oily consistence caroline and it is probably from this circumstance that it has been called an oil for it can have no real claim to that name as it does not contain either hydrogen or carbon which are the essential constituents of oil mrs b certainly and therefore it would be the more absurd to retain a name which owed its origin to such a mistaken analogy sulphuric acid in its purest state would probably be a concrete substance but its attraction for water is such that it is impossible to obtain that acid perfectly free from it it is therefore always seen in a liquid form such as you here find it one of the most striking properties of sulphuric acid is that of evolving a considerable quantity of heat when mixed with water this i have already shown you emily yes i recollect it but what was the degree of heat produced by that mixture mrs b the thermometer may be raised by it to 300 degrees which is considerably above the temperature of boiling water caroline then water might be made to boil in that mixture mrs b nothing more easy provided that you employ sufficient quantities of acid and of water and in the due proportions the greatest heat is produced by a mixture of one part of water to four of the acid we shall make a mixture of these proportions and immerse in it this thin glass tube which is full of water caroline the vessel feels extremely hot but the water does not boil yet mrs b you must allow some time for the heat to penetrate the tube and raise the temperature of the water to the boiling point caroline now it boilsand with increasing violence mrs b but it will not continue boiling long for the mixture gives out heat only while the particles of the water and the acid are mutually penetrating each other as soon as the new arrangement of those particles is effected the mixture will gradually cool and the water return to its former temperature you have seen the manner in which sulphuric acid decomposes all combustible substances whether animal vegetable or mineral and burns them by means of its oxygen caroline i have very unintentionally repeated the experiment on my gown by letting a drop of the acid fall upon it and it has made a stain which i suppose will never wash out mrs b no certainly for before you can put it into water the spot will become a hole as the acid has literally burnt the muslin caroline so it has indeed well i will fasten the stopper and put the bottle away for it is a dangerous substance oh now i have done worse still for i have spilt some on my hand mrs b it is then burned as well as your gown for you know that oxygen destroys animal as well as vegetable matters and as far as the decomposition of the skin of your finger is effected there is no remedy but by washing it immediately in water you will dilute the acid and prevent any further injury caroline it feels extremely hot i assure you mrs b you have now learned by experience how cautiously this acid must be used you will soon become acquainted with another acid the nitric which though it produces less heat on the skin destroys it still quicker and makes upon it an indelible stain you should never handle any substances of this kind without previously dipping your fingers in water which will weaken their caustic effects but since you will not repeat the experiment i must put in the stopper for the acid attracts the moisture from the atmosphere which would destroy its strength and purity emily pray how can sulphuric acid be extracted from sulphat of iron by distillation mrs b the process of distillation you know consists in separating substances from one another by means of their different degrees of volatility and by the introduction of a new chemical agent caloric thus if sulphat of iron be exposed in a retort to a proper degree of heat it will be decomposed and the sulphuric acid will be volatilised emily but now that the process of forming acids by the combustion of their radicals is known why should not this method be used for making sulphuric acid mrs b this is actually done in most manufactures but the usual method of preparing sulphuric acid does not consist in burning the sulphur in oxygen gas as we formerly did by the way of experiment but in heating it together with another substance nitre which yields oxygen in sufficient abundance to render the combustion in common air rapid and complete caroline this substance then answers the same purpose as oxygen gas mrs b exactly in manufactures the combustion is performed in a leaden chamber with water at the bottom to receive the vapour and assist its condensation the combustion is however never so perfect but that a quantity of sulphureous acid is formed at the same time for you recollect that the sulphureous acid according to the chemical nomenclature differs from the sulphuric only by containing less oxygen from its own powerful properties and from the various combinations into which it enters sulphuric acid is of great importance in many of the arts it is used also in medicine in a state of great dilution for were it taken internally in a concentrated state it would prove a most dangerous poison caroline i am sure it would burn the throat and stomach mrs b can you think of any thing that would prove an antidote to this poison caroline a large draught of water to dilute it mrs b that would certainly weaken the caustic power of the acid but it would increase the heat to an intolerable degree do you recollect nothing that would destroy its deleterious properties more effectually emily an alkali might by combining with it but then a pure alkali is itself a poison on account of its causticity mrs b there is no necessity that the alkali should be caustic soap in which it is combined with oil or magnesia either in the state of carbonat or mixed with water would prove the best antidotes emily in those cases then i suppose the potash and the magnesia would quit their combinations to form salts with the sulphuric acid mrs b precisely we may now make a few observations on the sulphureous acid which we have found to be the product of sulphur slowly and imperfectly burnt this acid is distinguished by its pungent smell and its gaseous form caroline its ariform state is i suppose owing to the smaller proportion of oxygen which renders it lighter than sulphuric acid mrs b probably for by adding oxygen to the weaker acid it may be converted into the stronger kind but this change of state may also be connected with a change of affinity with regard to caloric emily and may sulphureous acid be obtained from sulphuric acid by a diminution of oxygen mrs b yes it can be done by bringing any combustible substance in contact with the acid this decomposition is most easily performed by some of the metals these absorb a portion of the oxygen from the sulphuric acid which is thus converted into the sulphureous and flies off in its gaseous form caroline and cannot the sulphureous acid itself be decomposed and reduced to sulphur mrs b yes if this gas be heated in contact with charcoal the oxygen of the gas will combine with it and the pure sulphur is regenerated sulphureous acid is readily absorbed by water and in this liquid state it is found particularly useful in bleaching linen and woollen cloths and is much used in manufactures for those purposes i can show you its effect in destroying colours by taking out vegetable stainsi think i see a spot on your gown emily on which we may try the experiment emily it is the stain of mulberries but i shall be almost afraid of exposing my gown to the experiment after seeing the effect which the sulphuric acid produced on that of caroline mrs b there is no such danger from the sulphureous but the experiment must be made with great caution for during the formation of sulphureous acid by combustion there is always some sulphuric produced caroline but where is your sulphureous acid mrs b we may easily prepare some ourselves simply by burning a match we must first wet the stain with water and now hold it in this way at a little distance over the lighted match the vapour that arises from it is sulphureous acid and the stain you see gradually disappears emily i have frequently taken out stains by this means without understanding the nature of the process but why is it necessary to wet the stain before it is exposed to the acid fumes mrs b the moisture attracts and absorbs the sulphureous acid and it serves likewise to dilute any particles of sulphuric acid which might injure the linen sulphur is susceptible of a third combination with oxygen in which the proportion of the latter is too small to render the sulphur acid it acquires this slight oxygenation by mere exposure to the atmosphere without any elevation of temperature in this case the sulphur does not change its natural form but is only discoloured being changed to red or brown and in this state it is an oxyd of sulphur before we take leave of the sulphuric acid we shall say a few words of its principal combinations it unites with all the alkalies alkaline earths and metals to form compound salts caroline pray give me leave to interrupt you for a moment you have never mentioned any other salts than the compound or neutral salts is there no other kind mrs b the term salt has been used from time immemorial as a kind of general name for any substance that has savour odour is soluble in water and crystallisable whether it be of an acid an alkaline or compound nature but the compound salts alone retain that appellation in modern chemistry the most important of the salts formed by the combinations of the sulphuric acid are first sulphat of potash formerly called sal polychrest this is a very bitter salt much used in medicine it is found in the ashes of most vegetables but it may be prepared artificially by the immediate combination of sulphuric acid and potash this salt is easily soluble in boiling water solubility is indeed a property common to all salts and they always produce cold in melting emily that must be owing to the caloric which they absorb in passing from a solid to a fluid form mrs b that is certainly the most probable explanation sulphat of soda commonly called glaubers salt is another medicinal salt which is still more bitter than the preceding we must prepare some of these compounds that you may observe the phenomena which take place during their formation we need only pour some sulphuric acid over the soda which i have put into this glass caroline what an amazing heat is disengaged i thought you said that cold was produced by the melting of salts mrs b but you must observe that we are now making not melting a salt heat is disengaged during the formation of compound salts and a faint light is also emitted which may sometimes be perceived in the dark emily and is this heat and light produced by the union of the opposite electricities of the alkali and the acid mrs b no doubt it is if that theory be true caroline the union of an acid and an alkali is then an actual combustion mrs b not precisely though there is certainly much analogy in these processes caroline will this sulphat of soda become solid mrs b we have not i suppose mixed the acid and the alkali in the exact proportions that are required for the formation of the salt otherwise the mixture would have been almost immediately changed to a solid mass but in order to obtain it in crystals as you see it in this bottle it would be necessary first to dilute it with water and afterwards to evaporate the water during which operation the salt would gradually crystallise caroline but of what use is the addition of water if it is afterwards to be evaporated mrs b when suspended in water the acid and the alkali are more at liberty to act on each other their union is more complete and the salt assumes the regular form of crystals during the slow evaporation of its solvent sulphat of soda liquefies by heat and effloresces in the air emily pray what is the meaning of the word effloresces i do not recollect your having mentioned it before mrs b a salt is said to effloresce when it loses its water of crystallisation on being exposed to the atmosphere and is thus gradually converted into a dry powder you may observe that these crystals of sulphat of soda are far from possessing the transparency which belongs to their crystalline state they are covered with a white powder occasioned by their having been exposed to the atmosphere which has deprived their surface of its lustre by absorbing its water of crystallisation salts are in general either efflorescent or deliquescent this latter property is precisely the reverse of the former that is to say deliquescent salts absorb water from the atmosphere and are moistened and gradually melted by it muriat of lime is an instance of great deliquescence emily but are there no salts that have the same degree of attraction for water as the atmosphere and that will consequently not be affected by it mrs b yes there are many such salts as for instance common salt sulphat of magnesia and a variety of others sulphat of lime is very frequently met with in nature and constitutes the wellknown substance called gypsum or plaster of paris sulphat of magnesia commonly called epsom salt is another very bitter medicine which is obtained from seawater and from several springs or may be prepared by the direct combination of its ingredients we have formerly mentioned sulphat of alumine as constituting the common alum it is found in nature chiefly in the neighbourhood of volcanos and is particularly useful in the arts from its strong astringent qualities it is chiefly employed by dyers and calicoprinters to fix colours and is used also in the manufacture of some kinds of leather sulphuric acid combines also with the metals caroline one of these combinations sulphat of iron we are already well acquainted with mrs b that is the most important metallic salt formed by sulphuric acid and the only one that we shall here notice it is of great use in the arts and in medicine it affords a very valuable tonic it is of this salt that most of those preparations called steel medicines are composed caroline but does any carbon enter into these compositions to form steel mrs b not an atom they are therefore very improperly called steel but it is the vulgar appellation and medical men themselves often comply with the general custom sulphat of iron may be prepared as you have seen by dissolving iron in sulphuric acid but it is generally obtained from the natural production called pyrites which being a sulphuret of iron requires only exposure to the atmosphere to be oxydated in order to form the salt this therefore is much the most easy way of procuring it on a large scale emily i am surprised to find that both acids and compound salts are generally obtained from their various combinations rather than from the immediate union of their ingredients mrs b were the simple bodies always at hand their combinations would naturally be the most convenient method of forming compounds but you must consider that in most instances there is great difficulty and expense in obtaining the simple ingredients from their combinations it is therefore often more expedient to procure compounds from the decomposition of other compounds but to return to the sulphat of iron there is a certain vegetable acid called gallic acid which has the remarkable property of precipitating this salt blacki shall pour a few drops of the gallic acid into this solution of sulphat of iron caroline it is become as black as ink mrs b and it is ink in reality common writing ink is a precipitate of sulphat of iron by gallic acid the black colour is owing to the formation of gallat of iron which being insoluble remains suspended in the fluid this acid has also the property of altering the colour of iron in its metallic state you may frequently see its effect on the blade of a knife that has been used to cut certain kinds of fruits caroline true and that is perhaps the reason that a silver knife is preferred to cut fruits the gallic acid i suppose does not act upon silver is this acid found in all fruits mrs b it is contained more or less in the rind of most fruits and roots especially the radish which if scraped with a steel or iron knife has its bright red colour changed to a deep purple the knife being at the same time blackened but the vegetable substance in which the gallic acid most abounds is nutgall a kind of excrescence that grows on oaks and from which the acid is commonly obtained for its various purposes mrs b we now come to the phosphoric and phosphorous acids in treating of phosphorus you have seen how these acids may be obtained from it by combustion emily yes but i should be much surprised if it was the usual method of obtaining them since it is so very difficult to procure phosphorus in its pure state mrs b you are right my dear the phosphoric acid for general purposes is extracted from bones in which it is contained in the state of phosphat of lime from this salt the phosphoric acid is separated by means of the sulphuric which combines with the lime in its pure state phosphoric acid is either liquid or solid according to its degree of concentration among the salts formed by this acid phosphat of lime is the only one that affords much interest and this we have already observed constitutes the basis of all bones it is also found in very small quantities in some vegetables conversation xviii of the nitric and carbonic acids or the combinations of oxygen with nitrogen and carbon and of the nitrats and carbonats mrs b i am almost afraid of introducing the subject of the nitric acid as i am sure that i shall be blamed by caroline for not having made her acquainted with it before caroline why so mrs b mrs b because you have long known its radical which is nitrogen or azote and in treating of that element i did not even hint that it was the basis of an acid caroline and what could be your reason for not mentioning this acid sooner mrs b i do not know whether you will think the reason sufficiently good to acquit me but the omission i assure you did not proceed from negligence you may recollect that nitrogen was one of the first simple bodies which we examined you were then ignorant of the theory of combustion which i believe was for the first time mentioned in that lesson and therefore it would have been in vain at that time to have attempted to explain the nature and formation of acids caroline i wonder however that it never occurred to us to enquire whether nitrogen could be acidified for as we knew it was classed among the combustible bodies it was natural to suppose that it might produce an acid mrs b that is not a necessary consequence for it might combine with oxygen only in the degree requisite to form an oxyd but you will find that nitrogen is susceptible of various degrees of oxygenation some of which convert it merely into an oxyd and others give it all the acid properties the acids resulting from the combination of oxygen and nitrogen are called the nitrous and nitric acids we will begin with the nitric in which nitrogen is in the highest state of oxygenation this acid naturally exists in the form of gas but is so very soluble in water and has so great an affinity for it that one grain of water will absorb and condense ten grains of acid gas and form the limpid fluid which you see in this bottle caroline what a strong offensive smell it has mrs b this acid contains a greater abundance of oxygen than any other but it retains it with very little force emily then it must be a powerful caustic both from the facility with which it parts with its oxygen and the quantity which it affords mrs b very well emily both cause and effect are exactly such as you describe nitric acid burns and destroys all kinds of organised matter it even sets fire to some of the most combustible substances we shall pour a little of it over this piece of dry warm charcoalyou see it inflames it immediately it would do the same with oil of turpentine phosphorus and several other very combustible bodies this shows you how easily this acid is decomposed by combustible bodies since these effects must depend upon the absorption of its oxygen nitric acid has been used in the arts from time immemorial but it is only within these twentyfive years that its chemical nature has been ascertained the celebrated mr cavendish discovered that it consisted of about 10 parts of nitrogen and 25 of oxygen these principles in their gaseous state combine at a high temperature and this may be effected by repeatedly passing the electrical spark through a mixture of the two gases footnote the proportion stated by sir h davy in his chemical researches is as 1 to 2389 emily the nitrogen and oxygen gases of which the atmosphere is composed do not combine i suppose because their temperature is not sufficiently elevated caroline but in a thunderstorm when the lightning repeatedly passes through them may it not produce nitric acid we should be in a strange situation if a violent storm should at once convert the atmosphere into nitric acid mrs b there is no danger of it my dear the lightning can affect but a very small portion of the atmosphere and though it were occasionally to produce a little nitric acid yet this never could happen to such an extent as to be perceivable emily but how could the nitric acid be known and used before the method of combining its constituents was discovered mrs b before that period the nitric acid was obtained and it is indeed still extracted for the common purposes of art from the compound salt which it forms with potash commonly called nitre caroline why is it so called pray mrs b let these old unmeaning names be entirely given up by us at least and let us call this salt nitrat of potash mrs b with all my heart but it is necessary that i should at least mention the old names and more especially those which are yet in common use otherwise when you meet with them you would not be able to understand their meaning emily and how is the acid obtained from this salt mrs b by the intervention of sulphuric acid which combines with the potash and sets the nitric acid at liberty this i can easily show you by mixing some nitrat of potash and sulphuric acid in this retort and heating it over a lamp the nitric acid will come over in the form of vapour which we shall collect in a glass bell this acid diluted in water is commonly called aqua fortis if caroline will allow me to mention that name caroline i have often heard that aqua fortis will dissolve almost all metals it is no doubt because it yields its oxygen so easily mrs b yes and from this powerful solvent property it derived the name of aqua fortis or strong water do you not recollect that we oxydated and afterwards dissolved some copper in this acid emily if i remember right the nitrat of copper was the first instance you gave us of a compound salt caroline can the nitric acid be completely decomposed and converted into nitrogen and oxygen emily that cannot be the case caroline since the acid can be decomposed only by the combination of its constituents with other bodies mrs b true but caloric is sufficient for this purpose by making the acid pass through a red hot porcelain tube it is decomposed the nitrogen and oxygen regain the caloric which they had lost in combining and are thus both restored to their gaseous state the nitric acid may also be partly decomposed and is by this means converted into nitrous acid caroline this conversion must be easily effected as the oxygen is so slightly combined with the nitrogen mrs b the partial decomposition of nitric acid is readily effected by most metals but it is sufficient to expose the nitric acid to a very strong light to make it give out oxygen gas and thus be converted into nitrous acid of this acid there are various degrees according to the proportions of oxygen which it contains the strongest and that into which the nitric is first converted is of a yellow colour as you see in this bottle caroline how it fumes when the stopper is taken out mrs b the acid exists naturally in a gaseous state and is here so strongly concentrated in water that it is constantly escaping here is another bottle of nitrous acid which you see is of an orange red this acid is weaker the nitrogen being combined with a smaller quantity of oxygen and with a still less proportion of oxygen it is an olivegreen colour as it appears in this third bottle in short the weaker the acid the deeper is its colour nitrous acid acts still more powerfully on some inflammable substances than the nitric emily i am surprised at that as it contains less oxygen mrs b but on the other hand it parts with its oxygen much more readily you may recollect that we once inflamed oil with this acid the next combinations of nitrogen and oxygen form only oxyds of nitrogen the first of which is commonly called nitrous air or more properly nitric oxyd gas this may be obtained from nitric acid by exposing the latter to the action of metals as in dissolving them it does not yield the whole of its oxygen but retains a portion of this principle sufficient to convert it into this peculiar gas a specimen of which i have prepared and preserved within this inverted glass bell emily it is a perfectly invisible elastic fluid mrs b yes and it may be kept any length of time in this manner over water as it is not like the nitric and nitrous acids absorbable by it it is rather heavier than atmospherical air and is incapable of supporting either combustion or respiration i am going to incline the glass gently on one side so as to let some of the gas escape emily how very curious it produces orange fumes like the nitrous acid that is the more extraordinary as the gas within the glass is perfectly invisible mrs b it would give me much pleasure if you could make out the reason of this curious change without requiring any further explanation caroline it seems by the colour and smell as if it were converted into nitrous acid gas yet that cannot be unless it combines with more oxygen and how can it obtain oxygen the very instant it escapes from the glass emily from the atmosphere no doubt is it not so mrs b mrs b you have guessed it as soon as it comes in contact with the atmosphere it absorbs from it the additional quantity of oxygen necessary to convert it into nitrous acid gas and if i now remove the bottle entirely from the water so as to bring at once the whole of the gas into contact with the atmosphere this conversion will appear still more striking emily look caroline the whole capacity of the bottle is instantly tinged of an orange colour mrs b thus you see it is the most easy process imaginable to convert nitrous oxyd gas into nitrous acid gas the property of attracting oxygen from the atmosphere without any elevation of temperature has occasioned this gaseous oxyd being used as a test for ascertaining the degree of purity of the atmosphere i am going to show you how it is applied to this purpose you see this graduated glass tube which is closed at one end plate x fig 2 i first fill it with water and then introduce a certain measure of nitrous gas which not being absorbable by water passes through it and occupies the upper part of the tube i must now add rather above twothirds of oxygen gas which will just be sufficient to convert the nitrous oxyd gas into nitrous acid gas caroline so it has i saw it turn of an orange colour but it immediately afterwards disappeared entirely and the water you see has risen and almost filled the tube mrs b that is because the acid gas is absorbable by water and in proportion as the gas impregnates the water the latter rises in the tube when the oxygen gas is very pure and the required proportion of nitrous oxyd gas very exact the whole is absorbed by the water but if any other gas be mixed with the oxygen instead of combining with the nitrous oxygen it will remain and occupy the upper part of the tube or if the gases be not in the due proportion there will be a residue of that which predominates before we leave this subject i must not forget to remark that nitrous acid may be formed by dissolving nitrous oxyd gas in nitric acid this solution may be effected simply by making bubbles of nitrous oxyd gas pass through nitric acid emily that is to say that nitrogen at its highest degree of oxygenation being mixed with nitrogen at its lowest degree of oxygenation will produce a kind of intermediate substance which is nitrous acid mrs b you have stated the fact with great precision there are various other methods of preparing nitrous oxyd and of obtaining it from compound bodies but it is not necessary to enter into these particulars it remains for me only to mention another curious modification of oxygenated nitrogen which has been distinguished by the name of gaseous oxyd of nitrogen it is but lately that this gas has been accurately examined and its properties have been investigated chiefly by sir h davy it has obtained also the name of exhilarating gas from the very singular property which that gentleman has discovered in it of elevating the animal spirits when inhaled into the lungs to a degree sometimes resembling delirium or intoxication caroline is it respirable then mrs b it can scarcely be called respirable as it would not support life for any length of time but it may be breathed for a few moments without any other effects than the singular exhilaration of spirits i have just mentioned it affects different people however in a very different manner some become violent even outrageous others experience a languor attended with faintness but most agree in opinion that the sensations it excites are extremely pleasant caroline i think i should like to try ithow do you breathe it mrs b by collecting the gas in a bladder to which a short tube with a stopcock is adapted this is applied to the mouth with one hand whilst the nostrils are kept closed with the other that the common air may have no access you then alternately inspire and expire the gas till you perceive its effects but i cannot consent to your making the experiment for the nerves are sometimes unpleasantly affected by it and i would not run any risk of that kind emily i should like at least to see somebody breathe it but pray by what means is this curious gas obtained mrs b it is procured from nitrat of ammonia an artificial salt which yields this gas on the application of a gentle heat i have put some of the salt into a retort and by the aid of a lamp the gas will be extricated caroline bubbles of air begin to escape through the neck of the retort into the water apparatus will you not collect them mrs b the gas that first comes over need not be preserved as it consists of little more than the common air that was in the retort besides there is always in this experiment a quantity of watery vapour which must come away before the nitrous oxyd appears emily watery vapour whence does that proceed there is no water in nitrat of ammonia mrs b you must recollect that there is in every salt a quantity of water of crystallisation which may be evaporated by heat alone but besides this water is actually generated in this experiment as you will see presently first tell me what are the constituent parts of nitrat of ammonia emily ammonia and nitric acid this salt therefore contains three different elements nitrogen and hydrogen which produce the ammonia and oxygen which with nitrogen forms the acid mrs b well then in this process the ammonia is decomposed the hydrogen quits the nitrogen to combine with some of the oxygen of the nitric acid and forms with it the watery vapour which is now coming over when that is effected what will you expect to find emily nitrous acid instead of nitric acid and nitrogen instead of ammonia mrs b exactly so and the nitrous acid and nitrogen combine and form the gaseous oxyd of nitrogen in which the proportion of oxygen is 37 parts to 63 of nitrogen you may have observed that for a little while no bubbles of air have come over and we have perceived only a stream of vapour condensing as it issued into the water now bubbles of air again make their appearance and i imagine that by this time all the watery vapour is come away and that we may begin to collect the gas we may try whether it is pure by filling a phial with it and plunging a taper into ityes it will do now for the taper burns brighter than in the common air and with a greenish flame caroline but how is that i thought no gas would support combustion but oxygen or chlorine mrs b or any gas that contains oxygen and is ready to yield it which is the case with this in a considerable degree it is not therefore surprising that it should accelerate the combustion of the taper you see that the gas is now produced in great abundance we shall collect a large quantity of it and i dare say that we shall find some of the family who will be curious to make the experiment of respiring it whilst this process is going on we may take a general survey of the most important combinations of the nitric and nitrous acids with the alkalies the first of these is nitrat of potash commonly called nitre or saltpetre caroline is not that the salt with which gunpowder is made mrs b yes gunpowder is a mixture of five parts of nitre to one of sulphur and one of charcoal nitre from its great proportion of oxygen and from the facility with which it yields it is the basis of most detonating compositions emily but what is the cause of the violent detonation of gunpowder when set fire to mrs b detonation may proceed from two causes the sudden formation or destruction of an elastic fluid in the first case when either a solid or liquid is instantaneously converted into an elastic fluid the prodigious and sudden expansion of the body strikes the air with great violence and this concussion produces the sound called detonation caroline that i comprehend very well but how can a similar effect be produced by the destruction of a gas mrs b a gas can be destroyed only by condensing it to a liquid or solid state when this takes place suddenly the gas in assuming a new and more compact form produces a vacuum into which the surrounding air rushes with great impetuosity and it is by that rapid and violent motion that the sound is produced in all detonations therefore gases are either suddenly formed or destroyed in that of gunpowder can you tell me which of these two circumstances takes place emily as gunpowder is a solid it must of course produce the gases in its detonation but how i cannot tell mrs b the constituents of gunpowder when heated to a certain degree enter into a number of new combinations and are instantaneously converted into a variety of gases the sudden expansion of which gives rise to the detonation caroline and in what instance does the destruction or condensation of gases produce detonation mrs b i can give you one with which you are well acquainted the sudden combination of the oxygen and hydrogen gases caroline true i recollect perfectly that hydrogen detonates with oxygen when the two gases are converted into water mrs b but let us return to the nitrat of potash this salt is decomposed when exposed to heat and mixed with any combustible body such as carbon sulphur or metals these substances oxydating rapidly at the expense of the nitrat i must show you an instance of this i expose to the fire some of the salt in a small iron ladle and when it is sufficiently heated add to it some powdered charcoal this will attract the oxygen from the salt and be converted into carbonic acid emily but what occasions that crackling noise and those vivid flashes that accompany it mrs b the rapidity with which the carbonic acid gas is formed occasions a succession of small detonations which together with the emission of flame is called deflagration nitrat of ammonia we have already noticed on account of the gaseous oxyd of nitrogen which is obtained from it nitrat of silver is the lunar caustic so remarkable for its property of destroying animal fibre for which purpose it is often used by surgeons we have said so much on a former occasion on the mode in which caustics act on animal matter that i shall not detain you any longer on this subject we now come to the carbonic acid which we have already had many opportunities of noticing you recollect that this acid may be formed by the combustion of carbon whether in its imperfect state of charcoal or in its purest form of diamond and it is not necessary for this purpose to burn the carbon in oxygen gas as we did in the preceding lecture for you need only light a piece of charcoal and suspend it under a receiver on the water bath the charcoal will soon be extinguished and the air in the receiver will be found mixed with carbonic acid the process however is much more expeditious if the combustion be performed in pure oxygen gas caroline but how can you separate the carbonic acid obtained in this manner from the air with which it is mixed mrs b the readiest mode is to introduce under the receiver a quantity of caustic lime or caustic alkali which soon attracts the whole of the carbonic acid to form a carbonat the alkali is found increased in weight and the volume of the air is diminished by a quantity equal to that of the carbonic acid which was mixed with it emily pray is there no method of obtaining pure carbon from carbonic acid mrs b for a long time it was supposed that carbonic acid was not decompoundable but mr tennant discovered a few years ago that this acid may be decomposed by burning phosphorus in a closed vessel with carbonat of soda or carbonat of lime the phosphorus absorbs the oxygen from the carbonat whilst the carbon is separated in the form of a black powder this decomposition however is not effected simply by the attraction of the phosphorus for oxygen since it is weaker than that of charcoal but the attraction of the alkali of lime for the phosphoric acid unites its power at the same time caroline cannot we make that experiment mrs b not easily it requires being performed with extreme nicety in order to obtain any sensible quantity of carbon and the experiment is much too delicate for me to attempt it but there can be no doubt of the accuracy of mr tennants results and all chemists now agree that one hundred parts of carbonic acid gas consists of about twentyeight parts of carbon to seventytwo of oxygen gas but if you recollect we decomposed carbonic acid gas the other day by burning potassium in it caroline true so we did and found the carbon precipitated on the regenerated potash mrs b carbonic acid gas is found very abundantly in nature it is supposed to form about one thousandth part of the atmosphere and is constantly produced by the respiration of animals it exists in a great variety of combinations and is exhaled from many natural decompositions it is contained in a state of great purity in certain caves such as the grotto del cane near naples emily i recollect having read an account of that grotto and of the cruel experiments made on the poor dogs to gratify the curiosity of strangers but i understood that the vapour exhaled by this cave was called fixed air mrs b that is the name by which carbonic acid was known before its chemical composition was discovered this gas is more destructive of life than any other and if the poor animals that are submitted to its effects are not plunged into cold water as soon as they become senseless they do not recover it extinguishes flame instantaneously i have collected some in this glass which i will pour over the candle caroline this is extremely singularit seems to extinguish it as it were by enchantment as the gas is invisible i never should have imagined that gas could have been poured like a liquid mrs b it can be done with carbonic acid only as no other gas is sufficiently heavy to be susceptible of being poured out in the atmospherical air without mixing with it emily pray by what means did you obtain this gas mrs b i procured it from marble carbonic acid gas has so strong an attraction for all the alkalies and alkaline earths that these are always found in nature in the state of carbonats combined with lime this acid forms chalk which may be considered as the basis of all kinds of marbles and calcareous stones from these substances carbonic acid is easily separated as it adheres so slightly to its combinations that the carbonats are all decomposable by any of the other acids i can easily show you how i obtained this gas i poured some diluted sulphuric acid over pulverised marble in this bottle the same which we used the other day to prepare hydrogen gas and the gas escaped through the tube connected with it the operation still continues as you may easily perceive emily yes it does there is a great fermentation in the glass vessel what singular commotion is excited by the sulphuric acid taking possession of the lime and driving out the carbonic acid caroline but did the carbonic acid exist in a gaseous state in the marble mrs b certainly not the acid when in a state of combination is capable of existing in a solid form caroline whence then does it obtain the caloric necessary to convert it into gas mrs b it may be supplied in this case from the mixture of sulphuric acid and water which produces an evolution of heat even greater than is required for the purpose since as you may perceive by touching the glass vessel a considerable quantity of the caloric disengaged becomes sensible but a supply of caloric may be obtained also from a diminution of capacity for heat occasioned by the new combination which takes place and indeed this must be the case when other acids are employed for the disengagement of carbonic acid gas which do not like the sulphuric produce heat on being mixed with water carbonic acid may likewise be disengaged from its combinations by heat alone which restores it to its gaseous state caroline it appears to me very extraordinary that the same gas which is produced by the burning of wood and coals should exist also in such bodies as marble and chalk which are incombustible substances mrs b i will not answer that objection caroline because i think i can put you in a way of doing it yourself is carbonic acid combustible caroline why nobecause it is a body that has been already burnt it is carbon only and not the acid that is combustible mrs b well and what inference do you draw from this caroline that carbonic acid cannot render the bodies with which it is united combustible but that simple carbon does and that it is in this elementary state that it exists in wood coals and a great variety of other combustible bodies indeed mrs b you are very ungenerous you are not satisfied with convincing me that my objections are frivolous but you oblige me to prove them so myself mrs b you must confess however that i make ample amends for the detection of error when i enable you to discover the truth you understand now i hope that carbonic acid is equally produced by the decomposition of chalk or by the combustion of charcoal these processes are certainly of a very different nature in the first case the acid is already formed and requires nothing more than heat to restore it to its gaseous state whilst in the latter the acid is actually made by the process of combustion caroline i understand it now perfectly but i have just been thinking of another difficulty which i hope you will excuse my not being able to remove myself how does the immense quantity of calcareous earth which is spread all over the globe obtain the carbonic acid with which it is combined mrs b the question is indeed not very easy to answer but i conceive that the general carbonisation of calcareous matter may have been the effect of a general combustion occasioned by some revolution of our globe and producing an immense supply of carbonic acid with which the calcareous matter became impregnated or that this may have been effected by a gradual absorption of carbonic acid from the atmosphere but this would lead us to discussions which we cannot indulge in without deviating too much from our subject emily how does it happen that we do not perceive the pernicious effects of the carbonic acid which is floating in the atmosphere mrs b because of the state of very great dilution in which it exists there but can you tell me emily what are the sources which keep the atmosphere constantly supplied with this acid emily i suppose the combustion of wood coals and other substances that contain carbon mrs b and also the breath of animals caroline the breath of animals i thought you said that this gas was not at all respirable but on the contrary extremely poisonous mrs b so it is but although animals cannot breathe in carbonic acid gas yet in the process of respiration they have the power of forming this gas in their lungs so that the air which we expire or reject from the lungs always contains a certain proportion of carbonic acid which is much greater than that which is commonly found in the atmosphere caroline but what is it that renders carbonic acid such a deadly poison mrs b the manner in which this gas destroys life seems to be merely by preventing the access of respirable air for carbonic acid gas unless very much diluted with common air does not penetrate into the lungs as the windpipe actually contracts and refuses it admittance but we must dismiss this subject at present as we shall have an opportunity of treating of respiration much more fully when we come to the chemical functions of animals emily is carbonic acid as destructive to the life of vegetables as it is to that of animals mrs b if a vegetable be completely immersed in it i believe it generally proves fatal to it but mixed in certain proportions with atmospherical air it is on the contrary very favourable to vegetation you remember i suppose our mentioning the mineral waters both natural and artificial which contain carbonic acid gas caroline you mean the seltzer water mrs b that is one of those which are the most used there are however a variety of others into which carbonic acid enters as an ingredient all these waters are usually distinguished by the name of acidulous or gaseous mineral waters the class of salts called carbonats is the most numerous in nature we must pass over them in a very cursory manner as the subject is far too extensive for us to enter on it in detail the state of carbonat is the natural state of a vast number of minerals and particularly of the alkalies and alkaline earths as they have so great an attraction for the carbonic acid that they are almost always found combined with it and you may recollect that it is only by separating them from this acid that they acquire that causticity and those striking qualities which i have formerly described all marbles chalks shells calcareous spars and limestones of every description are neutral salts in which lime their common basis has lost all its characteristic properties emily but if all these various substances are formed by the union of lime with carbonic acid whence arises their diversity of form and appearance mrs b both from the different proportions of their component parts and from a variety of foreign ingredients which may be occasionally blended with them the veins and colours of marbles for instance proceed from a mixture of metallic substances silex and alumine also frequently enter into these combinations the various carbonats therefore that i have enumerated cannot be considered as pure unadulterated neutral salts although they certainly belong to that class of bodies conversation xix on the boracic fluoric muriatic and oxygenated muriatic acids and on muriats on iodine and iodic acid mrs b we now come to the three remaining acids with simple bases the compound nature of which though long suspected has been but recently proved the chief of these is the muriatic but i shall first describe the two others as their bases have been obtained more distinctly than that of the muriatic acid you may recollect i mentioned the boracic acid this is found very sparingly in some parts of europe but for the use of manufactures we have always received it from the remote country of thibet where it is found in some lakes combined with soda it is easily separated from the soda by sulphuric acid and appears in the form of shining scales as you see here caroline i am glad to meet with an acid which we need not be afraid to touch for i perceive from your keeping it in a piece of paper that it is more innocent than our late acquaintance the sulphuric and nitric acids mrs b certainly but being more inert you will not find its properties so interesting however its decomposition and the brilliant spectacle it affords when its basis again unites with oxygen atones for its want of other striking qualities sir h davy succeeded in decomposing the boracic acid which had till then been considered as undecompoundable by various methods on exposing this acid to the voltaic battery the positive wire gave out oxygen and on the negative wire was deposited a black substance in appearance resembling charcoal this was the basis of the acid which sir h davy has called boracium or boron the same substance was obtained in more considerable quantities by exposing the acid to a great heat in an iron gunbarrel a third method of decomposing the boracic acid consisted in burning potassium in contact with it in vacuo the potassium attracts the oxygen from the acid and leaves its basis in a separate state the recomposition of this acid i shall show you by burning some of its basis which you see here in a retort full of oxygen gas the heat of a candle is all that is required for this combustion emily the light is astonishingly brilliant and what beautiful sparks it throws out mrs b the result of this combustion is the boracic acid the nature of which you see is proved both by analytic and synthetic means its basis has not it is true a metallic appearance but it makes very hard alloys with other metals emily but pray mrs b for what purpose is the boracic acid used in manufactures mrs b its principal use is in conjunction with soda that is in the state of borat of soda which in the arts is commonly called borax this salt has a peculiar power of dissolving metallic oxyds and of promoting the fusion of substances capable of being melted it is accordingly employed in various metallic arts it is used for example to remove the oxyd from the surface of metals and is often employed in the assaying of metallic ores let us now proceed to the fluoric acid this acid is obtained from a substance which is found frequently in mines and particularly in those of derbyshire called fluor a name which it acquired from the circumstance of its being used to render the ores of metals more fluid when heated caroline pray is not this the derbyshire spar of which so many ornaments are made mrs b the same but though it has long been employed for a variety of purposes its nature was unknown until scheele the great swedish chemist discovered that it consisted of lime united with a peculiar acid which obtained the name of fluoric acid it is easily separated from the lime by the sulphuric acid and unless condensed in water ascends in the form of gas a very peculiar property of this acid is its union with siliceous earths which i have already mentioned if the distillation of this acid is performed in glass vessels they are corroded and the siliceous part of the glass comes over united with the gas if water is then admitted part of the silex is deposited as you may observe in this jar caroline i see white flakes forming on the surface of the water is that silex mrs b yes it is this power of corroding glass has been used for engraving or rather etching upon it the glass is first covered with a coat of wax through which the figures to be engraved are to be scratched with a pin then pouring the fluoric acid over the wax it corrodes the glass where the scratches have been made caroline i should like to have a bottle of this acid to make engravings mrs b but you could not have it in a glass bottle for in that case the acid would be saturated with silex and incapable of executing an engraving the same thing would happen were the acid kept in vessels of porcelain or earthenware this acid must therefore be both prepared and preserved in vessels of silver if it be distilled from fluor spar and vitriolic acid in silver or leaden vessels the receiver being kept very cold during the distillation it assumes the form of a dense fluid and in that state is the most intensely corrosive substance known this seems to be the acid combined with a little water it may be called hydrofluoric acid and sir h davy has been led from some late experiments on the subject to consider pure fluoric acid as a compound of a certain unknown principle which he calls fluorine with hydrogen sir h davy has also attempted to decompose the fluoric acid by burning potassium in contact with it but he has not yet been able by this or any other method to obtain its basis in a distinct separate state we shall conclude our account of the acids with that of the muriatic acid which is perhaps the most curious and interesting of all of them it is found in nature combined with soda lime and magnesia muriat of soda is the common seasalt and from this substance the acid is usually disengaged by means of the sulphuric acid the natural state of the muriatic acid is that of an invisible permanent gas at the common temperature of the atmosphere but it has a remarkably strong attraction for water and assumes the form of a whitish cloud whenever it meets any moisture to combine with this acid is remarkable for its peculiar and very pungent smell and possesses in a powerful degree most of the acid properties here is a bottle containing muriatic acid in a liquid state caroline and how is it liquefied mrs b by impregnating water with it its strong attraction for water makes it very easy to obtain it in a liquid form now if i open the phial you may observe a kind of vapour rising from it which is muriatic acid gas of itself invisible but made apparent by combining with the moisture of the atmosphere emily have you not any of the pure muriatic acid gas mrs b this jar is full of that acid in its gaseous stateit is inverted over mercury instead of water because being absorbable by water this gas cannot be confined by it i shall now raise the jar a little on one side and suffer some of the gas to escape you see that it immediately becomes visible in the form of a cloud emily it must be no doubt from its uniting with the moisture of the atmosphere that it is converted into this dewy vapour mrs b certainly and for the same reason that is to say its extreme eagerness to unite with water this gas will cause snow to melt as rapidly as an intense fire this acid proved much more refractory when sir h davy attempted to decompose it than the other two undecompounded acids it is singular that potassium will burn in muriatic acid and be converted into potash without decomposing the acid and the result of this combustion is a muriat of potash for the potash as soon as it is regenerated combines with the muriatic acid caroline but how can the potash be regenerated if the muriatic acid does not oxydate the potassium mrs b the potassium in this process obtains oxygen from the moisture with which the muriatic acid is always combined and accordingly hydrogen resulting from the decomposition of the moisture is invariably evolved emily but why not make these experiments with dry muriatic acid mrs b dry acids cannot be acted on by the voltaic battery because acids are nonconductors of electricity unless moistened in the course of a number of experiments which sir h davy made upon acids in a state of dryness he observed that the presence of water appeared always necessary to develop the acid properties so that acids are not even capable of reddening vegetable blues if they have been carefully deprived of moisture this remarkable circumstance led him to suspect that water instead of oxygen may be the acidifying principle but this he threw out rather as a conjecture than as an established point sir h davy obtained very curious results from burning potassium in a mixture of phosphorus and muriatic acid and also of sulphur and muriatic acid the latter detonates with great violence all his experiments however failed in presenting to his view the basis of the muriatic acid of which he was in search and he was at last induced to form an opinion respecting the nature of this acid which i shall presently explain emily is this acid susceptible of different degrees of oxygenation mrs b yes for though we cannot deoxygenate this acid yet we may add oxygen to it caroline why then is not the least degree of oxygenation of the acid called the muriatous and the higher degree the muriatic acid mrs b because instead of becoming like other acids more dense and more acid by an addition of oxygen it is rendered on the contrary more volatile more pungent but less acid and less absorbable by water these circumstances therefore seem to indicate the propriety of making an exception to the nomenclature the highest degree of oxygenation of this acid has been distinguished by the additional epithet of oxygenated or for the sake of brevity oxy so that it is called the oxygenated or oxymuriatic acid this likewise exists in a gaseous form at the temperature of the atmosphere it is also susceptible of being absorbed by water and can be congealed or solidified by a certain degree of cold emily and how do you obtain the oxymuriatic acid mrs b in various ways but it may be most conveniently obtained by distilling liquid muriatic acid over oxyd of manganese which supplies the acid with the additional oxygen one part of the acid being put into a retort with two parts of the oxyd of manganese and the heat of a lamp applied the gas is soon disengaged and may be received over water as it is but sparingly absorbed by it i have collected some in this jar caroline it is not invisible like the generality of gases for it is of a yellowish colour mrs b the muriatic acid extinguishes flame whilst on the contrary the oxymuriatic makes the flame larger and gives it a dark red colour can you account for this difference in the two acids emily yes i think so the muriatic acid will not supply the flame with the oxygen necessary for its support but when this acid is further oxygenated it will part with its additional quantity of oxygen and in this way support combustion mrs b that is exactly the case indeed the oxygen added to the muriatic acid adheres so slightly to it that it is separated by mere exposure to the suns rays this acid is decomposed also by combustible bodies many of which it burns and actually inflames without any previous increase of temperature caroline that is extraordinary indeed i hope you mean to indulge us with some of these experiments mrs b i have prepared several glass jars of oxymuriatic acid gas for that purpose in the first we shall introduce some dutch gold leaf do you observe that it takes fire emily yes indeed it doeshow wonderful it is it became immediately red hot but was soon smothered in a thick vapour caroline what a disagreeable smell mrs b we shall try the same experiment with phosphorus in another jar of this acid you had better keep your handkerchief to your nose when i open itnow let us drop into it this little piece of phosphorus caroline it burns really and almost as brilliantly as in oxygen gas but what is most extraordinary these combustions take place without the metal or phosphorus being previously lighted or even in the least heated mrs b all these curious effects are owing to the very great facility with which this acid yields oxygen to such bodies as are strongly disposed to combine with it it appears extraordinary indeed to see bodies and metals in particular melted down and inflamed by a gas without any increase of temperature either of the gas or of the combustible the phenomenon however is you see well accounted for emily why did you burn a piece of dutch gold leaf rather than a piece of any other metal mrs b because in the first place it is a composition of metals consisting chiefly of copper which burns readily and i use a thin metallic leaf in preference to a lump of metal because it offers to the action of the gas but a small quantity of matter under a large surface filings or shavings would answer the purpose nearly as well but a lump of metal though the surface would oxydate with great rapidity would not take fire pure gold is not inflamed by oxymuriatic acid gas but it is rapidly oxydated and dissolved by it indeed this acid is the only one that will dissolve gold emily this i suppose is what is commonly called aqua regia which you know is the only thing that will act upon gold mrs b that is not exactly the case either for aqua regia is composed of a mixture of muriatic acid and nitric acid but in fact the result of this mixture is the formation of oxymuriatic acid as the muriatic acid oxygenates itself at the expence of the nitric this mixture therefore though it bears the name of nitromuriatic acid acts on gold merely in virtue of the oxymuriatic acid which it contains sulphur volatile oils and many other substances will burn in the same manner in oxymuriatic acid gas but i have not prepared a sufficient quantity of it to show you the combustion of all these bodies caroline there are several jars of the gas yet remaining mrs b we must reserve these for future experiments the oxymuriatic acid does not like other acids redden the blue vegetable colours but it totally destroys any colour and turns all vegetables perfectly white let us collect some vegetable substances to put into this glass which is full of gas emily here is a sprig of myrtle caroline and here some coloured paper mrs b we shall also put in this piece of scarlet riband and a rose emily their colours begin to fade immediately but how does the gas produce this effect mrs b the oxygen combines with the colouring matter of these substances and destroys it that is to say destroys the property which these colours had of reflecting only one kind of rays and renders them capable of reflecting them all which you know will make them appear white old prints may be cleaned by this acid for the paper will be whitened without injury to the impression as printers ink is made of materials oil and lamp black which are not acted upon by acids this property of the oxymuriatic acid has lately been employed in manufactures in a variety of bleaching processes but for these purposes the gas must be dissolved in water as the acid is thus rendered much milder and less powerful in its effects for in a gaseous state it would destroy the texture as well as the colour of the substance submitted to its action caroline look at the things which we put into the gas they have now entirely lost their colour mrs b the effect of the acid is almost completed and if we were to examine the quantity that remains we should find it to consist chiefly of muriatic acid the oxymuriatic acid has been used to purify the air in fever hospitals and prisons as it burns and destroys putrid effluvia of every kind the infection of the smallpox is likewise destroyed by this gas and matter that has been submitted to its influence will no longer generate that disorder caroline indeed i think the remedy must be nearly as bad as the disease the oxymuriatic acid has such a dreadfully suffocating smell mrs b it is certainly extremely offensive but by keeping the mouth shut and wetting the nostrils with liquid ammonia in order to neutralize the vapour as it reaches the nose its prejudicial effects may be in some degree prevented at any rate however this mode of disinfection can hardly be used in places that are inhabited and as the vapour of nitric acid which is scarcely less efficacious for this purpose is not at all prejudicial it is usually preferred on such occasions caroline you have not told us yet what is sir h davys new opinion respecting the nature of muriatic acid to which you alluded a few minutes ago mrs b true i avoided noticing it then because you could not have understood it without some previous knowledge of the oxymuriatic acid which i have but just introduced to your acquaintance sir h davys idea is that muriatic acid instead of being a compound consisting of an unknown basis and oxygen is formed by the union of oxymuriatic gas with hydrogen emily have you not told us just now that oxymuriatic gas was itself a compound of muriatic acid and oxygen mrs b yes but according to sir h davys hypothesis oxymuriatic gas is considered as a simple body which contains no oxygenas a substance of its own kind which has a great analogy to oxygen in most of its properties though in others it differs entirely from it according to this view of the subject the name of oxymuriatic acid can no longer be proper and therefore sir h davy has adopted that of chlorine or chlorine gas a name which is simply expressive of its greenish colour and in compliance with that philosophers theory we have placed chlorine in our table among the simple bodies caroline but what was sir h davys reason for adopting an opinion so contrary to that which had hitherto prevailed mrs b there are many circumstances which are favourable to the new doctrine but the clearest and simplest fact in its support is that if hydrogen gas and oxymuriatic gas be mixed together both these gases disappear and muriatic acid gas is formed emily that seems to be a complete proof is it not considered as perfectly conclusive mrs b not so decisive as it appears at first sight because it is argued by those who still incline to the old doctrine that muriatic acid gas however dry it may be always contains a certain quantity of water which is supposed essential to its formation so that in the experiment just mentioned this water is supplied by the union of the hydrogen gas with the oxygen of the oxymuriatic acid and therefore the mixture resolves itself into the base of muriatic acid and water that is muriatic acid gas caroline i think the old theory must be the true one for otherwise how could you explain the formation of oxymuriatic gas from a mixture of muriatic acid and oxyd of manganese mrs b very easily you need only suppose that in this process the muriatic acid is decomposed its hydrogen unites with the oxygen of the manganese to form water and the chlorine appears in its separate state emily but how can you explain the various combustions which take place in oxymuriatic gas if you consider it as containing no oxygen mrs b we need only suppose that combustion is the result of intense chemical action so that chlorine like oxygen in combining with bodies forms compounds which have less capacity for caloric than their constituent principles and therefore caloric is evolved at the moment of their combination emily if then we may explain every thing by either theory to which of the two shall we give the preference mrs b it will perhaps be better to wait for more positive proofs if such can be obtained before we decide positively upon the subject the new doctrine has certainly gained ground very rapidly and may be considered as nearly established but several competent judges still refuse their assent to it and until that theory is very generally adopted it may be as well for us still occasionally to use the language to which chemists have long been accustomed but let us proceed to the examination of salts formed by muriatic acid among the compound salts formed by muriatic acid the muriat of soda or common salt is the most interesting the uses and properties of this salt are too well known to require much comment besides the pleasant flavour it imparts to the food it is very wholesome when not used to excess as it assists the process of digestion seawater is the great source from which muriat of soda is extracted by evaporation but it is also found in large solid masses in the bowels of the earth in england and in many other parts of the world footnote according to sir h davys views of the nature of the muriatic and oxymuriatic acids dry muriat of soda is a compound of sodium and chlorine for it may be formed by the direct combination of oxymuriatic gas and sodium in his opinion therefore what we commonly call muriat of soda contains neither soda nor muriatic acid emily i thought that salts when solid were always in the state of crystals but the common tablesalt is in the form of a coarse white powder mrs b crystallisation depends as you may recollect on the slow and regular reunion of particles dissolved in a fluid common seasalt is only in a state of imperfect crystallisation because the process by which it is prepared is not favourable to the formation of regular crystals but if you dissolve it and afterwards evaporate the water slowly you will obtain a regular crystallisation muriat of ammonia is another combination of this acid which we have already mentioned as the principal source from which ammonia is derived i can at once show you the formation of this salt by the immediate combination of muriatic acid with ammonia these two glass jars contain the one muriatic acid gas the other ammoniacal gas both of which are perfectly invisiblenow if i mix them together you see they immediately form an opake white cloud like smoke if a thermometer was placed in the jar in which these gases are mixed you would perceive that some heat is at the same time produced emily the effects of chemical combinations are indeed wonderful how extraordinary it is that two invisible bodies should become visible by their union mrs b this strikes you with astonishment because it is a phenomenon which nature seldom exhibits to our view but the most common of her operations are as wonderful and it is their frequency only that prevents our regarding them with equal admiration what would be more surprising for instance than combustion were it not rendered so familiar by custom emily that is true but pray mrs b is this white cloud the salt that produces ammonia how different it is from the solid muriat of ammonia which you once showed us mrs b it is the same substance which first appears in the state of vapour but will soon be condensed by cooling against the sides of the jar in the form of very minute crystals we may now proceed to the oxymuriats in this class of salts the oxymuriat of potash is the most worthy of our attention for its striking properties the acid in this state of combination contains a still greater proportion of oxygen than when alone caroline but how can the oxymuriatic acid acquire an increase of oxygen by combining with potash mrs b it does not really acquire an additional quantity of oxygen but it loses some of the muriatic acid which produces the same effect as the acid which remains is proportionably superoxygenated if this salt be mixed and merely rubbed together with sulphur phosphorus charcoal or indeed any other combustible it explodes strongly footnote according to sir h davys new views just explained oxymuriat of potash is a compound of chlorine with oxyd of potassium caroline like gunpowder i suppose it is suddenly converted into elastic fluids mrs b yes but with this remarkable difference that no increase of temperature any further than is produced by gentle friction is required in this instance can you tell me what gases are generated by the detonation of this salt with charcoal emily let me consider the oxymuriatic acid parts with its excess of oxygen to the charcoal by which means it is converted into muriatic acid gas whilst the charcoal being burnt by the oxygen is changed to carbonic acid gas what becomes of the potash i cannot tell mrs b that is a fixed product which remains in the vessel caroline but since the potash does not enter into the new combinations i do not understand of what use it is in this operation would not the oxymuriatic acid and the charcoal produce the same effect without it mrs b no because there would not be that very great concentration of oxygen which the combination with the potash produces as i have just explained i mean to show you this experiment but i would advise you not to repeat it alone for if care be not taken to mix only very small quantities at a time the detonation will be extremely violent and may be attended with dangerous effects you see i mix an exceedingly small quantity of the salt with a little powdered charcoal in this wedgwood mortar and rub them together with the pestle caroline heavens how can such a loud explosion be produced by so small a quantity of matter mrs b you must consider that an extremely small quantity of solid substance may produce a very great volume of gases and it is the sudden evolution of these which occasions the sound emily would not oxymuriat of potash make stronger gunpowder than nitrat of potash mrs b yes but the preparation as well as the use of this salt is attended with so much danger that it is never employed for that purpose caroline there is no cause to regret it i think for the common gunpowder is quite sufficiently destructive mrs b i can show you a very curious experiment with this salt but it must again be on condition that you will never attempt to repeat it by yourselves i throw a small piece of phosphorus into this glass of water then a little oxymuriat of potash and lastly i pour in by means of this funnel so as to bring it in contact with the two other ingredients at the bottom of the glass a small quantity of sulphuric acid caroline this is indeed a beautiful experiment the phosphorus takes fire and burns from the bottom of the water emily how wonderful it is to see flame bursting out under water and rising through it pray how is this accounted for mrs b cannot you find it out caroline emily stopi think i can explain it is it not because the sulphuric acid decomposes the salt by combining with the potash so as to liberate the oxymuriatic acid gas by which the phosphoric is set on fire mrs b very well emily and with a little more reflection you would have discovered another concurring circumstance which is that an increase of temperature is produced by the mixture of the sulphuric acid and water which assists in promoting the combustion of the phosphorus i must before we part introduce to your acquaintance the newlydiscovered substance iodine which you may recollect we placed next to oxygen and chlorine in our table of simple bodies caroline is this also a body capable of maintaining combustion like oxygen and chlorine mrs b it is and although it does not so generally disengage light and heat from inflammable bodies as oxygen and chlorine do yet it is capable of combining with most of them and sometimes as in the instance of potassium and phosphorus the combination is attended with an actual appearance of light and heat caroline but what sort of a substance is iodine what is its form and colour mrs b it is a very singular body in many respects at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere it commonly appears in the form of blueish black crystalline scales such as you see in this tube caroline they shine like black lead and some of the scales have the shape of lozenges mrs b that is actually the form which the crystals of iodine often assume but if we heat them gently by holding the tube over the flame of a candle see what a change takes place in them caroline how curious they seem to melt and the tube immediately fills with a beautiful violet vapour but look mrs b the same scales are now appearing at the other end of the tube mrs b this is in fact a sublimation of iodine from one part of the tube to another but with this remarkable peculiarity that while in the gaseous state iodine assumes that bright violet colour which as you may already perceive it loses as the tube cools and the substance resumes its usual solid form it is from the violet colour of the gas that iodine has obtained its name caroline but how is this curious substance obtained mrs b it is found in the ley of ashes of seaweeds after the soda has been separated by crystallisation and it is disengaged by means of sulphuric acid which expels it from the alkaline ley in the form of a violet gas which may be collected and condensed in the way you have just seen this interesting discovery was made in the year 1812 by m courtois a manufacturer of saltpetre at paris caroline and pray mrs b what is the proof of iodine being a simple body mrs b it is considered as a simple body both because it is not capable of being resolved into other ingredients and because it is itself capable of combining with other bodies in a manner analogous to oxygen and chlorine the most curious of these combinations is that which it forms with hydrogen gas the result of which is a peculiar gaseous acid caroline just as chlorine and hydrogen gas form muriatic acid in this respect chlorine and iodine seem to bear a strong analogy to each other mrs b that is indeed the case so that if the theory of the constitution of either of these two bodies be true it must be true also in regard to the other if erroneous in the one the theory must fall in both but it is now time to conclude we have examined such of the acids and salts as i conceived would appear to you most interesting i shall not enter into any particulars respecting the metallic acids as they offer nothing sufficiently striking for our present purpose conversation xx on the nature and composition of vegetables mrs b we have hitherto treated only of the simplest combinations of elements such as alkalies earths acids compound salts stones c all of which belong to the mineral kingdom it is time now to turn our attention to a more complicated class of compounds that of organised bodies which will furnish us with a new source of instruction and amusement emily by organised bodies i suppose you mean the vegetable and animal creation i have however but a very vague idea of the word organisation and i have often wished to know more precisely what it means mrs b organised bodies are such as are endowed by nature with various parts peculiarly constructed and adapted to perform certain functions connected with life thus you may observe that mineral compounds are formed by the simple effect of mechanical or chemical attraction and may appear to some to be in a great measure the productions of chance whilst organised bodies bear the most striking and impressive marks of design and are eminently distinguished by that unknown principle called life from which the various organs derive the power of exercising their respective functions caroline but in what manner does life enable these organs to perform their several functions mrs b that is a mystery which i fear is enveloped in such profound darkness that there is very little hope of our ever being able to unfold it we must content ourselves with examining the effects of this principle as for the cause we have been able only to give it a name without attaching any other meaning to it than the vague and unsatisfactory idea of au unknown agent caroline and yet i think i can form a very clear idea of life mrs b pray let me hear how you would define it caroline it is perhaps more easy to conceive than to expresslet me consider is not life the power which enables both the animal and the vegetable creation to perform the various functions which nature has assigned to them mrs b i have nothing to object to your definition but you will allow me to observe that you have only mentioned the effects which the unknown cause produces without giving us any notion of the cause itself emily yes caroline you have told us what life does but you have not told us what it is mrs b we may study its operations but we should puzzle ourselves to no purpose by attempting to form an idea of its real nature we shall begin with examining its effects in the vegetable world which constitutes the simplest class of organised bodies these we shall find distinguished from the mineral creation not only by their more complicated nature but by the power which they possess within themselves of forming new chemical arrangements of their constituent parts by means of appropriate organs thus though all vegetables are ultimately composed of hydrogen carbon and oxygen with a few other occasional ingredients they separate and combine these principles by their various organs in a thousand ways and form with them different kinds of juices and solid parts which exist ready made in vegetables and may therefore be considered as their immediate materials these are sap mucilage sugar fecula gluten fixed oil volatile oil camphor resins gum resins balsams caoutchouc extractive colouring matter tannin woody fibre vegetable acids c caroline what a long list of names i did not suppose that a vegetable was composed of half so many ingredients mrs b you must not imagine that every one of these materials is formed in each individual plant i only mean to say that they are all derived exclusively from the vegetable kingdom emily but does each particular part of the plant such as the root the bark the stem the seeds the leaves consist of one of these ingredients only or of several of them combined together mrs b i believe there is no part of a plant which can be said to consist solely of any one particular ingredient a certain number of vegetable materials must always be combined for the formation of any particular part of a seed for instance and these combinations are carried on by sets of vessels or minute organs which select from other parts and bring together the several principles required for the development and growth of those particular parts which they are intended to form and to maintain emily and are not these combinations always regulated by the laws of chemical attraction mrs b no doubt the organs of plants cannot force principles to combine that have no attraction for each other nor can they compel superior attractions to yield to those of inferior power they probably act rather mechanically by bringing into contact such principles and in such proportions as will by their chemical combination form the various vegetable products caroline we may then consider each of these organs as a curiously constructed apparatus adapted for the performance of a variety of chemical processes mrs b exactly so as long as the plant lives and thrives the carbon hydrogen and oxygen the chief constituents of its immediate materials are so balanced and connected together that they are not susceptible of entering into other combinations but no sooner does death take place than this state of equilibrium is destroyed and new combinations produced emily but why should death destroy it for these principles must remain in the same proportions and consequently i should suppose in the same order of attractions mrs b you must remember that in the vegetable as well as in the animal kingdom it is by the principle of life that the organs are enabled to act when deprived of that agent or stimulus their power ceases and an order of attractions succeeds similar to that which would take place in mineral or unorganised matter emily it is this new order of attractions i suppose that destroys the organisation of the plant after death for if the same combinations still continued to prevail the plant would always remain in the state in which it died mrs b and that you know is never the case plants may be partially preserved for some time after death by drying but in the natural course of events they all return to the state of simple elements a wise and admirable dispensation of providence by which dead plants are rendered fit to enrich the soil and become subservient to the nourishment of living vegetables caroline but we are talking of the dissolution of plants before we have examined them in their living state mrs b that is true my dear but i wished to give you a general idea of the nature of vegetation before we entered into particulars besides it is not so irrelevant as you suppose to talk of vegetables in their dead state since we cannot analyse them without destroying life and it is only by hastening to submit them to examination immediately after they have ceased to live that we can anticipate their natural decomposition there are two kinds of analysis of which vegetables are susceptible first that which separates them into their immediate materials such as sap resin mucilage c secondly that which decomposes them into their primitive elements as carbon hydrogen and oxygen emily is there not a third kind of analysis of plants which consists in separating their various parts as the stem the leaves and the several organs of the flower mrs b that my dear is rather the department of the botanist we shall consider these different parts of plants only as the organs by which the various secretions or separations are performed but we must first examine the nature of these secretions the sap is the principal material of vegetables since it contains the ingredients that nourish every part of the plant the basis of this juice which the roots suck up from the soil is water this holds in solution the various other ingredients required by the several parts of the plant which are gradually secreted from the sap by the different organs appropriated to that purpose as it passes them in circulating through the plant mucus or mucilage is a vegetable substance which like all the others is secreted from the sap when in excess it exudes from trees in the form of gum caroline is that the gum so frequently used instead of paste or glue mrs b it is almost all fruittrees yield some sort of gum but that most commonly used in the arts is obtained from a species of acaciatree in arabia and is called gum arabic it forms the chief nourishment of the natives of those parts who obtain it in great quantities from incisions which they make in the trees caroline i did not know that gum was eatable mrs b there is an account of a whole ships company being saved from starving by feeding on the cargo which was gum senegal i should not however imagine that it would be either a pleasant or a particularly eligible diet to those who have not from their birth been accustomed to it it is however frequently taken medicinally and considered as very nourishing several kinds of vegetable acids may be obtained by particular processes from gum or mucilage the principal of which is called the mucous acid sugar is not found in its simple state in plants but is always mixed with gum sap or other ingredients this saccharine matter is to be met with in every vegetable but abounds most in roots fruits and particularly in the sugarcane emily if all vegetables contain sugar why is it extracted exclusively from the sugarcane mrs b because it is both most abundant in that plant and most easily obtained from it besides the sugars produced by other vegetables differ a little in their nature during the late troubles in the westindies when europe was but imperfectly supplied with sugar several attempts were made to extract it from other vegetables and very good sugar was obtained from parsnips and from carrots but the process was too expensive to carry this enterprize to any extent caroline i should think that sugar might be more easily obtained from sweet fruits such as figs dates c mrs b probably but it would be still more expensive from the high price of those fruits emily pray in what manner is sugar obtained from the sugarcane mrs b the juice of this plant is first expressed by passing it between two cylinders of iron it is then boiled with limewater which makes a thick scum rise to the surface the clarified liquor is let off below and evaporated to a very small quantity after which it is suffered to crystallise by standing in a vessel the bottom of which is perforated with holes that are imperfectly stopped in order that the syrup may drain off the sugar obtained by this process is a coarse brown powder commonly called raw or moist sugar it undergoes another operation to be refined and converted into loaf sugar for this purpose it is dissolved in water and afterwards purified by an animal fluid called albumen white of eggs chiefly consist of this fluid which is also one of the constituent parts of blood and consequently eggs or bullocks blood are commonly used for this purpose the albuminous fluid being diffused through the syrup combines with all the solid impurities contained in it and rises with them to the surface where it forms a thick scum the clear liquor is then again evaporated to a proper consistence and poured into moulds in which by a confused crystallisation it forms loafsugar but an additional process is required to whiten it to this effect the mould is inverted and its open base is covered with clay through which water is made to pass the water slowly trickling through the sugar combines with and carries off the colouring matter caroline i am very glad to hear that the blood that is used to purify sugar does not remain in it it would be a disgusting idea i have heard of some improvements by the late mr howard in the process of refining sugar pray what are they mrs b it would be much too long to give you an account of the process in detail but the principal improvement relates to the mode of evaporating the syrup in order to bring it to the consistency of sugar instead of boiling the syrup in a large copper over a strong fire mr howard carries off the water by means of a large airpump in a way similar to that used in mr leslies experiment for freezing water by evaporation that is the syrup being exposed to a vacuum the water evaporates quickly with no greater heat than that of a little steam which is introduced round the boiler the airpump is of course of large dimensions and is worked by a steam engine a great saving is thus obtained and a striking instance afforded of the power of science in suggesting useful economical improvements emily and pray how is sugarcandy and barleysugar prepared mrs b candied sugar is nothing more than the regular crystals obtained by slow evaporation from a solution of sugar barleysugar is sugar melted by heat and afterwards cooled in moulds of a spiral form sugar may be decomposed by a red heat and like all other vegetable substances resolved into carbonic acid and hydrogen the formation and the decomposition of sugar afford many very interesting particulars which we shall fully examine after having gone through the other materials of vegetables we shall find that there is reason to suppose that sugar is not like the other materials secreted from the sap by appropriate organs but that it is formed by a peculiar process with which you are not yet acquainted caroline pray is not honey of the same nature as sugar mrs b honey is a mixture of saccharine matter and gum emily i thought that honey was in some measure an animal substance as it is prepared by the bees mrs b it is rather collected by them from flowers and conveyed to their storehouses the hives it is the wax only that undergoes a real alteration in the body of the bee and is thence converted into an animal substance manna is another kind of sugar which is united with a nauseous extractive matter to which it owes its peculiar taste and colour it exudes like gum from various trees in hot climates some of which have their leaves glazed by it the next of the vegetable materials is fecula this is the general name given to the farinaceous substance contained in all seeds and in some roots as the potatoe parsnip c it is intended by nature for the first aliment of the young vegetable but that of one particular grain is become a favourite and most common food of a large part of mankind emily you allude i suppose to bread which is made of wheatflower mrs b yes the fecula of wheat contains also another vegetable substance which seems peculiar to that seed or at least has not as yet been obtained from any other this is gluten which is of a sticky ropy elastic nature and it is supposed to be owing to the viscous qualities of this substance that wheatflour forms a much better paste than any other emily gluten by your description must be very like gum mrs b in their sticky nature they certainly have some resemblance but gluten is essentially different from gum in other points and especially in its being insoluble in water whilst gum you know is extremely soluble the oils contained in vegetables all consist of hydrogen and carbon in various proportions they are of two kinds fixed and volatile both of which we formerly mentioned do you remember in what the difference between fixed and volatile oil consists emily if i recollect rightly the former are decomposed by heat whilst the latter are merely volatilised by it mrs b very well fixed oil is contained only in the seeds of plants excepting in the olive in which it is produced in and expressed from the fruit we have already observed that seeds contain also fecula these two substances united with a little mucilage form the white substance contained in the seeds or kernels of plants and is destined for the nourishment of the young plant to which the seed gives birth the milk of almonds which is expressed from the seed of that name is composed of these three substances emily pray of what nature is the linseed oil which is used in painting mrs b it is a fixed oil obtained from the seed of flax nut oil which is frequently used for the same purpose is expressed from walnuts olive oil is that which is best adapted to culinary purposes caroline and what are the oils used for burning mrs b animal oils most commonly but the preference given to them is owing to their being less expensive for vegetable oils burn equally well and are more pleasant as their smell is not offensive emily since oil is so good a combustible what is the reason that lamps so frequently require trimming mrs b this sometimes proceeds from the construction of the lamp which may not be sufficiently favourable to a perfect combustion but there is certainly a defect in the nature of oil itself which renders it necessary for the bestconstructed lamps to be occasionally trimmed this defect arises from a portion of mucilage which it is extremely difficult to separate from the oil and which being a bad combustible gathers round the wick and thus impedes its combustion and consequently dims the light caroline but will not oils burn without a wick mrs b not unless their temperature be elevated to five or six hundred degrees the wick answers this purpose as i think i once before explained to you the oil rises between the fibres of the cotton by capillary attraction and the heat of the burning wick volatilises it and brings it successively to the temperature at which it is combustible emily i suppose the explanation which you have given with regard to the necessity of trimming lamps applies also to candles which so often require snuffing mrs b i believe it does at least in some degree but besides the circumstance just explained the common sorts of oils are not very highly combustible so that the heat produced by a candle which is a coarse kind of animal oil being insufficient to volatilise them completely a quantity of soot is gradually deposited on the wick which dims the light and retards the combustion caroline wax candles then contain no incombustible matter since they do not require snuffing mrs b wax is a much better combustible than tallow but still not perfectly so since it likewise contains some particles that are unfit for burning but when these gather round the wick which in a wax light is comparatively small they weigh it down on one side and fall off together with the burnt part of the wick caroline as oils are such good combustibles i wonder that they should require so great an elevation of temperature before they begin to burn mrs b though fixed oils will not enter into actual combustion below the temperature of about four hundred degrees yet they will slowly absorb oxygen at the common temperature of the atmosphere hence arises a variety of changes in oils which modify their properties and uses in the arts if oil simply absorbs and combines with oxygen it thickens and changes to a kind of wax this change is observed to take place on the external parts of certain vegetables even during their life but it happens in many instances that the oil does not retain all the oxygen which it attracts but that part of it combines with or burns the hydrogen of the oil thus forming a quantity of water which gradually goes off by evaporation in this case the alteration of the oil consists not only in the addition of a certain quantity of oxygen but in the diminution of the hydrogen these oils are distinguished by the name of drying oils linseed poppy and nutoils are of this description emily i am well acquainted with drying oils as i continually use them in painting but i do not understand why the acquisition of oxygen on one hand and a loss of hydrogen on the other should render them drying mrs b this i conceive may arise from two reasons either from the oxygen which is added being less favourable to the state of fluidity than the hydrogen which is subtracted or from this additional quantity of oxygen giving rise to new combinations in consequence of which the most fluid parts of the oil are liberated and volatilised for the purpose of painting the drying quality of oil is further increased by adding a quantity of oxyd of lead to it by which means it is more rapidly oxygenated the rancidity of oil is likewise owing to their oxygenation in this case a new order of attraction takes place from which a peculiar acid is formed called the sebacic acid caroline since the nature and composition of oil is so well known pray could not oil be actually made by combining its principles mrs b that is by no means a necessary consequence for there are innumerable varieties of compound bodies which we can decompose although we are unable to reunite their ingredients this however is not the case with oil as it has very lately been discovered that it is possible to form oil by a peculiar process from the action of oxygenated muriatic acid gas on hydrocarbonate we now pass to the volatile or essential oils these form the basis of all the vegetable perfumes and are contained more or less in every part of the plant excepting the seed they are at least never found in that part of the seed which contains the embrio plant emily the smell of flowers then proceeds from volatile oil mrs b certainly but this oil is often most abundant in the rind of fruits as in oranges lemons c from which it may be extracted by the slightest pressure it is found also in the leaves of plants and even in the wood caroline is it not very plentiful in the leaves of mint and of thyme and all the sweetsmelling herbs mrs b yes remarkably so and in geranium leaves also which have a much more powerful odour than the flowers the perfume of sandal fans is an instance of its existence in wood in short all vegetable odours or perfumes are produced by the evaporation of particles of these volatile oils emily they are i suppose very light and of very thin consistence since they are so volatile mrs b they vary very much in this respect some of them being as thick as butter whilst others are as fluid as water in order to be prepared for perfumes or essences these oils are first properly purified and then either distilled with spirit of wine as in the case with lavender water or simply mixed with a large proportion of water as is often done with regard to peppermint frequently also these odoriferous waters are prepared merely by soaking the plants in water and distilling the water then comes over impregnated with the volatile oil caroline such waters are frequently used to take spots of grease out of cloth or silk how do they produce that effect mrs b by combining with the substance that forms these stains for volatile oils and likewise the spirit in which they are distilled will dissolve wax tallow spermaceti and resins if therefore the spot proceeds from any of these substances it will remove it insects of every kind have a great aversion to perfumes so that volatile oils are employed with success in museums for the preservation of stuffed birds and other species of animals caroline pray does not the powerful smell of camphor proceed from a volatile oil mrs b camphor seems to be a substance of its own kind remarkable by many peculiarities but if not exactly of the same nature as volatile oil it is at least very analogous to it it is obtained chiefly from the camphortree a species of laurel which grows in china and in the indian isles from the stem and roots of which it is extracted small quantities have also been distilled from thyme sage and other aromatic plants and it is deposited in pretty large quantities by some volatile oils after long standing it is extremely volatile and inflammable it is insoluble in water but is soluble in oils in which state as well as in its solid form it is frequently applied to medicinal purposes amongst the particular properties of camphor there is one too singular to be passed over in silence if you take a small piece of camphor and place it on the surface of a bason of pure water it will immediately begin to move round and round with great rapidity but if you pour into the bason a single drop of any odoriferous fluid it will instantly put a stop to this motion you can at any time try this very simple experiment but you must not expect that i shall be able to account for this phenomenon as nothing satisfactory has yet been advanced for its explanation caroline it is very singular indeed and i will certainly try the experiment pray what are resins which you just now mentioned mrs b they are volatile oils that have been acted on and peculiarly modified by oxygen caroline they are therefore oxygenated volatile oils mrs b not exactly for the process does not appear to consist so much in the oxygenation of the oil as in the combustion of a portion of its hydrogen and a small portion of its carbon for when resins are artificially made by the combination of volatile oils with oxygen the vessel in which the process is performed is bedewed with water and the air included within is loaded with carbonic acid emily this process must be in some respects similar to that for preparing drying oils mrs b yes and it is by this operation that both of them acquire a greater degree of consistence pitch tar and turpentine are the most common resins they exude from the pine and fir trees copal mastic and frankincense are also of this class of vegetable substances emily is it of these resins that the mastic and copal varnishes so much used in painting are made mrs b yes dissolved either in oil or in alcohol resins form varnishes from these solutions they may be precipitated by water in which they are insoluble this i can easily show you if you will pour some water into this glass of mastic varnish it will combine with the alcohol in which the resin is dissolved and the latter will be precipitated in the form of a white cloud emily it is so and yet how is it that pictures or drawings varnished with this solution may safely be washed with water mrs b as the varnish dries the alcohol evaporates and the dry varnish or resin which remains not being soluble in water will not be acted on by it there is a class of compound resins called gumresins which are precisely what their name denotes that is to say resins combined with mucilage myrrh and assaftida are of this description caroline is it possible that a substance of so disagreeable a smell as assaftida can be formed from a volatile oil mrs b the odour of volatile oils is by no means always grateful onions and garlic derive their smell from volatile oils as well as roses and lavender there is still another form under which volatile oils present themselves which is that of balsams these consist of resinous juices combined with a peculiar acid called the benzoic acid balsams appear to have been originally volatile oils the oxygenation of which has converted one part into a resin and the other part into an acid which combined together form a balsam such are the balsams of peru tolu c we shall now take leave of the oils and their various modifications and proceed to the next vegetable substance which is caoutchouc this is a white milky glutinous fluid which acquires consistence and blackens in drying in which state it forms the substance with which you are so well acquainted under the name of gumelastic caroline i am surprised to hear that gumelastic was ever white or ever fluid and from what vegetable is it procured mrs b it is obtained from two or three different species of trees in the eastindies and southamerica by making incisions in the stem the juice is collected as it trickles from these incisions and moulds of clay in the form of little bottles of gumelastic are dipped into it a layer of this juice adheres to the clay and dries on it and several layers are successively added by repeating this till the bottle is of sufficient thickness it is then beaten to break down the clay which is easily shaken out the natives of the countries where this substance is produced sometimes make shoes and boots of it by a similar process and they are said to be extremely pleasant and serviceable both from their elasticity and their being waterproof the substance which comes next in our enumeration of the immediate ingredients of vegetables is extractive matter this is a term which in a general sense may be applied to any substance extracted from vegetables but it is more particularly understood to relate to the extractive colouring matter of plants a great variety of colours are prepared from the vegetable kingdom both for the purposes of painting and of dying all the colours called lakes are of this description but they are less durable than mineral colours for by long exposure to the atmosphere they either darken or turn yellow emily i know that in painting the lakes are reckoned far less durable colours than the ochres but what is the reason of it mrs b the change which takes place in vegetable colours is owing chiefly to the oxygen of the atmosphere slowly burning their hydrogen and leaving in some measure the blackness of the carbon exposed such change cannot take place in ochre which is altogether a mineral substance vegetable colours have a stronger affinity for animal than for vegetable substances and this is supposed to be owing to a small quantity of nitrogen which they contain thus silk and worsted will take a much finer vegetable dye than linen and cotton caroline dying then is quite a chemical process mrs b undoubtedly the condition required to form a good dye is that the colouring matter should be precipitated or fixed on the substance to be dyed and should form a compound not soluble in the liquids to which it will probably be exposed thus for instance printed or dyed linens or cottons must be able to resist the action of soap and water to which they must necessarily be subject in washing and woollens and silks should withstand the action of grease and acids to which they may accidentally be exposed caroline but if linen and cotton have not a sufficient affinity for colouring matter how are they made to resist the action of washing which they always do when they are well printed mrs b when the substance to be dyed has either no affinity for the colouring matter or not sufficient power to retain it the combination is effected or strengthened by the intervention of a third substance called a mordant or basis the mordant must have a strong affinity both for the colouring matter and the substance to be dyed by which means it causes them to combine and adhere together caroline and what are the substances that perform the office of thus reconciling the two adverse parties mrs b the most common mordant is sulphat of alumine or alum oxyds of tin and iron in the state of compound salts are likewise used for that purpose tannin is another vegetable ingredient of great importance in the arts it is obtained chiefly from the bark of trees but it is found also in nutgalls and in some other vegetables emily is that the substance commonly called tan which is used in hothouses mrs b tan is the prepared bark in which the peculiar substance tannin is contained but the use of tan in hothouses is of much less importance than in the operation of tanning by which skin is converted into leather emily pray how is this operation performed mrs b various methods are employed for this purpose which all consist in exposing skin to the action of tannin or of substances containing this principle in sufficient quantities and disposed to yield it to the skin the most usual way is to infuse coarsely powdered oak bark in water and to keep the skin immersed in this infusion for a certain length of time during this process which is slow and gradual the skin is found to have increased in weight and to have acquired a considerable tenacity and impermeability to water this effect may be much accelerated by using strong saturations of the tanning principle which can be extracted from bark instead of employing the bark itself but this quick mode of preparation does not appear to make equally good leather tannin is contained in a great variety of astringent vegetable substances as galls the rosetree and wine but it is nowhere so plentiful as in bark all these substances yield it to water from which it may be precipitated by a solution of isinglass or glue with which it strongly unites and forms an insoluble compound hence its valuable property of combining with skin which consists chiefly of glue and of enabling it to resist the action of water emily might we not see that effect by pouring a little melted isinglass into a glass of wine which you say contains tannin mrs b yes i have prepared a solution of isinglass for that very purpose do you observe the thick muddy precipitate that is the tannin combined with the isinglass caroline this precipitate must then be of the same nature as leather mrs b it is composed of the same ingredients but the organisation and texture of the skin being wanting it has neither the consistence nor the tenacity of leather caroline one might suppose that men who drink large quantities of red wine stand a chance of having the coats of their stomachs converted into leather since tannin has so strong an affinity for skin mrs b it is not impossible but that the coats of their stomachs may be in some measure tanned or hardened by the constant use of this liquor but you must remember that where a number of other chemical agents are concerned and above all where life exists no certain chemical inference can be drawn i must not dismiss this subject without mentioning a recent discovery of mr hatchett which relates to it this gentleman found that a substance very similar to tannin possessing all its leading properties and actually capable of tanning leather may be produced by exposing carbon or any substance containing carbonaceous matter whether vegetable animal or mineral to the action of nitric acid caroline and is not this discovery very likely to be of use to manufactures mrs b that is very doubtful because tannin thus artificially prepared must probably always be more expensive than that which is obtained from bark but the fact is extremely curious as it affords one of those very rare instances of chemistry being able to imitate the proximate principles of organised bodies the last of the vegetable materials is woody fibre it is the hardest part of plants the chief source from which this substance is derived is wood but it is also contained more or less in every solid part of that plant it forms a kind of skeleton of the part to which it belongs and retains its shape after all the other materials have disappeared it consists chiefly of carbon united with a small proportion of salts and the other constituents common to all vegetables emily it is of woody fibre then that the common charcoal is made mrs b yes charcoal as you may recollect is obtained from wood by the separation of all its evaporable parts before we take leave of the vegetable materials it will be proper at least to enumerate the several vegetable acids which we either have had or may have occasion to mention i believe i formerly told you that their basis or radical was uniformly composed of hydrogen and carbon and that their difference consisted only in the various proportions of oxygen which they contained the following are the names of the vegetable acids the mucous acid obtained from gum or mucilage suberic from cork camphoric from camphor benzoic from balsams gallic from galls bark c malic from ripe fruits citric from lemon juice oxalic from sorrel succinic from amber tartarous from tartrit of potash acetic from vinegar they are all decomposable by heat soluble in water and turn vegetable blue colours red the succinic the tartarous and the acetous acids are the products of the decomposition of vegetables we shall therefore reserve their examination for a future period the oxalic acid distilled from sorrel is the highest term of vegetable acidification for if more oxygen be added to it it loses its vegetable nature and is resolved into carbonic acid and water therefore though all the other acids may be converted into the oxalic by an addition of oxygen the oxalic itself is not susceptible of a further degree of oxygenation nor can it be made by any chemical processes to return to a state of lower acidification to conclude this subject i have only to add a few words on the gallic acid caroline is not this the same acid before mentioned which forms ink by precipitating sulphat of iron from its solution mrs b yes though it is usually extracted from galls on account of its being most abundant in that vegetable substance it may also be obtained from a great variety of plants it constitutes what is called the astringent principle of vegetables it is generally combined with tannin and you will find that an infusion of tea coffee bark redwine or any vegetable substance that contains the astringent principle will make a black precipitate with a solution of sulphat of iron caroline but pray what are galls mrs b they are excrescences which grow on the bark of young oaks and are occasioned by an insect which wounds the bark of trees and lays its eggs in the aperture the lacerated vessels of the tree then discharge their contents and form an excrescence which affords a defensive covering for these eggs the insect when come to life first feeds on this excrescence and some time afterward eats its way out as it appears from a hole which is formed in all gallnuts that no longer contain an insect it is in hot climates only that strongly astringent gallnuts are found those which are used for the purpose of making ink are brought from aleppo emily but are not the oakapples which grow on the leaves of the oak in this country of a similar nature mrs b yes only they are an inferior species of galls containing less of the astringent principle and therefore less applicable to useful purposes caroline are the vegetable acids never found but in their pure uncombined state mrs b by no means on the contrary they are frequently met with in the state of compound salts these however are in general not fully saturated with the salifiable bases so that the acid predominates and in this state they are called acidulous salts of this kind is the salt called cream of tartar caroline is not the salt of lemon commonly used to take out inkspots and stains of this nature mrs b no that salt consists of the oxalic acid combined with a little potash it is found in that state in sorrel caroline and pray how does it take out inkspots mrs b by uniting with the iron and rendering it soluble in water besides the vegetable materials which we have enumerated a variety of other substances common to the three kingdoms are found in vegetables such as potash which was formerly supposed to belong exclusively to plants and was in consequence called the vegetable alkali sulphur phosphorus earths and a variety of metallic oxyds are also found in vegetables but only in small quantities and we meet sometimes with neutral salts formed by the combination of these ingredients conversation xxi on the decomposition of vegetables caroline the account which you have given us mrs b of the materials of vegetables is doubtless very instructive but it does not completely satisfy my curiosity i wish to know how plants obtain the principles from which their various materials are formed by what means these are converted into vegetable matter and how they are connected with the life of the plant mrs b this implies nothing less than a complete history of the chemistry and physiology of vegetation subjects on which we have yet but very imperfect notions still i hope that i shall be able in some measure to satisfy your curiosity but in order to render the subject more intelligible i must first make you acquainted with the various changes which vegetables undergo when the vital power no longer enables them to resist the common laws of chemical attraction the composition of vegetables being more complicated than that of minerals the former more readily undergo chemical changes than the latter for the greater the variety of attractions the more easily is the equilibrium destroyed and a new order of combinations introduced emily i am surprised that vegetables should be so easily susceptible of decomposition for the preservation of the vegetable kingdom is certainly far more important than that of minerals mrs b you must consider on the other hand how much more easily the former is renewed than the latter the decomposition of the vegetable takes place only after the death of the plant which in the common course of nature happens when it has yielded fruit and seeds to propagate its species if instead of thus finishing its career each plant was to retain its form and vegetable state it would become an useless burden to the earth and its inhabitants when vegetables therefore cease to be productive they cease to live and nature then begins her process of decomposition in order to resolve them into their chemical constituents hydrogen carbon and oxygen those simple and primitive ingredients which she keeps in store for all her combinations emily but since no system of combination can be destroyed except by the establishment of another order of attractions how can the decomposition of vegetables reduce them to their simple elements mrs b it is a very long process during which a variety of new combinations are successively established and successively destroyed but in each of these changes the ingredients of vegetable matter tend to unite in a more simple order of compounds till they are at length brought to their elementary state or at least to their most simple order of combinations thus you will find that vegetables are in the end almost entirely reduced to water and carbonic acid the hydrogen and carbon dividing the oxygen between them so as to form with it these two substances but the variety of intermediate combinations that take place during the several stages of the decomposition of vegetables present us with a new set of compounds well worthy of our examination caroline how is it possible that vegetables while putrefying should produce any thing worthy of observation mrs b they are susceptible of undergoing certain changes before they arrive at the state of putrefaction which is the final term of decomposition and of these changes we avail ourselves for particular and important purposes but in order to make you understand this subject which is of considerable importance i must explain it more in detail the decomposition of vegetables is always attended by a violent internal motion produced by the disunion of one order of particles and the combination of another this is called fermentation there are several periods at which this process stops so that a state of rest appears to be restored and the new order of compounds fairly established but unless means be used to secure these new combinations in their actual state their duration will be but transient and a new fermentation will take place by which the compound last formed will be destroyed and another and less complex order will succeed emily the fermentations then appear to be only the successive steps by which a vegetable descends to its final dissolution mrs b precisely so your definition is perfectly correct caroline and how many fermentations or new arrangements does a vegetable undergo before it is reduced to its simple ingredients mrs b chemists do not exactly agree in this point but there are i think four distinct fermentations or periods at which the decomposition of vegetable matter stops and changes its course but every kind of vegetable matter is not equally susceptible of undergoing all these fermentations there are likewise several circumstances required to produce fermentation water and a certain degree of heat are both essential to this process in order to separate the particles and thus weaken their force of cohesion that the new chemical affinities may be brought into action caroline in frozen climates then how can the spontaneous decomposition of vegetables take place mrs b it certainly cannot and accordingly we find scarcely any vestiges of vegetation where a constant frost prevails caroline one would imagine that on the contrary such spots would be covered with vegetables for since they cannot be decomposed their number must always increase mrs b but my dear heat and water are quite as essential to the formation of vegetables as they are to their decomposition besides it is from the dead vegetables reduced to their elementary principles that the rising generation is supplied with sustenance no young plant therefore can grow unless its predecessors contribute both to its formation and support and these not only furnish the seed from which the new plant springs but likewise the food by which it is nourished caroline under the torrid zone therefore where water is never frozen and the heat is very great both the processes of vegetation and of fermentation must i suppose be extremely rapid mrs b not so much as you imagine for in such climates great part of the water which it requires for these processes is in an ariform state which is scarcely more conducive either to the growth or formation of vegetables than that of ice in those latitudes therefore it is only in low damp situations sheltered by woods from the suns rays that the smaller tribes of vegetables can grow and thrive during the dry season as dead vegetables seldom retain water enough to produce fermentation but are on the contrary soon dried up by the heat of the sun which enables them to resist that process so that it is not till the fall of the autumnal rains which are very violent in such climates that spontaneous fermentation can take place the several fermentations derive their names from their principal products the first is called the saccharine fermentation because its product is sugar caroline but sugar you have told us is found in all vegetables it cannot therefore be the product of their decomposition mrs b it is true that this fermentation is not confined to the decomposition of vegetables as it continually takes place during their life and indeed this circumstance has till lately prevented it from being considered as one of the fermentations but the process appears so analogous to the other fermentations and the formation of sugar whether in living or dead vegetable matter is so evidently a new compound proceeding from the destruction of the previous order of combinations and essential to the subsequent fermentations that it is now i believe generally esteemed the first step or necessary preliminary to decomposition if not an actual commencement of that process caroline i recollect your hinting to us that sugar was supposed not to be secreted from the sap in the same manner as mucilage fecula oil and the other ingredients of vegetables mrs b it is rather from these materials than from the sap itself that sugar is formed and it is developed at particular periods as you may observe in fruits which become sweet in ripening sometimes even after they have been gathered life therefore is not essential to the formation of sugar whilst on the contrary mucilage fecula and the other vegetable materials that are secreted from the sap by appropriate organs whose powers immediately depend on the vital principle cannot be produced but during the existence of that principle emily the ripening of fruits is then their first step to destruction as well as their last towards perfection mrs b exactly a process analogous to the saccharine fermentation takes place also during the cooking of certain vegetables this is the case with parsnips carrots potatoes c in which sweetness is developed by heat and moisture and we know that if we carried the process a little farther a more complete decomposition would ensue the same process takes place also in seeds previous to their sprouting caroline how do you reconcile this to your theory mrs b can you suppose that a decomposition is the necessary precursor of life mrs b that is indeed the case the materials of the seed must be decomposed and the seed disorganized before a plant can sprout from it seeds besides the embrio plant contain as we have already observed fecula oil and a little mucilage these substances are destined for the nourishment of the future plant but they undergo some change before they can be fit for this function the seeds when buried in the earth with a certain degree of moisture and of temperature absorb water which dilates them separates their particles and introduces a new order of attractions of which sugar is the product the substance of the seed is thus softened sweetened and converted into a sort of white milky pulp fit for the nourishment of the embrio plant the saccharine fermentation of seeds is artificially produced for the purpose of making malt by the following process a quantity of barley is first soaked in water for two or three days the water being afterwards drained off the grain heats spontaneously swells bursts sweetens shows a disposition to germinate and actually sprouts to the length of an inch when the process is stopped by putting it into a kiln where it is well dried at a gentle heat in this state it is crisp and friable and constitutes the substance called malt which is the principal ingredient of beer emily but i hope you will tell us how malt is made into beer mrs b certainly but i must first explain to you the nature of the second fermentation which is essential to that operation this is called the vinous fermentation because its product is wine emily how very different the decomposition of vegetables is from what i had imagined the products of their disorganisation appear almost superior to those which they yield during their state of life and perfection mrs b and do you not at the same time admire the beautiful economy of nature which whether she creates or whether she destroys directs all her operations to some useful and benevolent purpose it appears that the saccharine fermentation is extremely favourable if not absolutely essential as a previous step to the vinous fermentation so that if sugar be not developed during the life of the plant the saccharine fermentation must be artificially produced before the vinous fermentation can take place this is the case with barley which does not yield any sugar until it is made into malt and it is in that state only that it is susceptible of undergoing the vinous fermentation by which it is converted into beer caroline but if the product of the vinous fermentation is always wine beer cannot have undergone that process for beer is certainly not wine mrs b chemically speaking beer may be considered as the wine of grain for it is the product of the fermentation of malt just as wine is that of the fermentation of grapes or other fruits the consequence of the vinous fermentation is the decomposition of the saccharine matter and the formation of a spirituous liquor from the constituents of the sugar but in order to promote this fermentation not only water and a certain degree of heat are necessary but also some other vegetable ingredients besides the sugar as fecula mucilage acids salts extractive matter c all of which seem to contribute to this process and give to the liquor its peculiar taste emily it is perhaps for this reason that wine is not obtained from the fermentation of pure sugar but that fruits are chosen for that purpose as they contain not only sugar but likewise the other vegetable ingredients which promote the vinous fermentation and give the peculiar flavour mrs b certainly and you must observe also that the relative quantity of sugar is not the only circumstance to be considered in the choice of vegetable juices for the formation of wine otherwise the sugarcane would be best adapted for that purpose it is rather the manner and proportion in which the sugar is mixed with other vegetable ingredients that influences the production and qualities of wine and it is found that the juice of the grape not only yields the most considerable proportion of wine but that it likewise affords it of the most grateful flavour emily i have seen a vintage in switzerland and i do not recollect that heat was applied or water added to produce the fermentation of the grapes mrs b the common temperature of the atmosphere in the cellars in which the juice of the grape is fermented is sufficiently warm for this purpose and as the juice contains an ample supply of water there is no occasion for any addition of it but when fermentation is produced in dry malt a quantity of water must necessarily be added emily but what are precisely the changes that happen during the vinous fermentation mrs b the sugar is decomposed and its constituents are recombined into two new substances the one a peculiar liquid substance called alcohol or spirit of wine which remains in the fluid the other carbonic acid gas which escapes during the fermentation wine therefore as i before observed in a general point of view may be considered as a liquid of which alcohol constitutes the essential part and the varieties of strength and flavour of the different kinds of wine are to be attributed to the different qualities of the fruits from which they are obtained independently of the sugar caroline i am astonished to hear that so powerful a liquid as spirit of wine should be obtained from so mild a substance as sugar mrs b can you tell me in what the principal difference consists between alcohol and sugar caroline let me reflect sugar consists of carbon hydrogen and oxygen if carbonic acid be subtracted from it during the formation of alcohol the latter will contain less carbon and oxygen than sugar does therefore hydrogen must be the prevailing principle of alcohol mrs b it is exactly so and this very large proportion of hydrogen accounts for the lightness and combustible property of alcohol and of spirits in general all of which consist of alcohol variously modified emily and can sugar be recomposed from the combination of alcohol and carbonic acid mrs b chemists have never been able to succeed in effecting this but from analogy i should suppose such a recomposition possible let us now observe more particularly the phenomena that take place during the vinous fermentation at the commencement of this process heat is evolved and the liquor swells considerably from the formation of the carbonic acid which is disengaged in such prodigious quantities as would be fatal to any person who should unawares inspire it an accident which has sometimes happened if the fermentation be stopped by putting the liquor into barrels before the whole of the carbonic acid is evolved the wine is brisk like champagne from the carbonic acid imprisoned in it and it tastes sweet like cyder from the sugar not being completely decomposed emily but i do not understand why heat should be evolved during this operation for as there is a considerable formation of gas in which a proportionable quantity of heat must become insensible i should have imagined that cold rather than heat would have been produced mrs b it appears so on first consideration but you must recollect that fermentation is a complicated chemical process and that during the decompositions and recompositions attending it a quantity of chemical heat may be disengaged sufficient both to develope the gas and to effect an increase of temperature when the fermentation is completed the liquid cools and subsides the effervescence ceases and the thick sweet sticky juice of the fruit is converted into a clear transparent spirituous liquor called wine emily how much i regret not having been acquainted with the nature of the vinous fermentation when i had an opportunity of seeing the process mrs b you have an easy method of satisfying yourself in that respect by observing the process of brewing which in every essential circumstance is similar to that of making wine and is really a very curious chemical operation although we cannot actually make wine at this moment it will be easy to show you the mode of analyzing it this is done by distillation when wine of any kind is submitted to this operation it is found to contain brandy water tartar extractive colouring matter and some vegetable acids i have put a little port wine into this alembic of glass plate xiv fig 1 and on placing the lamp under it you will soon see the spirit and water successively come over illustration plate xiv vol ii p 213 fig 1 a alembic b lamp c wine glass fig 2 alcohol blowpipe d the lamp e the vessel in which the alcohol is boiling f a safety valve g the inflamed jet or steam of alcohol directed towards a glass tube h emily but you do not mention alcohol amongst the products of the distillation of wine and yet that is its most essential ingredient mrs b the alcohol is contained in the brandy which is now coming over and dropping from the still brandy is nothing more than a mixture of alcohol and water and in order to obtain the alcohol pure we must again distil it from brandy caroline i have just taken a drop on my finger it tastes like strong brandy but it is without colour whilst brandy is of a deep yellow mrs b it is not so naturally in its pure state brandy is colourless and it obtains the yellow tint you observe by extracting the colouring matter from the new oaken casks in which it is kept but if it does not acquire the usual tinge in this way it is the custom to colour the brandy used in this country artificially with a little burnt sugar in order to give it the appearance of having been long kept caroline and is rum also distilled from wine mrs b by no means it is distilled from the sugarcane a plant which contains so great a quantity of sugar that it yields more alcohol than almost any other vegetable after the juice of the cane has been pressed out for making sugar what still remains in the bruised cane is extracted by water and this watery solution of sugar is fermented and produces rum the spirituous liquor called arack is in a similar manner distilled from the product of the vinous fermentation of rice emily but rice has no sweetness does it contain any sugar mrs b like barley and most other seeds it is insipid until it has undergone the saccharine fermentation and this you must recollect is always a previous step to the vinous fermentation in those vegetables in which sugar is not already formed brandy may in the same manner be obtained from malt caroline you mean from beer i suppose for the malt must have previously undergone the vinous fermentation mrs b beer is not precisely the product of the vinous fermentation of malt for hops are a necessary ingredient for the formation of that liquor whilst brandy is distilled from pure fermented malt but brandy might no doubt be distilled from beer as well as from any other liquor that has undergone the vinous fermentation for since the basis of brandy is alcohol it may be obtained from any liquid that contains that spirituous substance emily and pray from what vegetable is the favourite spirit of the lower orders of people gin extracted mrs b the spirit which is the same in all fermented liquors may be obtained from any kind of grain but the peculiar flavour which distinguishes gin is that of juniper berries which are distilled together with the grain i think the brandy contained in the wine which we are distilling must by this time be all come over yestaste the liquid that is now dropping from the alembic caroline it is perfectly insipid like water mrs b it is water which as i was telling you is the second product of wine and comes over after all the spirit which is the lightest part is distilled the tartar and extractive colouring matter we shall find in a solid form at the bottom of the alembic emily they look very like the lees of wine mrs b and in many respects they are of a similar nature for lees of wine consist chiefly of tartrit of potash a salt which exists in the juice of the grape and in many other vegetables and is developed only by the vinous fermentation during this operation it is precipitated and deposits itself on the internal surface of the cask in which the wine is contained it is much used in medicine and in various arts particularly dying under the name of cream of tartar and it is from this salt that the tartarous acid is obtained caroline but the medicinal cream of tartar is in appearance quite different from these darkcoloured dregs it is perfectly colourless mrs b because it consists of the pure salts only in its crystallised form whilst in the instance before us it is mixed with the deepcoloured extractive matter and other foreign ingredients emily pray cannot we now obtain pure alcohol from the brandy which we have distilled mrs b we might but the process would be tedious for in order to obtain alcohol perfectly free from water it is necessary to distil or as the distillers call it rectify it several times you must therefore allow me to produce a bottle of alcohol that has been thus purified this is a very important ingredient which has many striking properties besides its forming the basis of all spirituous liquors emily it is alcohol i suppose that produces intoxication mrs b certainly but the stimulus and momentary energy it gives to the system and the intoxication it occasions when taken in excess are circumstances not yet accounted for caroline i thought that it produced these effects by increasing the rapidity of the circulation of the blood for drinking wine or spirits i have heard always quickens the pulse mrs b no doubt the spirit by stimulating the nerves increases the action of the muscles and the heart which is one of the strongest muscular organs beats with augmented vigour and propels the blood with accelerated quickness after such a strong excitation the frame naturally suffers a proportional degree of depression so that a state of debility and languor is the invariable consequence of intoxication but though these circumstances are well ascertained they are far from explaining why alcohol should produce such effects emily liqueurs are the only kind of spirits which i think pleasant pray of what do they consist mrs b they are composed of alcohol sweetened with syrup and flavoured with volatile oil the different kinds of odoriferous spirituous waters are likewise solutions of volatile oil in alcohol as lavender water eau de cologne c the chemical properties of alcohol are important and numerous it is one of the most powerful chemical agents and is particularly useful in dissolving a variety of substances which are soluble neither by water nor heat emily we have seen it dissolve copal and mastic to form varnishes and these resins are certainly not soluble in water since water precipitates them from their solution in alcohol mrs b i am happy to find that you recollect these circumstances so well the same experiment affords also an instance of another property of alcoholits tendency to unite with water for the resin is precipitated in consequence of losing the alcohol which abandons it from its preference for water it is attended also as you may recollect with the same peculiar circumstance of a disengagement of heat and consequent diminution of bulk which we have supposed to be produced by a mechanical penetration of particles by which latent heat is forced out alcohol unites thus readily not only with resins and with water but with oils and balsams these compounds form the extensive class of elixirs tinctures quintessences c emily i suppose that alcohol must be highly combustible since it contains so large a proportion of hydrogen mrs b extremely so and it will burn at a very moderate temperature caroline i have often seen both brandy and spirit of wine burnt they produce a great deal of flame but not a proportional quantity of heat and no smoke whatever mrs b the last circumstance arises from their combustion being complete and the disproportion between the flame and heat shows you that these are by no means synonymous the great quantity of flame proceeds from the combustion of the hydrogen to which you know that manner of burning is peculiar have you not remarked also that brandy and alcohol will burn without a wick they take fire at so low a temperature that this assistance is not required to concentrate the heat and volatilise the fluid caroline i have sometimes seen brandy burnt by merely heating it in a spoon mrs b the rapidity of the combustion of alcohol may however be prodigiously increased by first volatilising it an ingenious instrument has been constructed on this principle to answer the purpose of a blowpipe which may be used for melting glass or other chemical purposes it consists of a small metallic vessel plate xiv fig 2 of a spherical shape which contains the alcohol and is heated by the lamp beneath it as soon as the alcohol is volatilised it passes through the spout of the vessel and issues just above the wick of the lamp which immediately sets fire to the stream of vapour as i shall show you emily with what amazing violence it burns the flame of alcohol in the state of vapour is i fancy much hotter than when the spirit is merely burnt in a spoon mrs b yes because in this way the combustion goes on much quicker and of course the heat is proportionally increased observe its effect on this small glass tube the middle of which i present to the extremity of the flame where the heat is greatest caroline the glass in that spot is become red hot and bends from its own weight mrs b i have now drawn it asunder and am going to blow a ball at one of the heated ends but i must previously close it up and flatten it with this little metallic instrument otherwise the breath would pass through the tube without dilating any part of it now caroline will you blow strongly into the tube whilst the closed end is red hot emily you blowed too hard for the ball suddenly dilated to a great size and then burst in pieces mrs b you will be more expert another time but i must caution you should you ever use this blowpipe to be very careful that the combustion of the alcohol does not go on with too great violence for i have seen the flame sometimes dart out with such force as to reach the opposite wall of the room and set the paint on fire there is however no danger of the vessel bursting as it is provided with a safety tube which affords an additional vent for the vapour of alcohol when required the products of the combustion of alcohol consist in a great proportion of water and a small quantity of carbonic acid there is no smoke or fixed remains whatever how do you account for that emily emily i suppose that the oxygen which the alcohol absorbs in burning converts its hydrogen into water and its carbon into carbonic acid gas and thus it is completely consumed mrs b very well ether the lightest of all fluids and with which you are well acquainted is obtained from alcohol of which it forms the lightest and most volatile part emily ether then is to alcohol what alcohol is to brandy mrs b no there is an essential difference in order to obtain alcohol from brandy you need only deprive the latter of its water but for the formation of ether the alcohol must be decomposed and one of its constituents partly subtracted i leave you to guess which of them it is emily it cannot be hydrogen as ether is more volatile than alcohol and hydrogen is the lightest of all its ingredients nor do i suppose that it can be oxygen as alcohol contains so small a proportion of that principle it is therefore most probably carbon a diminution of which would not fail to render the new compound more volatile mrs b you are perfectly right the formation of ether consists simply in subtracting from the alcohol a certain proportion of carbon this is effected by the action of the sulphuric nitric or muriatic acids on alcohol the acid and carbon remain at the bottom of the vessel whilst the decarbonised alcohol flies off in the form of a condensable vapour which is ether ether is the most inflammable of all fluids and burns at so slow a temperature that the heat evolved during its combustion is more than is required for its support so that a quantity of ether is volatilised which takes fire and gradually increases the violence of the combustion sir humphry davy has lately discovered a very singular fact respecting the vapour of ether if a few drops of ether be poured into a wineglass and a fine platina wire heated almost to redness be held suspended in the glass close to the surface of the ether the wire soon becomes intensely redhot and remains so for any length of time we may easily try the experiment caroline how very curious the wire is almost white hot and a pungent smell rises from the glass pray how is this accounted for mrs b this is owing to a very peculiar property of the vapour of ether and indeed of many other combustible gaseous bodies at a certain temperature lower than that of ignition these vapours undergo a slow and imperfect combustion which does not give rise in any sensible degree to the phenomena of light and flame and yet extricates a quantity of caloric sufficient to react upon the wire and make it redhot and the wire in its turn keeps up the effect as long as the emission of vapour continues caroline but why should not an iron or silver wire produce the same effect mrs b because either iron or silver being much better conductors of heat than platina the heat is carried off too fast by those metals to allow the accumulation of caloric necessary to produce the effect in question ether is so light that it evaporates at the common temperature of the atmosphere it is therefore necessary to keep it confined by a well ground glass stopper no degree of cold known has ever frozen it caroline is it not often taken medicinally mrs b yes it is one of the most effectual antispasmodic medicines and the quickness of its effects as such probably depends on its being instantly converted into vapour by the heat of the stomach through the intervention of which it acts on the nervous system but the frequent use of ether like that of spirituous liquors becomes prejudicial and if taken to excess it produces effects similar to those of intoxication we may now take our leave of the vinous fermentation of which i hope you have acquired a clear idea as well as of the several products that are derived from it caroline though this process appears at first sight so much complicated it may i think be summed up in a few words as it consists in the conversion of sugar and fermentable bodies into alcohol and carbonic acid which give rise both to the formation of wine and of all kinds of spirituous liquors mrs b we shall now proceed to the acetous fermentation which is thus called because it converts wine into vinegar by the formation of the acetous acid which is the basis or radical of vinegar caroline but is not the acidifying principle of the acetous acid the same as that of all other acids oxygen mrs b certainly and on that account the contact of air is essential to this fermentation as it affords the necessary supply of oxygen vinegar in order to obtain pure acetous acid from it must be distilled and rectified by certain processes emily but pray mrs b is not the acetous acid frequently formed without this fermentation taking place is it not for instance contained in acid fruits and in every substance that becomes sour mrs b no not in fruits you confound it with the citric the malic the oxalic and other vegetable acids to which living vegetables owe their acidity but whenever a vegetable substance turns sour after it has ceased to live the acetous acid is developed by means of the acetous fermentation in which the substance advances a step towards its final decomposition amongst the various instances of acetous fermentation that of bread is usually classed caroline but the fermentation of bread is produced by yeast how does that effect it mrs b it is found by experience that any substance that has already undergone a fermentation will readily excite it in one that is susceptible of that process if for instance you mix a little vinegar with wine that is intended to be acidified it will absorb oxygen more rapidly and the process be completed much sooner than if left to ferment spontaneously thus yeast which is a product of the fermentation of beer is used to excite and accelerate the fermentation of malt which is to be converted into beer as well as that of paste which is to be made into bread caroline but if bread undergoes the acetous fermentation why is it not sour mrs b it acquires a certain savour which corrects the heavy insipidity of flour and may be reckoned a first degree of acidification or if the process were carried further the bread would become decidedly acid there are however some chemists who do not consider the fermentation of bread as being of the acetous kind but suppose that it is a process of fermentation peculiar to that substance the putrid fermentation is the final operation of nature and her last step towards reducing organised bodies to their simplest combinations all vegetables spontaneously undergo this fermentation after death provided there be a sufficient degree of heat and moisture together with access of air for it is well known that dead plants may be preserved by drying or by the total exclusion of air caroline but do dead plants undergo the other fermentation previous to this last or do they immediately suffer the putrid fermentation mrs b that depends on a variety of circumstances such as the degrees of temperature and of moisture the nature of the plant itself c but if you were carefully to follow and examine the decomposition of plants from their death to their final dissolution you would generally find a sweetness developed in the seeds and a spirituous flavour in the fruits which have undergone the saccharine fermentation previous to the total disorganisation and separation of the parts emily i have sometimes remarked a kind of spirituous taste in fruits that were over ripe especially oranges and this was just before they became rotten mrs b it was then the vinous fermentation which had succeeded the saccharine and had you followed up these changes attentively you would probably have found the spirituous taste followed by acidity previous to the fruit passing to the state of putrefaction when the leaves fall from the trees in autumn they do not if there is no great moisture in the atmosphere immediately undergo a decomposition but are first dried and withered as soon however as the rain sets in fermentation commences their gaseous products are imperceptibly evolved into the atmosphere and their fixed remains mixed with their kindred earth wood when exposed to moisture also undergoes the putrid fermentation and becomes rotten emily but i have heard that the dry rot which is so liable to destroy the beams of houses is prevented by a current of air and yet you said that air was essential to the putrid fermentation mrs b true but it must not be in such a proportion to the moisture as to dissolve the latter and this is generally the case when the rotting of wood is prevented or stopped by the free access of air what is commonly called dry rot however is not i believe a true process of putrefaction it is supposed to depend on a peculiar kind of vegetation which by feeding on the wood gradually destroys it straw and all other kinds of vegetable matter undergo the putrid fermentation more rapidly when mixed with animal matter much heat is evolved during this process and a variety of volatile products are disengaged as carbonic acid and hydrogen gas the latter of which is frequently either sulphurated or phosphorated when all these gases have been evolved the fixed products consisting of carbon salts potash c form a kind of vegetable earth which makes very fine manure as it is composed of those elements which form the immediate materials of plants caroline pray are not vegetables sometimes preserved from decomposition by petrification i have seen very curious specimens of petrified vegetables in which state they perfectly preserve their form and organisation though in appearance they are changed to stone mrs b that is a kind of metamorphosis which now that you are tolerably well versed in the history of mineral and vegetable substances i leave to your judgment to explain do you imagine that vegetables can be converted into stone emily no certainly but they might perhaps be changed to a substance in appearance resembling stone mrs b it is not so however with the substances that are called petrified vegetables for these are really stone and generally of the hardest kind consisting chiefly of silex the case is this when a vegetable is buried under water or in wet earth it is slowly and gradually decomposed as each successive particle of the vegetable is destroyed its place is supplied by a particle of siliceous earth conveyed thither by the water in the course of time the vegetable is entirely destroyed but the silex has completely replaced it having assumed its form and apparent texture as if the vegetable itself were changed to stone caroline that is very curious and i suppose that petrified animal substances are of the same nature mrs b precisely it is equally impossible for either animal or vegetable substances to be converted into stone they may be reduced as we find they are by decomposition to their constituent elements but cannot be changed to elements which do not enter into their composition there are however circumstances which frequently prevent the regular and final decomposition of vegetables as for instance when they are buried either in the sea or in the earth where they cannot undergo the putrid fermentation for want of air in these cases they are subject to a peculiar change by which they are converted into a new class of compounds called bitumens caroline these are substances i never heard of before mrs b you will find however that some of them are very familiar to you bitumens are vegetables so far decomposed as to retain no organic appearance but their origin is easily detected by their oily nature their combustibility the products of their analysis and the impressions of the forms of leaves grains fibres of wood and even of animals which they frequently bear they are sometimes of an oily liquid consistence as the substance called naptha in which we preserved potassium it is a fine transparent colourless fluid that issues out of clays in some parts of persia but more frequently bitumens are solid as asphaltum a smooth hard brittle substance which easily melts and forms in its liquid state a beautiful dark brown colour for oil painting jet which is of a still harder texture is a peculiar bitumen susceptible of so fine a polish that it is used for many ornamental purposes coal is also a bituminous substance to the composition of which both the mineral and animal kingdoms seem to concur this most useful mineral appears to consist chiefly of vegetable matter mixed with the remains of marine animals and marine salts and occasionally containing a quantity of sulphuret of iron commonly called pyrites emily it is i suppose the earthly the metallic and the saline parts of coals that compose the cinders or fixed products of their combustion whilst the hydrogen and carbon which they derive from vegetables constitute their volatile products caroline pray is not coke which i have heard is much used in some manufactures also a bituminous substance mrs b no it is a kind of fuel artificially prepared from coals it consists of coals reduced to a substance analogous to charcoal by the evaporation of their bituminous parts coke therefore is composed of carbon with some earthy and saline ingredients succin or yellow amber is a bitumen which the ancients called electrum from whence the word electricity is derived as that substance is peculiarly and was once supposed to be exclusively electric it is found either deeply buried in the bowels of the earth or floating on the sea and is supposed to be a resinous body which has been acted on by sulphuric acid as its analysis shows it to consist of ah oil and an acid the oil is called oil of amber the acid the succinic emily that oil i have sometimes used in painting as it is reckoned to change less than the other kinds of oils mrs b the last class of vegetable substances that have changed their nature are fossilwood peat and turf these are composed of wood and roots of shrubs that are partly decomposed by being exposed to moisture under ground and yet in some measure preserve their form and organic appearance the peat or black earth of the moors retains but few vestiges of the roots to which it owes its richness and combustibility these substances being in the course of time reduced to the state of vegetable earth but in turf the roots of plants are still discernible and it equally answers the purpose of fuel it is the combustible used by the poor in heathy countries which supply it abundantly it is too late this morning to enter upon the history of vegetation we shall reserve this subject therefore for our next interview when i expect that it will furnish us with ample matter for another conversation conversation xxii history of vegetation mrs b the vegetable kingdom may be considered as the link which unites the mineral and animal creation into one common chain of beings for it is through the means of vegetation alone that mineral substances are introduced into the animal system since generally speaking it is from vegetables that all animals ultimately derive their sustenance caroline i do not understand that the human species subsists as much on animal as on vegetable food and there are some carnivorous animals that will eat only animal food mrs b that is true but you do not consider that those that live on animal food derive their sustenance equally though not so immediately from vegetables the meat that we eat is formed from the herbs of the field and the prey of carnivorous animals proceeds either directly or indirectly from the same source it is therefore through this channel that the simple elements become a part of the animal frame we should in vain attempt to derive nourishment from carbon hydrogen and oxygen either in their separate state or combined in the mineral kingdom for it is only by being united in the form of vegetable combination that they become capable of conveying nourishment emily vegetation then seems to be the method which nature employs to prepare the food of animals mrs b that is certainly its principal object the vegetable creation does not exhibit more wisdom in that admirable system of organisation by which it is enabled to answer its own immediate ends of preservation nutrition and propagation than in its grand and ultimate object of forming those arrangements and combinations of principles which are so well adapted for the nourishment of animals emily but i am very curious to know whence vegetables obtain those principles which form their immediate materials mrs b this is a point on which we are yet so much in the dark that i cannot hope fully to satisfy your curiosity but what little i know on this subject i will endeavour to explain to you the soil which at first view appears to be the aliment of vegetables is found on a closer investigation to be little more than the channel through which they receive their nourishment so that it is very possible to rear plants without any earth or soil caroline of that we have an instance in the hyacinth and other bulbous roots which will grow and blossom beautifully in glasses of water but i confess i should think it would be difficult to rear trees in a similar manner mrs b no doubt it would as it is the burying of the roots in the earth that supports the stem of the tree but this office besides that of affording a vehicle for food is far the most important part which the earthy portion of the soil performs in the process of vegetation for we can discover by analysis but an extremely small proportion of earth in vegetable compounds caroline but if earths do not afford nourishment why is it necessary to be so attentive to the preparation of the soil mrs b in order to impart to it those qualities which render it a proper vehicle for the food of the plant water is the chief nourishment of vegetables if therefore the soil be too sandy it will not retain a quantity of water sufficient to supply the roots of the plants if on the contrary it abound too much with clay the water will lodge in such quantities as to threaten a decomposition of the roots calcareous soils are upon the whole the most favourable to the growth of plants soils are therefore usually improved by chalk which you may recollect is a carbonat of lime different vegetables however require different kinds of soils thus rice demands a moist retentive soil potatoes a soft sandy soil wheat a firm and rich soil forest trees grow better in fine sand than in a stiff clay and a light ferruginous soil is best suited to fruittrees caroline but pray what is the use of manuring the soil mrs b manure consists of all kinds of substances whether of vegetable or animal origin which have undergone the putrid fermentation and are consequently decomposed or nearly so into their elementary principles and it is requisite that these vegetable matters should be in a state of decay or approaching decomposition the addition of calcareous earth in the state of chalk or lime is beneficial to such soils as it accelerates the dissolution of vegetable bodies now i ask you what is the utility of supplying the soil with these decomposed substances caroline it is i suppose in order to furnish vegetables with the principles which enter into their composition for manures not only contain carbon hydrogen and oxygen but by their decomposition supply the soil with these principles in their elementary form mrs b undoubtedly and it is for this reason that the finest crops are produced in fields that were formerly covered with woods because their soil is composed of a rich mould a kind of vegetable earth which abounds in those principles emily this accounts for the plentifulness of the crops produced in america where the country was but a few years since covered with wood caroline but how is it that animal substances are reckoned to produce the best manure does it not appear much more natural that the decomposed elements of vegetables should be the most appropriate to the formation of new vegetables mrs b the addition of a much greater proportion of nitrogen which constitutes the chief difference between animal and vegetable matter renders the composition of the former more complicated and consequently more favourable to decomposition the use of animal substances is chiefly to give the first impulse to the fermentation of the vegetable ingredients that enter into the composition of manures the manure of a farmyard is of that description but there is scarcely any substance susceptible of undergoing the putrid fermentation that will not make good manure the heat produced by the fermentation of manure is another circumstance which is extremely favourable to vegetation yet this heat would be too great if the manure was laid on the ground during the height of fermentation it is used in this state only for hotbeds to produce melons cucumbers and such vegetables as require a very high temperature caroline a difficulty has just occurred to me which i do not know how to remove since all organised bodies are in the common course of nature ultimately reduced to their elementary state they must necessarily in that state enrich the soil and afford food for vegetation how is it then that agriculture which cannot increase the quantity of those elements that are required to manure the earth can increase its produce so wonderfully as is found to be the case in all cultivated countries mrs b it is by suffering none of these decaying bodies to be dissipated but in applying them duly to the soil it is by a judicious preparation of the soil which consists in fitting it either for the general purposes of vegetation or for that of the particular seed which is to be sown thus if the soil be too wet it may be drained if too loose and sandy it may be rendered more consistent and retentive of water by the addition of clay or loam it may be enriched by chalk or any kind of calcareous earth on soils thus improved manures will act with double efficacy and if attention be paid to spread them on the ground at a proper season of the year to mix them with the soil so that they may be generally diffused through it to destroy the weeds which might appropriate these nutritive principles to their own use to remove the stones which would impede the growth of the plant c we may obtain a produce an hundred fold more abundant than the earth would spontaneously supply emily we have a very striking instance of this in the scanty produce of uncultivated commons compared to the rich crops of meadows which are occasionally manured caroline but mrs b though experience daily proves the advantage of cultivation there is still a difficulty which i cannot get over a certain quantity of elementary principles exist in nature which it is not in the power of man either to augment or diminish of these principles you have taught us that both the animal and vegetable creation are composed now the more of them is taken up by the vegetable kingdom the less it would seem will remain for animals and therefore the more populous the earth becomes the less it will produce mrs b your reasoning is very plausible but experience every where contradicts the inference you would draw from it for we find that the animal and vegetable kingdoms instead of thriving as you would suppose at each others expense always increase and multiply together for you should recollect that animals can derive the elements of which they are formed only through the medium of vegetables and you must allow that your conclusion would be valid only if every particle of the several principles that could possibly be spared from other purposes were employed in the animal and vegetable creations now we have reason to believe that a much greater proportion of these principles than is required for such purposes remains either in an elementary state or engaged in a less useful mode of combination in the mineral kingdom possessed of such immense resources as the atmosphere and the waters afford us for oxygen hydrogen and carbon so far from being in danger of working up all our simple materials we cannot suppose that we shall ever bring agriculture to such a degree of perfection as to require the whole of what these resources could supply nature however in thus furnishing us with an inexhaustible stock of raw materials leaves it in some measure to the ingenuity of man to appropriate them to its own purposes but like a kind parent she stimulates him to exertion by setting the example and pointing out the way for it is on the operations of nature that all the improvements of art are founded the art of agriculture consists therefore in discovering the readiest method of obtaining the several principles either from their grand sources air and water or from the decomposition of organised bodies and in appropriating them in the best manner to the purposes of vegetation emily but among the sources of nutritive principles i am surprised that you do not mention the earth itself as it contains abundance of coals which are chiefly composed of carbon mrs b though coals abound in carbon they cannot on account of their hardness and impermeable texture be immediately subservient to the purposes of vegetation emily no but by their combustion carbonic acid is produced and this entering into various combinations on the surface of the earth may perhaps assist in promoting vegetation mrs b probably it may in some degree but at any rate the quantity of nourishment which vegetables may derive from that source can be but very trifling and must entirely depend on local circumstances caroline perhaps the smoky atmosphere of london is the cause of vegetation being so forward and so rich in its vicinity mrs b i rather believe that this circumstance proceeds from the very ample supply of manure assisted perhaps by the warmth and shelter which the town affords far from attributing any good to the smoky atmosphere of london i confess i like to anticipate the time when we shall have made such progress in the art of managing combustion that every particle of carbon will be consumed and the smoke destroyed at the moment of its production we may then expect to have the satisfaction of seeing the atmosphere of london as clear as that of the country but to return to our subject i hope that you are now convinced that we shall not easily experience a deficiency of nutritive elements to fertilise the earth and that provided we are but industrious in applying them to the best advantage by improving the art of agriculture no limits can be assigned to the fruits that we may expect to reap from our labours caroline yes i am perfectly satisfied in that respect and i can assure you that i feel already much more interested in the progress and improvement of agriculture emily i have frequently thought that the culture of the land was not considered as a concern of sufficient importance manufactures always take the lead and health and innocence are frequently sacrificed to the prospect of a more profitable employment it has often grieved me to see the poor manufacturers crowded together in close rooms and confined for the whole day to the most uniform and sedentary employment instead of being engaged in that innocent and salutary kind of labour which nature seems to have assigned to man for the immediate acquirement of comfort and for the preservation of his existence i am sure that you agree with me in thinking so mrs b mrs b i am entirely of your opinion my dear in regard to the importance of agriculture but as the conveniences of life which we are all enjoying are not derived merely from the soil i am far from wishing to depreciate manufactures besides as the labour of one man is sufficient to produce food for several those whose industry is not required in tillage must do something in return for the food that is provided for them they exchange consequently the accommodations for the necessaries of life thus the carpenter and the weaver lodge and clothe the peasant who supplies them with their daily bread the greater stock of provisions therefore which the husbandman produces the greater is the quantity of accommodation which the artificer prepares such are the happy effects which naturally result from civilised society it would be wiser therefore to endeavour to improve the situation of those who are engaged in manufactures than to indulge in vain declamations on the hardships to which they are too frequently exposed but we must not yet take our leave of the subject of agriculture we have prepared the soil it remains for us now to sow the seed in this operation we must be careful not to bury it too deep in the ground as the access of air is absolutely necessary to its germination the earth must therefore lie loose and light over it in order that the air may penetrate hence the use of ploughing and digging harrowing and raking c a certain degree of heat and moisture such as usually takes place in the spring is likewise necessary caroline one would imagine you were going to describe the decomposition of an old plant rather than the formation of a new one for you have enumerated all the requisites of fermentation mrs b do you forget my dear that the young plant derives its existence from the destruction of the seed and that it is actually by the saccharine fermentation that the latter is decomposed caroline true i wonder that i did not recollect that the temperature and moisture required for the germination of the seed is then employed in producing the saccharine fermentation within it mrs b certainly but in order to understand the nature of germination you should be acquainted with the different parts of which the seed is composed the external covering or envelope contains besides the germ of the future plant the substance which is to constitute its first nourishment this substance which is called the parenchyma consists of fecula mucilage and oil as we formerly observed the seed is generally divided into two compartments called lobes or cotyledons as is exemplified by this bean plate xv fig 1the darkcoloured kind of string which divides the lobes is called the radicle as it forms the root of the plant and it is from a contiguous substance called plumula which is enclosed within the lobes that the stem arises the figure and size of the seed depend very much upon the cotyledons these vary in number in different seeds some have only one as wheat oats barley and all the grasses some have three others six but most seeds as for instance all the varieties of beans have two cotyledons when the seed is buried in the earth at any temperature above 40 degrees it imbibes water which softens and swells the lobes it then absorbs oxygen which combines with some of its carbon and is returned in the form of carbonic acid this loss of carbon increases the comparative proportion of hydrogen and oxygen in the seed and excites the saccharine fermentation by which the parenchymatous matter is converted into a kind of sweet emulsion in this form it is carried into the radicle by vessels appropriated to that purpose and in the mean time the fermentation having caused the seed to burst the cotyledons are rent asunder the radicle strikes into the ground and becomes the root of the plant and hence the fermented liquid is conveyed to the plumula whose vessels have been previously distended by the heat of the fermentation the plumula being thus swelled as it were by the emulsive fluid raises itself and springs up to the surface of the earth bearing with it the cotyledons which as soon as they come in contact with the air spread themselves and are transformed into leaves if we go into the garden we shall probably find some seeds in the state which i have described illustration plate xv vol ii p 250 germination fig 1 2 ab cotyledons c envelope d radicle fig 3 ab cotyledons c plumula d radicle fig 4 ab cotyledons c plumula d radicle fig 5 apparatus to illustrate the mechanism of breathing aa glass bell b bladder representing the lungs c bladder representing the diaphragm emily here are some lupines that are just making their appearance above ground mrs b we shall take up several of them to observe their different degrees of progress in vegetation here is one that has but recently burst its envelopedo you see the little radicle striking downwards plate xv fig 2 in this the plumula is not yet visible but here is another in a greater state of forwardnessthe plumula or stem has risen out of the ground and the cotyledons are converted into seed leaves plate xv fig 3 caroline these leaves are very thick and clumsy and unlike the other leaves which i perceive are just beginning to appear mrs b it is because they retain the remains of the parenchyma with which they still continue to nourish the young plant as it has not yet sufficient roots and strength to provide for its sustenance from the soil but in this third lupine plate xv fig 4 the radicle had sunk deep into the earth and sent out several shoots each of which is furnished with a mouth to suck up nourishment from the soil the function of the original leaves therefore being no longer required they are gradually decaying and the plumula is become a regular stem shooting out small branches and spreading its foliage emily there seems to be a very striking analogy between a seed and an egg both require an elevation of temperature to be brought to life both at first supply with aliment the organised being which they produce and as soon as this has attained sufficient strength to procure its own nourishment the eggshell breaks whilst in the plant the seedleaves fall off mrs b there is certainly some resemblance between these processes and when you become acquainted with animal chemistry you will frequently be struck with its analogy to that of the vegetable kingdom as soon as the young plant feeds from the soil it requires the assistance of leaves which are the organs by which it throws off its superabundant fluid this secretion is much more plentiful in the vegetable than in the animal creation and the great extent of surface of the foliage of plants is admirably calculated for carrying it on in sufficient quantities this transpired fluid consists of little more than water the sap by this process is converted into a liquid of greater consistence which is fit to be assimilated to its several parts emily vegetation then must be essentially injured by destroying the leaves of the plant mrs b undoubtedly it not only diminishes the transpiration but also the absorption by the roots for the quantity of sap absorbed is always in proportion to the quantity of fluid thrown off by transpiration you see therefore the necessity that a young plant should unfold its leaves as soon as it begins to derive its nourishment from the soil and accordingly you will find that those lupines which have dropped their seedleaves and are no longer fed by the parenchyma have spread their foliage in order to perform the office just described but i should inform you that this function of transpiration seems to be confined to the upper surface of the leaves whilst on the contrary the lower surface which is more rough and uneven and furnished with a kind of hair or down is destined to absorb moisture or such other ingredients as the plant derives from the atmosphere as soon as a young plant makes its appearance above ground light as well as air becomes necessary to its preservation light is essential to the development of the colours and to the thriving of the plant you may have often observed what a predilection vegetables have for the light if you make any plants grow in a room they all spread their leaves and extend their branches towards the windows caroline and many plants close up their flowers as soon as it is dark emily but may not this be owing to the cold and dampness of the evening air mrs b that does not appear to be the case for in a course of curious experiments made by mr senebier of geneva on plants which he reared by lamplight he found that the flowers closed their petals whenever the lamps were extinguished emily but pray why is air essential to vegetation plants do not breathe it like animals mrs b at least not in the same manner but they certainly derive some principles from the atmosphere and yield others to it indeed it is chiefly owing to the action of the atmosphere and the vegetable kingdom on each other that the air continues always fit for respiration but you will understand this better when i have explained the effect of water on plants i have said that water forms the chief nourishment of plants it is the basis not only of the sap but of all the vegetable juices water is the vehicle which carries into the plant the various salts and other ingredients required for the formation and support of the vegetable system nor is this all part of the water itself is decomposed by the organs of the plant the hydrogen becomes a constituent part of oil of extract of colouring matter c whilst a portion of the oxygen enters into the formation of mucilage of fecula of sugar and of vegetable acids but the greater part of the oxygen proceeding from the decomposition of the water is converted into a gaseous state by the caloric disengaged from the hydrogen during its condensation in the formation of the vegetable materials in this state the oxygen is transpired by the leaves of plants when exposed to the suns rays thus you find that the decomposition of water by the organs of the plant is not only a means of supplying it with its chief ingredient hydrogen but at the same time of replenishing the atmosphere with oxygen a principle which requires continual renovation to make up for the great consumption of it occasioned by the numerous oxygenations combustions and respirations that are constantly taking place on the surface of the globe emily what a striking instance of the harmony of nature mrs b and how admirable the design of providence who makes every different part of the creation thus contribute to the support and renovation of each other but the intercourse of the vegetable and animal kingdoms through the medium of the atmosphere extends still further animals in breathing not only consume the oxygen of the air but load it with carbonic acid which if accumulated in the atmosphere would in a short time render it totally unfit for respiration here the vegetable kingdom again interferes it attracts and decomposes the carbonic acid retains the carbon for its own purposes and returns the oxygen for ours caroline how interesting this is i do not know a more beautiful illustration of the wisdom which is displayed in the laws of nature mrs b faint and imperfect as are the ideas which our limited perceptions enable us to form of divine wisdom still they cannot fail to inspire us with awe and admiration what then would be our feelings were the complete system of nature at once displayed before us so magnificent a scene would probably be too great for our limited and imperfect comprehension and it is no doubt among the wise dispensations of providence to veil the splendour of a glory with which we should be overpowered but it is well suited to the nature of a rational being to explore step by step the works of the creation to endeavour to connect them into harmonious systems and in a word to trace in the chain of beings the kindred ties and benevolent design which unites its various links and secure its preservation caroline but of what nature are the organs of plants which are endued with such wonderful powers mrs b they are so minute that their structure as well as the mode in which they perform their functions generally elude our examination but we may consider them as so many vessels or apparatus appropriated to perform with the assistance of the principle of life certain chemical processes by means of which these vegetable compounds are generated we may however trace the tannin resins gum mucilage and some other vegetable materials in the organised arrangement of plants in which they form the bark the wood the leaves flowers and seeds the bark is composed of the epidermis the parenchyma and the cortical layers the epidermis is the external covering of the plant it is a thin transparent membrane consisting of a number of slender fibres crossing each other and forming a kind of network when of a white glossy nature as in several species of trees in the stems of corn and of seeds it is composed of a thin coating of siliceous earth which accounts for the strength and hardness of those long and slender stems sir h davy was led to the discovery of the siliceous nature of the epidermis of such plants by observing the singular phenomenon of sparks of fire emitted by the collision of ratan canes with which two boys were fighting in a dark room on analysing the epidermis of the cane he found it to be almost entirely siliceous caroline with iron then a cane i suppose will strike fire very easily mrs b i understand that it will in evergreens the epidermis is mostly resinous and in some few plants is formed of wax the resin from its want of affinity for water tends to preserve the plant from the destructive effects of violent rains severe climates or inclement seasons to which this species of vegetables is peculiarly exposed emily resin must preserve wood just like a varnish as it is the essential ingredient of varnishes mrs b yes and by this means it prevents likewise all unnecessary expenditure of moisture the parenchyma is immediately beneath the epidermis it is that green rind which appears when you strip a branch of any tree or shrub of its external coat of bark the parenchyma is not confined to the stem or branches but extends over every part of the plant it forms the green matter of the leaves and is composed of tubes filled with a peculiar juice the cortical layers are immediately in contact with the wood they abound with tannin and gallic acid and consist of small vessels through which the sap descends after being elaborated in the leaves the cortical layers are annually renewed the old bark being converted into wood emily but through what vessels does the sap ascend mrs b that function is performed by the tubes of the alburnum or wood which is immediately beneath the cortical layers the wood is composed of woody fibre mucilage and resin the fibres are disposed in two ways some of them longitudinally and these form what is called the silver grain of the wood the others which are concentric are called the spurious grain these last are disposed in layers from the number of which the age of the tree may be computed a new one being produced annually by the conversion of the bark into wood the oldest and consequently most internal part of the alburnum is called heartwood it appears to be dead at least no vital functions are discernible in it it is through the tubes of the living alburnum that the sap rises these therefore spread into the leaves and there communicate with the extremities of the vessels of the cortical layers into which they pour their contents caroline of what use then are the tubes of the parenchyma since neither the ascending nor descending sap passes through them mrs b they are supposed to perform the important function of secreting from the sap the peculiar juices from which the plant more immediately derives its nourishment these juices are very conspicuous as the vessels which contain them are much larger than those through which the sap circulates the peculiar juices of plants differ much in their nature not only in different species of vegetables but frequently in different parts of the same individual plant they are sometimes saccharine as in the sugarcane sometimes resinous as in firs and evergreens sometimes of a milky appearance as in the laurel emily i have often observed that in breaking a young shoot or in bruising a leaf of laurel a milky juice will ooze out in great abundance mrs b and it is by making incisions in the bark that pitch tar and turpentine are obtained from firtrees the durability of this species of wood is chiefly owing to the resinous nature of its peculiar juices the volatile oils have in a great measure the same preservative effects as they defend the parts with which they are connected from the attack of insects this tribe seems to have as great an aversion to perfumes as the human species have delight in them they scarcely ever attack any odoriferous parts of plants and it is not uncommon to see every leaf of a tree destroyed by a blight whilst the blossoms remain untouched cedar sandal and all aromatic woods are on this account of great durability emily but the wood of the oak which is so much esteemed for its durability has i believe no smell does it derive this quality from its hardness alone mrs b not entirely for the chesnut though considerably harder and firmer than the oak is not so lasting the durability of the oak is i believe in a great measure owing to its having very little heartwood the alburnum preserving its vital functions longer than in other trees caroline if incisions are made into the alburnum and cortical layers may not the ascending and descending sap be procured in the same manner as the peculiar juice is from the vessels of the parenchyma mrs b yes but in order to obtain specimens of these fluids in any quantity the experiment must be made in the spring when the sap circulates with the greatest energy for this purpose a small bent glass tube should be introduced into the incision through which the sap may flow without mixing with any of the other juices of the tree from the bark the sap will flow much more plentifully than from the wood as the ascending sap is much more liquid more abundant and more rapid in its motion than that which descends for the latter having been deprived by the operation of the leaves of a considerable part of its moisture contains a much greater proportion of solid matter which retards its motion it does not appear that there is any excess of descending sap as none ever exudes from the roots of plants this process therefore seems to be carried on only in proportion to the wants of the plant and the sap descends no further and in no greater quantity than is required to nourish the several organs therefore though the sap rises and descends in the plant it does not appear to undergo a real circulation the last of the organs of plants is the flower or blossom which produces the fruits and seed these may be considered as the ultimate purpose of nature in the vegetable creation from fruits and seeds animals derive both a plentiful source of immediate nourishment and an ample provision for the reproduction of the same means of subsistence the seed which forms the final product of mature plants we have already examined as constituting the first rudiments of future vegetation these are the principal organs of vegetation by means of which the several chemical processes which are carried on during the life of the plant are performed emily but how are the several principles which enter into the composition of vegetables so combined by the organs of the plant as to be converted into vegetable matter mrs b by chemical processes no doubt but the apparatus in which they are performed is so extremely minute as completely to elude our examination we can form an opinion therefore only by the result of these operations the sap is evidently composed of water absorbed by the roots and holding in solution the various principles which it derives from the soil from the roots the sap ascends through the tubes of the alburnum into the stem and thence branches out to every extremity of the plant together with the sap circulates a certain quantity of carbonic acid which is gradually disengaged from the former by the internal heat of the plant caroline what have vegetables a peculiar heat analogous to animal heat mrs b it is a circumstance that has long been suspected but late experiments have decided beyond a doubt that vegetable heat is considerably above that of unorganised matter in winter and below it in summer the wood of a tree is about sixty degrees when the thermometer is seventy or eighty degrees and the bark though so much exposed is seldom below forty in winter it is from the sap after it has been elaborated by the leaves that vegetables derive their nourishment in its progress through the plant from the leaves to the roots it deposits in the several sets of vessels with which it communicates the materials on which the growth and nourishment of each plant depends it is thus that the various peculiar juices saccharine oily mucous acid and colouring are formed as also the more solid parts fecula woody fibre tannin resins concrete salts in a word all the immediate materials of vegetables as well as the organised parts of plants which latter besides the power of secreting these from the sap for the general purpose of the plant have also that of applying them to their own particular nourishment emily but why should the process of vegetation take place only at one season of the year whilst a total inaction prevails during the other mrs b heat is such an important chemical agent that its effect as such might perhaps alone account for the impulse which the spring gives to vegetation but in order to explain the mechanism of that operation it has been supposed that the warmth of the spring dilates the vessels of plants and produces a kind of vacuum into which the sap which had remained in a state of inaction in the trunk during the winter rises this is followed by the ascent of the sap contained in the roots and room is thus made for fresh sap which the roots in their turn pump up from the soil this process goes on till the plant blossoms and bears fruit which terminates its summer career but when the cold weather sets in the fibres and vessels contract the leaves wither and are no longer able to perform their office of transpiration and as this secretion stops the roots cease to absorb sap from the soil if the plant be an annual its life then terminates if not it remains in a state of torpid inaction during the winter or the only internal motion that takes place is that of a small quantity of resinous juice which slowly rises from the stem into the branches and enlarges their buds during the winter caroline yet in evergreens vegetation must continue throughout the year mrs b yes but in winter it goes on in a very imperfect manner compared to the vegetation of spring and summer we have dwelt much longer on the history of vegetable chemistry than i had intended but we have at length i think brought the subject to a conclusion caroline i rather wonder that you did not reserve the account of the fermentations for the conclusion for the decomposition of vegetables naturally follows their death and can hardly it seems be introduced with so much propriety at any other period mrs b it is difficult to determine at what point precisely it may be most eligible to enter on the history of vegetation every part of the subject is so closely connected and forms such an uninterrupted chain that it is by no means easy to divide it had i begun with the germination of the seed which at first view seems to be the most proper arrangement i could not have explained the nature and fermentation of the seed or have described the changes which manure must undergo in order to yield the vegetable elements to understand the nature of germination it is necessary i think previously to decompose the parent plant in order to become acquainted with the materials required for that purpose i hope therefore that upon second consideration you will find that the order which i have adopted though apparently less correct is in fact the best calculated for the elucidation of the subject conversation xxiii on the composition of animals mrs b we are now come to the last branch of chemistry which comprehends the most complicated order of compound beings this is the animal creation the history of which cannot but excite the highest degree of curiosity and interest though we often fail in attempting to explain the laws by which it is governed emily but since all animals ultimately derive their nourishment from vegetables the chemistry of this order of beings must consist merely in the conversion of vegetable into animal matter mrs b very true but the manner in which this is effected is in a great measure concealed from our observation this process is called animalisation and is performed by peculiar organs the difference of the animal and vegetable kingdoms does not however depend merely on a different arrangement of combinations a new principle abounds in the animal kingdom which is but rarely and in very small quantities found in vegetables this is nitrogen there is likewise in animal substances a greater and more constant proportion of phosphoric acid and other saline matters but these are not essential to the formation of animal matter caroline animal compounds contain then four fundamental principles oxygen hydrogen carbon and nitrogen mrs b yes and these form the immediate materials of animals which are gelatine albumen and fibrine emily are those all i am surprised that animals should be composed of fewer kinds of materials than vegetables for they appear much more complicated in their organisation mrs b their organisation is certainly more perfect and intricate and the ingredients that occasionally enter into their composition are more numerous but notwithstanding the wonderful variety observable in the texture of the animal organs we find that the original compounds from which all the varieties of animal matter are derived may be reduced to the three heads just mentioned animal substances being the most complicated of all natural compounds are most easily susceptible of decomposition as the scale of attractions increases in proportion to the number of constituent principles their analysis is however both difficult and imperfect for as they cannot be examined in their living state and are liable to alteration immediately after death it is probable that when submitted to the investigation of a chemist they are always more or less altered in their combinations and properties from what they were whilst they made part of the living animal emily the mere diminution of temperature which they experience by the privation of animal heat must i should suppose be sufficient to derange the order of attractions that existed during life mrs b that is one of the causes no doubt but there are many other circumstances which prevent us from studying the nature of living animal substances we must therefore in a considerable degree confine our researches to the phenomena of these compounds in their inanimate state these three kinds of animal matter gelatine albumen and fibrine form the basis of all the various parts of the animal system either solid as the skin flesh nerves membranes cartilages and bones or fluid as blood chyle milk mucus the gastric and pancreatic juices bile perspiration saliva tears c caroline is it not surprising that so great a variety of substances and so different in their nature should yet all arise from so few materials and from the same original elements mrs b the difference in the nature of various bodies depends as i have often observed to you rather on their state of combination than on the materials of which they are composed thus in considering the chemical nature of the creation in a general point of view we observe that it is throughout composed of a very small number of elements but when we divide it into the three kingdoms we find that in the mineral the combinations seem to result from the union of elements casually brought together whilst in the vegetable and animal kingdoms the attractions are peculiarly and regularly produced by appropriate organs whose action depends on the vital principle and we may further observe that by means of certain spontaneous changes and decompositions the elements of one kind of matter become subservient to the reproduction of another so that the three kingdoms are intimately connected and constantly contributing to the preservation of each other emily there is however one very considerable class of elements which seems to be confined to the mineral kingdom i mean metals mrs b not entirely they are found though in very minute quantities both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms a small portion of earths and sulphur enters also into the composition of organised bodies phosphorus however is almost entirely confined to the animal kingdom and nitrogen but with few exceptions is extremely scarce in vegetables let us now proceed to examine the nature of the three principal materials of the animal system gelatine or jelly is the chief ingredient of skin and of all the membranous parts of animals it may be obtained from these substances by means of boiling water under the forms of glue size isinglass and transparent jelly caroline but these are of a very different nature they cannot therefore be all pure gelatine mrs b not entirely but very nearly so glue is extracted from the skin of animals size is obtained either from skin in its natural state or from leather isinglass is gelatine procured from a particular species of fish it is you know of this substance that the finest jelly is made and this is done by merely dissolving the isinglass in boiling water and allowing the solution to congeal emily the wine lemon and spices are i suppose added only to flavour the jelly mrs b exactly so caroline but jelly is often made of hartshorn shavings and of calves feet do these substances contain gelatine mrs b yes gelatine may be obtained from almost any animal substance as it enters more or less into the composition of all of them the process for obtaining it is extremely simple as it consists merely in boiling the substance that contains it with water the gelatine dissolves in water and may be attained of any degree of consistence or strength by evaporating this solution bones in particular produce it very plentifully as they consist of phosphat of lime combined or cemented by gelatine horns which are a species of bone will yield abundance of gelatine the horns of the hart are reckoned to produce gelatine of the finest quality they are reduced to the state of shavings in order that the jelly may be more easily extracted by the water it is of hartshorn shavings that the jellies for invalids are usually made as they are of very easy digestion caroline it appears singular that hartshorn which yields such a powerful ingredient as ammonia should at the same time produce so mild and insipid a substance as jelly mrs b and what is more surprising it is from the gelatine of bones that ammonia is produced you must observe however that the processes by which these two substances are obtained from bones are very different by the simple action of water and heat the gelatine is separated but in order to procure the ammonia or what is commonly called hartshorn the bones must be distilled by which means the gelatine is decomposed and hydrogen and nitrogen combined in the form of ammonia so that the first operation is a mere separation of ingredients whilst the second requires a chemical decomposition caroline but when jelly is made from hartshorn shavings what becomes of the phosphat of lime which constitutes the other part of bones mrs b it is easily separated by straining but the jelly is afterwards more perfectly purified and rendered transparent by adding white of egg which being coagulated by heat rises to the surface along with any impurities emily i wonder that bones are not used by the common people to make jelly a great deal of wholesome nourishment might i should suppose be procured from them though the jelly would perhaps not be quite so good as if made from hartshorn shavings mrs b there is a prejudice among the poor against a species of food that is usually thrown to the dogs and as we cannot expect them to enter into chemical considerations it is in some degree excusable besides it requires a prodigious quantity of fuel to dissolve bones and obtain the gelatine from them the solution of bones in water is greatly promoted by an accumulation of heat this may be effected by means of an extremely strong metallic vessel called papins digester in which the bones and water are enclosed without any possibility of the steam making its escape a heat can thus be applied much superior to that of boiling water and bones by this means are completely reduced to a pulp but the process still consumes too much fuel to be generally adopted among the lower classes caroline and why should not a manufacture be established for grinding or macerating bones or at least for reducing them to the state of shavings when i suppose they would dissolve as readily as hartshorn shavings mrs b they could not be collected clean for such a purpose but they are not lost as they are used for making hartshorn and sal ammoniac and such is the superior science and industry of this country that we now send sal ammoniac to the levant though it originally came to us from egypt emily when jelly is made of isinglass does it leave no sediment mrs b no nor does it so much require clarifying as it consists almost entirely of pure gelantine and any foreign matter that is mixed with it is thrown off during the boiling in the form of scum these are processes which you may see performed in great perfection in the culinary laboratory by that very able and most useful chemist the cook caroline to what an immense variety of purposes chemistry is subservient emily it appears in that respect to have an advantage over most other arts and sciences for these very often have a tendency to confine the imagination to their own particular object whilst the pursuit of chemistry is so extensive and diversified that it inspires a general curiosity and a desire of enquiring into the nature of every object caroline i suppose that soup is likewise composed of gelatine for when cold it often assumes the consistence of jelly mrs b not entirely for though soups generally contain a quantity of gelatine the most essential ingredient is a mucous or extractive matter a peculiar animal substance very soluble in water which has a strong taste and is more nourishing than gelatine the various kinds of portable soup consist of this extractive matter in a dry state which in order to be made into soup requires only to be dissolved in water gelatine in its solid state is a semiductile transparent substance without either taste or smell when exposed to heat in contact with air and water it first swells then fuses and finally burns you may have seen the first part of this operation performed in the carpenters gluepot caroline but you said that gelatine had no smell and glue has a very disagreeable one mrs b glue is not pure gelatine as it is not designed for eating it is prepared without attending to the state of the ingredients which are more or less contaminated by particles that have become putrid gelatine may be precipitated from its solution in water by alcohol we shall try this experiment with a glass of warm jelly you see that the gelatine subsides by the union of the alcohol and the water emily how is it then that jelly is flavoured with wine without producing any precipitation mrs b because the alcohol contained in wine is already combined with water and other ingredients and is therefore not at liberty to act upon the jelly as when in its separate state gelatine is soluble both in acids and in alkalies the former you know are frequently used to season jellies caroline among the combinations of gelatine we must not forget one which you formerly mentioned that with tannin to form leather mrs b true but you must observe that leather can be produced only by gelatine in a membranous state for though pure gelatine and tannin will produce a substance chemically similar to leather yet the texture of the skin is requisite to make it answer the useful purposes of that substance the next animal substance we are to examine is albumen this although constituting a part of most of the animal compounds is frequently found insulated in the animal system the white of egg for instance consists almost entirely of albumen the substance that composes the nerves the serum or white part of the blood and the curds of milk are little else than albumen variously modified in its most simple state albumen appears in the form of a transparent viscous fluid possessed of no distinct taste or smell it coagulates at the low temperature of 165 degrees and when once solidified it will never return to its fluid state sulphuric acid and alcohol are each of them capable of coagulating albumen in the same manner as heat as i am going to show you emily exactly so pray mrs b what kind of action is there between albumen and silver i have sometimes observed that if the spoon with which i eat an egg happens to be wetted it becomes tarnished mrs b it is because the white of egg and indeed albumen in general contains a little sulphur which at the temperature of an egg just boiled will decompose the drop of water that wets the spoon and produce sulphurated hydrogen gas which has the property of tarnishing silver we may now proceed to fibrine this is an insipid and inodorous substance having somewhat the appearance of fine white threads adhering together it is the essential constituent of muscles or flesh in which it is mixed with and softened by gelatine it is insoluble both in water and alcohol but sulphuric acid converts it into a substance very analogous to gelatine these are the essential and general ingredients of animal matter but there are other substances which though not peculiar to the animal system usually enter into its composition such as oils acids salts c animal oil is the chief constituent of fat it is contained in abundance in the cream of milk whence it is obtained in the form of butter emily is animal oil the same in its composition as vegetable oils mrs b not the same but very analogous the chief difference is that animal oil contains nitrogen a principle which seldom enters into the composition of vegetable oils and never in so large a proportion there are a few animal acids that is to say acids peculiar to animal matter from which they are almost exclusively obtained the animal acids have triple bases of hydrogen carbon and nitrogen some of them are found native in animal matter others are produced during its decomposition those that we find ready formed are the bombic acid which is obtained from silkworms the formic acid from ants the lactic acid from the whey of milk the sebacic from oil or fat those produced during the decomposition of animal substances by heat are the prussic and zoonic acids this last is produced by the roasting of meat and gives it a brisk flavour caroline the class of animal acids is not very extensive mrs b no nor are they generally speaking of great importance the prussic acid is i think the only one sufficiently interesting to require any further comment it can be formed by any artificial process without the presence of any animal matter and it may likewise be obtained from a variety of vegetables particularly those of the narcotic kind such as poppies laurel c but it is commonly obtained from blood by strongly heating that substance with caustic potash the alkali attracts the acid from the blood and forms with it a prussiat of potash from this state of combination the prussic acid can be obtained pure by means of other substances which have the power of separating it from the alkali emily but if this acid does not exist ready formed in blood how can the alkali attract it from it mrs b it is the triple basis only of this acid that exists in the blood and this is developed and brought to the state of acid during the combustion the acid therefore is first formed and it afterwards combines with the potash emily now i comprehend it but how can the prussic acid be artificially made mrs b by passing ammoniacal gas over redhot charcoal and hence we learn that the constituents of this acid are hydrogen nitrogen and carbon the two first are derived from the volatile alkali the last from the combustion of the charcoal caroline but this does not accord with the system of oxygen being the principle of acidity mrs b the colouring matter of prussian blue is called an acid because it unites with alkalies and metals and not from any other characteristic properties of acids perhaps the name is not strictly appropriate but this circumstance together with some others of the same kind has induced several chemists to think that oxygen may not be the exclusive generator of acids sir h davy i have already informed you was led by his experiments on dry acids to suspect that water might be essential to acidity and it is the opinion of some chemists that acidity may possibly depend rather on the arrangement than on the presence of any particular principles but we have not yet done with the prussic acid it has a strong affinity for metallic oxyds and precipitates the solutions of iron in acids of a blue colour this is the prussian blue or prussiat of iron so much used in the arts and with which i think you must be acquainted emily yes i am it is much used in painting both in oil and in water colours but it is not reckoned a permanent oilcolour mrs b that defect arises i believe in general from its being badly prepared which is the case when the iron is not so fully oxydated as to form a red oxyd for a solution of green oxyd of iron in which the metal is more slightly oxydated makes only a pale green or even a white precipitate with prussiat of potash and this gradually changes to blue by being exposed to the air as i can immediately show you caroline it already begins to assume a pale blue colour but how does the air produce this change mrs b by oxydating the iron more perfectly if we pour some nitrous acid on it the prussian blue colour will be immediately produced as the acid will yield its oxygen to the precipitate and fully saturate it with this principle as you shall see caroline it is very curious to see a colour change so instantaneously mrs b hence you perceive that prussian blue cannot be a permanent colour unless prepared with red oxyd of iron since by exposure to the atmosphere it gradually darkens and in a short time is no longer in harmony with the other colours of the painting caroline but it can never become darker by exposure to the atmosphere than the true prussian blue in which the oxyd is perfectly saturated mrs b certainly not but in painting the artist not reckoning upon partial alterations in his colours gives his blue tints that particular shade which harmonises with the rest of the picture if afterwards those tints become darker the harmony of the colouring must necessarily be destroyed caroline pray of what nature is the paint called carmine mrs b it is an animal colour prepared from cochineal an insect the infusion of which produces a very beautiful red caroline whilst we are on the subject of colours i should like to learn what ivory black is mrs b it is a carbonaceous substance obtained by the combustion of ivory a more common species of black is obtained from the burning of bone caroline but during the combustion of ivory or bone the carbon i should have imagined must be converted into carbonic acid gas instead of this black substance mrs b in this as in most combustions a considerable part of the carbon is simply volatilised by the heat and again obtained concrete on cooling this colour therefore may be called the soot produced by the burning of ivory or bone conversation xxiv on the animal economy mrs b we have now acquired some idea of the various materials that compose the animal system but if you are curious to know in what manner these substances are formed by the animal organs from vegetable as well as from animal substances it will be necessary to have some previous knowledge of the nature and functions of these organs without which it is impossible to form any distinct idea of the process of animalisation and nutrition caroline i do not exactly understand the meaning of the word animalisation mrs b animalisation is the process by which the food is assimilated that is to say converted into animal matter and nutrition is that by which the food thus assimilated is rendered subservient to the purposes of nourishing and maintaining the animal system emily this i am sure must be the most interesting of all the branches of chemistry caroline so i think particularly as i expect that we shall hear something of the nature of respiration and of the circulation of the blood mrs b these functions undoubtedly occupy a most important place in the history of the animal economy but i must previously give you a very short account of the principal organs by which the various operations of the animal system are performed these are the bones muscles blood vessels lymphatic vessels glands and nerves the bones are the most solid part of the animal frame and in a great measure determine its form and dimensions you recollect i suppose what are the ingredients which enter into their composition caroline yes phosphat of lime cemented by gelatine mrs b during the earliest period of animal life they consist almost entirely of gelatinous membrane having the form of the bones but of a loose spongy texture the cells or cavities of which are destined to be filled with phosphat of lime it is the gradual acquisition of this salt which gives to the bones their subsequent hardness and durability infants first receive it from their mothers milk and afterwards derive it from all animal and from most vegetable food especially farinaceous substances such as wheatflour which contain it in sensible quantities a portion of the phosphat after the bones of the infant have been sufficiently expanded and solidified is deposited in the teeth which consist at first only of a gelatinous membrane or case fitted for the reception of this salt and which after acquiring hardness within the gum gradually protrude from it caroline how very curious this is and how ingeniously nature has first provided for the solidification of such bones as are immediately wanted and afterwards for the formation of the teeth which would not only be useless but detrimental in infancy mrs b in quadrupeds the phosphat of lime is deposited likewise in their horns and in the hair or wool with which they are generally clothed in birds it serves also to harden the beaks and the quills of their feathers when animals are arrived at a state of maturity and their bones have acquired a sufficient degree of solidity the phosphat of lime which is taken with the food is seldom assimilated excepting when the female nourishes her young it is then all secreted into the milk as a provision for the tender bones of the nursling emily so that whatever becomes superfluous to one being is immediately wanted by another and the child acquires strength precisely by the species of nourishment which is no longer necessary to the mother nature is indeed an admirable economist caroline pray mrs b does not the disease in the bones of children called the rickets proceed from a deficiency of phosphat of lime mrs b i have heard that this disease may arise from two causes it is sometimes occasioned by the growth of the muscles being too rapid in proportion to that of the bones in this case the weight of the flesh is greater than the bones can support and presses upon them so as to produce a swelling of the joints which is the great indication of the rickets the other cause of this disorder is supposed to be an imperfect digestion and assimilation of the food attended with an excess of acid which counteracts the formation of phosphat of lime in both instances therefore care should be taken to alter the childs diet not merely by increasing the quantity of aliment containing phosphat of lime but also by avoiding all food that is apt to turn acid on the stomach and to produce indigestion but the best preservative against complaints of this kind is no doubt good nursing when a child has plenty of air and exercise the digestion and assimilation will be properly performed no acid will be produced to interrupt these functions and the muscles and bones will grow together in just proportions caroline i have often heard the rickets attributed to bad nursing but i never could have guessed what connection there was between exercise and the formation of the bones mrs b exercise is generally beneficial to all the animal functions if man is destined to labour for his subsistence the bread which he earns is scarcely more essential to his health and preservation than the exertions by which he obtains it those whom the gifts of fortune have placed above the necessity of bodily labour are compelled to take exercise in some mode or other and when they cannot convert it into an amusement they must submit to it as a task or their health will soon experience the effects of their indolence emily that will never be my case for exercise unless it becomes fatigue always gives me pleasure and so far from being a task is to me a source of daily enjoyment i often think what a blessing it is that exercise which is so conducive to health should be so delightful whilst fatigue which is rather hurtful instead of pleasure occasions painful sensations so that fatigue no doubt was intended to moderate our bodily exertions as satiety puts a limit to our appetites mrs b certainly but let us not deviate too far from our subject the bones are connected together by ligaments which consist of a white thick flexible substance adhering to their extremities so far as to secure the joints firmly though without impeding their motion and the joints are moreover covered by a solid smooth elastic white substance called cartilage the use of which is to allow by its smoothness and elasticity the bones to slide easily over one another so that the joints may perform their office without difficulty or detriment over the bones the muscles are placed they consist of bundles of fibres which terminate in a kind of string or ligament by which they are fastened to the bones the muscles are the organs of motion by their power of dilatation and contraction they put into action the bones which act as levers in all the motions of the body and form the solid support of its various parts the muscles are of various degrees of strength or consistence in different species of animals the mammiferous tribe or those that suckle their young seem in this respect to occupy an intermediate place between birds and coldblooded animals such as reptiles and fishes emily the different degrees of firmness and solidity in the muscles of these several species of animals proceed i imagine from the different nature of the food on which they subsist mrs b no that is not supposed to be the case for the human species who are of the mammiferous tribe live on more substantial food than birds and yet the latter exceed them in muscular strength we shall hereafter attempt to account for this difference but let us now proceed in the examination of the animal functions the next class of organs is that of the vessels of the body the office of which is to convey the various fluids throughout the frame these vessels are innumerable the most considerable of them are those through which the blood circulates which are of two kinds the arteries which convey it from the heart to the extremities of the body and the veins which bring it back into the heart besides these there are a numerous set of small transparent vessels destined to absorb and convey different fluids into the blood they are generally called the absorbent or lymphatic vessels but it is to a portion of them only that the function of conveying into the blood the fluid called lymph is assigned emily pray what is the nature of that fluid mrs b the nature and use of the lymph have i believe never been perfectly ascertained but it is supposed to consist of matter that has been previously animalised and which after answering the purpose for which it was intended must in regular rotation make way for the fresh supplies produced by nourishment the lymphatic vessels pump up this fluid from every part of the system and convey it into the veins to be mixed with the blood which runs through them and which is commonly called venous blood caroline but does it not again enter into the animal system through that channel mrs b not entirely for the venous blood does not return into the circulation until it has undergone a peculiar change in which it throws off whatever is become useless another set of absorbent vessels pump up the chyle from the stomach and intestines and convey it after many circumvolutions into the great vein near the heart emily pray what is chyle mrs b it is the substance into which food is converted by digestion caroline one set of the absorbent vessels then is employed in bringing away the old materials that are no longer fit for use whilst the other set is busy in conveying into the blood the new materials that are to replace them emily what a great variety of ingredients must enter into the composition of the blood mrs b you must observe that there is also a great variety of substances to be secreted from it we may compare the blood to a general receptacle or storehouse for all kinds of commodities which are afterwards fashioned arranged and disposed of as circumstances require there is another set of absorbent vessels in females which is destined to secrete milk for the nourishment of the young emily pray is not milk very analogous in its composition to blood for since the nursling derives its nourishment from that source only it must contain every principle which the animal system requires mrs b very true milk is found by its analysis to contain the principal materials of animal matter albumen oil and phosphat of lime so that the suckling has but little trouble to digest and assimilate this nourishment but we shall examine the composition of milk more fully afterwards in many parts of the body numbers of small vessels are collected together in little bundles called glands from a latin word meaning acorn on account of the resemblance which some of them bear in shape to that fruit the function of the glands is to secrete or separate certain matters from the blood the secretions are not only mechanical but chemical separations from the blood for the substances thus formed though contained in the blood are not ready combined in that fluid the secretions are of two kinds those which form peculiar animal fluids as bile tears saliva c and those which produce the general materials of the animal system for the purpose of recruiting and nourishing the several organs of the body such as albumen gelatine and fibrine the latter may be distinguished by the name of nutritive secretions caroline i am quite astonished to hear that all the secretions should be derived from the blood emily i thought that the bile was produced by the liver mrs b so it is but the liver is nothing more than a very large gland which secretes the bile from the blood the last of the animal organs which we have mentioned are the nerves these are the vehicles of sensation every other part of the body being of itself totally insensible caroline they must then be spread through every part of the frame for we are every where susceptible of feeling emily excepting the nails and the hair mrs b and those are almost the only parts in which nerves cannot be discovered the common source of all the nerves is the brain thence they descend some of them through different holes of the skull but the greatest part through the back bone and extend themselves by innumerable ramifications throughout the whole body they spread themselves over the muscles penetrate the glands wind round the vascular system and even pierce into the interior of the bones it is most probably through them that the communication is carried on between the mind and the other parts of the body but in what manner they are acted on by the mind and made to react on the body is still a profound secret many hypotheses have been formed on this very obscure subject but they are all equally improbable and it would be useless for us to waste our time in conjectures on an enquiry which in all probability is beyond the reach of human capacity caroline but you have not mentioned those particular nerves that form the senses of hearing seeing smelling and tasting mrs b they are considered as being of the same nature as those which are dispersed over every part of the body and constitute the general sense of feeling the different sensations which they produce arise from their peculiar situation and connection with the several organs of taste smell and hearing emily but these senses appear totally different from that of feeling mrs b they are all of them sensations but variously modified according to the nature of the different organs in which the nerves are situated for as we have formerly observed it is by contact only that the nerves are affected thus odoriferous particles must strike upon the nerves of the nose in order to excite the sense of smelling in the same manner that taste is produced by the particular substance coming in contact with the nerves of the palate it is thus also that the sensation of sound is produced by the concussion of the air striking against the auditory nerve and sight is the effect of the light falling upon the optic nerve these various senses therefore are affected only by the actual contact of particles of matter in the same manner as that of feeling the different organs of the animal body though easily separated and perfectly distinct are loosely connected together by a kind of spongy substance in texture somewhat resembling network called the cellular membrane and the whole is covered by the skin the skin as well as the bark of vegetables is formed of three coats the external one is called the cuticle or epidermis the second which is called the mucous membrane is of a thin soft texture and consists of a mucous substance which in negroes is black and is the cause of their skin appearing of that colour caroline is then the external skin of negroes white like ours mrs b yes but as the cuticle is transparent as well as porous the blackness of the mucous membrane is visible through it the extremities of the nerves are spread over this skin so that the sensation of feeling is transmitted through the cuticle the internal covering of the muscles which is properly the skin is the thickest the toughest and most resisting of the whole it is this membrane which is so essential in the arts by forming leather when combined with tannin the skin which covers the animal body as well as those membranes that form the coats of the vessels consists almost exclusively of gelatine and is capable of being converted into glue size or jelly the cavities between the muscles and the skin are usually filled with fat which lodges in the cells of the membranous net before mentioned and gives to the external form especially in the human figure that roundness smoothness and softness so essential to beauty emily and the skin itself is i think a very ornamental part of the human frame both from the fineness of its texture and the variety and delicacy of its tints mrs b this variety and harmonious graduation of colours proceed not so much from the skin itself as from the internal organs which transmit their several colours through it these being only softened and blended by the colour of the skin which is uniformly of a yellowish white thus modified the darkness of the veins appears of a pale blue colour and the floridness of the arteries is changed to a delicate pink in the most transparent parts the skin exhibits the bloom of the rose whilst where it is more opake its own colour predominates and at the joints where the bones are most prominent their whiteness is often discernible in a word every part of the human frame seems to contribute to its external grace and this not merely by producing a pleasing variety of tints but by a peculiar kind of beauty which belongs to each individual part thus it is to the solidity and arrangement of the bones that the human figure owes the grandeur of its stature and its firm and dignified deportment the muscles delineate the form and stamp it with energy and grace and the soft substance which is spread over them smooths their ruggedness and gives to the contours the gentle undulations of the line of beauty every organ of sense is a peculiar and separate ornament and the skin which polishes the surface and gives it that charm of colouring so inimitable by art finally conspires to render the whole the fairest work of the creation but now that we have seen in what manner the animal frame is formed let us observe how it provides for its support and how the several organs which form so complete a whole are nourished and maintained this will lead us to a more particular explanation of the internal organs here we shall not meet with so much apparent beauty because these parts were not intended by nature to be exhibited to view but the beauty of design in the internal organisation of the animal frame is if possible still more remarkable than that of the external parts we shall defer this subject till our next interview conversation xxv on animalisation nutrition and respiration mrs b we have now learnt of what materials the animal system is composed and have formed some idea of the nature of its organisation in order to complete the subject it remains for us to examine in what manner it is nourished and supported vegetables we have observed obtain their nourishment from various substances either in their elementary state or in a very simple state of combination as carbon water and salts which they pump up from the soil and carbonic acid and oxygen which they absorb from the atmosphere animals on the contrary feed on substances of the most complicated kind for they derive their sustenance some from the animal creation others from the vegetable kingdom and some from both caroline and there is one species of animals which not satisfied with enjoying either kind of food in its simple state has invented the art of combining them together in a thousand ways and of rendering even the mineral kingdom subservient to its refinements emily nor is this all for our delicacies are collected from the various climates of the earth so that the four quarters of the globe are often obliged to contribute to the preparation of our simplest dishes caroline but the very complicated substances which constitute the nourishment of animals do not i suppose enter into their system in their actual state of combination mrs b so far from it that they not only undergo a new arrangement of their parts but a selection is made of such as are most proper for the nourishment of the body and those only enter into the system and are animalised emily and by what organs is this process performed mrs b chiefly by the stomach which is the organ of digestion and the prime regulator of the animal frame digestion is the first step towards nutrition it consists in reducing into one homogeneous mass the various substances that are taken as nourishment it is performed by first chewing and mixing the solid aliment with the saliva which reduces it to a soft mass in which state it is conveyed into the stomach where it is more completely dissolved by the gastric juice this fluid which is secreted into the stomach by appropriate glands is so powerful a solvent that scarcely any substances will resist its action emily the coats of the stomach however cannot be attacked by it otherwise we should be in danger of having them destroyed when the stomach was empty mrs b they are probably not subject to its action as long at least as life continues but it appears that when the gastric juice has no foreign substance to act upon it is capable of occasioning a degree of irritation in the coats of the stomach which produces the sensation of hunger the gastric juice together with the heat and muscular action of the stomach converts the aliment into an uniform pulpy mass called chyme this passes into the intestines where it meets with the bile and some other fluids by the agency of which and by the operation of other causes hitherto unknown the chyme is changed into chyle a much thinner substance somewhat resembling milk which is pumped by immense numbers of small absorbent vessels spread over the internal surface of the intestines these after many circumvolutions gradually meet and unite into large branches till they at length collect the chyle into one vessel which pours its contents into the great vein near the heart by which means the food thus prepared enters into the circulation caroline but i do not yet clearly understand how the blood thus formed nourishes the body and supplies all the secretions mrs b before this can be explained to you you must first allow me to complete the formation of the blood the chyle may indeed be considered as forming the chief ingredient of blood but this fluid is not perfect until it has passed through the lungs and undergone together with the blood that has already circulated certain necessary changes that are effected by respiration caroline i am very glad that you are going to explain the nature of respiration i have often longed to understand it for though we talk incessantly of breathing i never knew precisely what purpose it answered mrs b it is indeed one of the most interesting processes imaginable but in order to understand this function well it will be necessary to enter into some previous explanations tell me emily what do you understand by respiration emily respiration i conceive consists simply in alternately inspiring air into the lungs and expiring it from them mrs b your answer will do very well as a general definition but in order to form a tolerably clear notion of the various phenomena of respiration there are many circumstances to be taken into consideration in the first place there are two things to be distinguished in respiration the mechanical and the chemical part of the process the mechanism of breathing depends on the alternate expansions and contractions of the chest in which the lungs are contained when the chest dilates the cavity is enlarged and the air rushes in at the mouth to fill up the vacuum formed by this dilatation when it contracts the cavity is diminished and the air forced out again caroline i thought that it was the lungs that contracted and expanded in breathing mrs b they do likewise but their action is only the consequence of that of the chest the lungs together with the heart and largest blood vessels in a manner fill up the cavity of the chest they could not therefore dilate if the chest did not previously expand and on the other hand when the chest contracts it compresses the lungs and forces the air out of them caroline the lungs then are like bellows and the chest is the power that works them mrs b precisely so here is a curious little figure plate xv fig 5 that will assist me in explaining the mechanism of breathing caroline what a droll figure a little head fixed upon a glass bell with a bladder tied over the bottom of it mrs b you must observe that there is another bladder within the glass the neck of which communicates with the mouth of the figurethis represents the lungs contained within the chest the other bladder which you see is tied loose represents a muscular membrane called the diaphragm which separates the chest from the lower part of the body by the chest therefore i mean that large cavity in the upper part of the body contained within the ribs the neck and the diaphragm this membrane is muscular and capable of contraction and dilatation the contraction may be imitated by drawing the bladder tight over the bottom of the receiver when the air in the bladder which represents the lungs will be forced out through the mouth of the figure emily see caroline how it blows the flame of the candle in breathing mrs b by letting the bladder loose again we imitate the dilatation of the diaphragm and the cavity of the chest being enlarged the lungs expand and the air rushes in to fill them emily this figure i think gives a very clear idea of the process of breathing mrs b it illustrates tolerably well the action of the lungs and diaphragm but those are not the only powers that are concerned in enlarging or diminishing the cavity of the chest the ribs are also possessed of a muscular motion for the same purpose they are alternately drawn in edgeways to assist the contraction and stretched out like the hoops of a barrel to contribute to the dilatation of the chest emily i always supposed that the elevation and depression of the ribs were the consequence not the cause of breathing mrs b it is exactly the reverse the muscular action of the diaphragm together with that of the ribs are the causes of the contraction and expansion of the chest and the air rushing into and being expelled from the lungs are only consequences of those actions caroline i confess that i thought the act of breathing began by opening the mouth for the air to rush in and that it was the air alone which by alternately rushing in and out occasioned the dilatations and contractions of the lungs and chest mrs b try the experiment of merely opening your mouth the air will not rush in till by an interior muscular action you produce a vacuumyes just so your diaphragm is now dilated and the ribs expanded but you will not be able to keep them long in that state your lungs and chest are already resuming their former state and expelling the air with which they had just been filled this mechanism goes on more or less rapidly but in general a person at rest and in health will breathe between fifteen and twentyfive times in a minute we may now proceed to the chemical effects of respiration but for this purpose it is necessary that you should previously have some notion of the circulation of the blood tell me caroline what do you understand by the circulation of the blood caroline i am delighted that you come to that subject for it is one that has long excited my curiosity but i cannot conceive how it is connected with respiration the idea i have of the circulation is that the blood runs from the heart through the veins all over the body and back again to the heart mrs b i could hardly have expected a better definition from you it is however not quite correct for you do not distinguish the arteries from the veins which as we have already observed are two distinct sets of vessels each having its own peculiar functions the arteries convey the blood from the heart to the extremities of the body and the veins bring it back into the heart this sketch will give you an idea of the manner in which some of the principal veins and arteries of the human body branch out of the heart which may be considered as a common centre to both sets of vessels the heart is a kind of strong elastic bag or muscular cavity which possesses a power of dilating and contracting itself for the purposes of alternately receiving and expelling the blood in order to carry on the process of circulation emily why are the arteries in this drawing painted red and the veins purple mrs b it is to point out the difference of the colour of the blood in these two sets of vessels caroline but if it is the same blood that flows from the arteries into the veins how can its colour be changed mrs b this change arises from various circumstances in the first place during its passage through the arteries the blood undergoes a considerable alteration some of its constituent parts being gradually separated from it for the purpose of nourishing the body and of supplying the various secretions the consequence of this is that the florid arterial colour of the blood changes by degrees to a deep purple which is its constant colour in the veins on the other hand the blood is recruited during its return through the veins by the fresh chyle or imperfect blood which has been produced by food and it receives also lymph from the absorbent vessels as we have before mentioned in consequence of these several changes the blood returns to the heart in a state very different from that in which it left it it is loaded with a greater proportion of hydrogen and carbon and is no longer fit for the nourishment of the body or other purposes of circulation emily and in this state does it mix in the heart with the pure florid blood that runs into the arteries mrs b no the heart is divided into two cavities or compartitions called the right and left ventricles the left ventricle is the receptacle for the pure arterial blood previous to its circulation whilst the venous or impure blood which returns to the heart after having circulated is received into the right ventricle previous to its purification which i shall presently explain caroline for my part i always thought that the same blood circulated again and again through the body without undergoing any change mrs b yet you must have supposed that the blood circulated for some purpose caroline i knew that it was indispensable to life but had no idea of its real functions mrs b but now that you understand that the blood conveys nourishment to every part of the body and supplies the various secretions you must be sensible that it cannot constantly answer these objects without being proportionally renovated and purified caroline but does not the chyle answer this purpose mrs b only in part it renovates the nutritive principles of the blood but does not relieve it from the superabundance of water and carbon with which it is encumbered emily how then is this effected mrs b by respiration this is one of the grand mysteries which modern chemistry has disclosed when the venous blood enters the right ventricle of the heart it contracts by its muscular power and throws the blood through a large vessel into the lungs which are contiguous and through which it circulates by millions of small ramifications here it comes in contact with the air which we breathe the action of the air on the blood in the lungs is indeed concealed from our immediate observation but we are able to form a tolerably accurate judgment of it from the changes which it effects not only in the blood but also on the air expired the air after passing through the lungs is found to contain all the nitrogen inspired but to have lost part of its oxygen and to have acquired a portion of watery vapour and of carbonic acid gas hence it is inferred that when the air comes in contact with the venous blood in the lungs the oxygen attracts from it the superabundant quantity of carbon with which it has impregnated itself during the circulation and converts it into carbonic acid this gaseous acid together with the redundant moisture from the lungs being then expired the blood is restored to its former purity that is to the state of arterial blood and is thus again enabled to perform its various functions footnote the quantity of moisture discharged by the lungs in 24 hours may be computed at eight or nine ounces caroline this is truly wonderful of all that we have yet learned i do not recollect any thing that has appeared to me so curious and interesting i almost believe that i should like to study anatomy now though i have hitherto had so disgusting an idea of it pray to whom are we indebted for these beautiful discoveries mrs b priestley and crawford in this country and lavoisier in france are the principal inventors of the theory of respiration of late years the subject has been farther illustrated and simplified by the accurate experiments of messrs allen and pepys but the still more important and more admirable discovery of the circulation of the blood was made long before by our immortal countryman harvey emily indeed i never heard any thing that delighted me so much as this theory of respiration but i hope mrs b that you will enter a little more into particulars before you dismiss so interesting a subject we left the blood in the lungs to undergo the salutary change but how does it thence spread to all the parts of the body mrs b after circulating through the lungs the blood is collected into four large vessels by which it is conveyed into the left ventricle of the heart whence it is propelled to all the different parts of the body by a large artery which gradually ramifies into millions of small arteries through the whole frame from the extremities of these little ramifications the blood is transmitted to the veins which bring it back to the heart and lungs to go round again and again in the manner we have just described you see therefore that the blood actually undergoes two circulations the one through the lungs by which it is converted into pure arterial blood the other or general circulation by which nourishment is conveyed to every part of the body and these are both equally indispensable to the support of animal life emily but whence proceeds the carbon with which the blood is impregnated when it comes into the lungs mrs b carbon exists in a greater proportion in blood than in organised animal matter the blood therefore after supplying its various secretions becomes loaded with an excess of carbon which is carried off by respiration and the formation of new chyle from the food affords a constant supply of carbonaceous matter caroline i wonder what quantity of carbon may be expelled from the blood by respiration in the course of 24 hours mrs b it appears by the experiments of messrs allen and pepys that about 40000 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas are emitted from the lungs of a healthy person daily which is equivalent to eleven ounces of solid carbon every 24 hours emily what an immense quantity and pray how much of carbonic acid gas do we expel from our lungs at each expiration mrs b the quantity of air which we take into our lungs at each inspiration is about 40 cubic inches which contain a little less than 10 cubic inches of oxygen and of those 10 inches oneeighth is converted into carbonic acid gas on passing once through the lungs a change which is sufficient to prevent air which has only been breathed once from suffering a taper to burn in it footnote the bulk of carbonic acid gas formed by respiration is exactly the same as that of the oxygen gas which disappears caroline pray how does the air come in contact with the blood in the lungs mrs b i cannot answer this question without entering into an explanation of the nature and structure of the lungs you recollect that the venous blood on being expelled from the right ventricle enters the lungs to go through what we may call the lesser circulation the large trunk or vessel that conveys it branches out at its entrance into the lungs into an infinite number of very fine ramifications the windpipe which conveys the air from the mouth into the lungs likewise spreads out into a corresponding number of air vessels which follow the same course as the blood vessels forming millions of very minute aircells these two sets of vessels are so interwoven as to form a sort of network connected into a kind of spongy mass in which every particle of blood must necessarily come in contact with a particle of air caroline but since the blood and the air are contained in different vessels how can they come into contact mrs b they act on each other through the membrane which forms the coats of these vessels for although this membrane prevents the blood and the air from mixing together in the lungs yet it is no impediment to their chemical action on each other emily are the lungs composed entirely of blood vessels and air vessels mrs b i believe they are with the addition only of nerves and of a small quantity of the cellular substance before mentioned which connects the whole into an uniform mass emily pray why are the lungs always spoken of in the plural number are there more than one mrs b yes for though they form but one organ they really consist of two compartments called lobes which are enclosed in separate membranes or bags each occupying one side of the chest and being in close contact with each other but without communicating together this is a beautiful provision of nature in consequence of which if one of the lobes be wounded the other performs the whole process of respiration till the first is healed the blood thus completed by the process of respiration forms the most complex of all animal compounds since it contains not only the numerous materials necessary to form the various secretions as saliva tears c but likewise all those that are required to nourish the several parts of the body as the muscles bones nerves glands c emily there seems to be a singular analogy between the blood of animals and the sap of vegetables for each of these fluids contains the several materials destined for the nutrition of the numerous class of bodies to which they respectively belong mrs b nor is the production of these fluids in the animal and vegetable systems entirely different for the absorbent vessels which pump up the chyle from the stomach and intestines may be compared to the absorbents of the roots of plants which suck up the nourishment from the soil and the analogy between the sap and the blood may be still further traced if we follow the latter in the course of its circulation for in the living animal we find every where organs which are possessed of a power to secrete from the blood and appropriate to themselves the ingredients requisite for their support caroline but whence do these organs derive their respective powers mrs b from a peculiar organisation the secret of which no one has yet been able to unfold but it must be ultimately by means of the vital principle that both their mechanical and chemical powers are brought into action i cannot dismiss the subject of circulation without mentioning perspiration a secretion which is immediately connected with it and acts a most important part in the animal economy caroline is not this secretion likewise made by appropriate glands mrs b no it is performed by the extremities of the arteries which penetrate through the skin and terminate under the cuticle through the pores of which the perspiration issues when this fluid is not secreted in excess it is insensible because it is dissolved by the air as it exudes from the pores but when it is secreted faster than it can be dissolved it becomes sensible as it assumes its liquid state emily this secretion bears a striking resemblance to the transpiration of the sap of plants they both consist of the most fluid part and both exude from the surface by the extremities of the vessels through which they circulate mrs b and the analogy does not stop there for since it has been ascertained that the sap returns into the roots of the plants the resemblance between the animal and vegetable circulation is become still more obvious the latter however is far from being complete since as we observed before it consists only in a rising and descending of the sap whilst in animals the blood actually circulates through every part of the system we have now i think traced the process of nutrition from the introduction of the food into the stomach to its finally becoming a constituent part of the animal frame this will therefore be a fit period to conclude our present conversation what further remarks we have to make on the animal economy shall be reserved for our next interview conversation xxvi on animal heat and on various animal products emily since our last interview i have been thinking much of the theory of respiration and i cannot help being struck with the resemblance which it appears to bear to the process of combustion for in respiration as in most cases of combustion the air suffers a change and a portion of its oxygen combines with carbon producing carbonic acid gas mrs b i am much pleased that this idea has occurred to you these two processes appear so very analogous that it has been supposed that a kind of combustion actually takes place in the lungs not of the blood but of the superfluous carbon which the oxygen attracts from it caroline a combustion in our lungs that is a curious idea indeed but mrs b how can you call the action of the air on the blood in the lungs combustion when neither light nor heat are produced by it emily i was going to make the same objection yet i do not conceive how the oxygen can combine with the carbon and produce carbonic acid without disengaging heat mrs b the fact is that heat is disengaged whether any light be evolved i cannot pretend to determine but that heat is produced in considerable and very sensible quantities is certain and this is the principal if not the only source of animal heat footnote it has been calculated that the heat produced by respiration in 12 hours in the lungs of a healthy person is such as would melt about 100 pounds of ice emily how wonderful that the very process which purifies and elaborates the blood should afford an inexhaustible supply of internal heat mrs b this is the theory of animal heat in its original simplicity such nearly as it was first proposed by black and lavoisier it was equally clear and ingenious and was at first generally adopted but it was objected on second consideration that if the whole of the animal heat was evolved in the lungs it would necessarily be much less in the extremities of the body than immediately at its source which is not found to be the case this objection however which was by no means frivolous is now satisfactorily removed by the following consideration venous blood has been found by experiment to have less capacity for heat than arterial blood whence it follows that the blood in gradually passing from the arterial to the venous state during the circulation parts with a portion of caloric by means of which heat is diffused through every part of the body emily more and more admirable caroline the cause of animal heat was always a perfect mystery to me and i am delighted with its explanation but pray mrs b can you tell me what is the reason of the increase of heat that takes place in a fever emily is it not because we then breathe quicker and therefore more heat is disengaged in the system mrs b that may be one reason but i should think that the principal cause of the heat experienced in fevers is that there is no vent for the caloric which is generated in the body one of the most considerable secretions is the insensible perspiration this is constantly carrying off caloric in a latent state but during the hot stage of a fever the pores are so contracted that all perspiration ceases and the accumulation of caloric in the body occasions those burning sensations which are so painful emily this is no doubt the reason why the perspiration that often succeeds the hot stage of a fever affords so much relief if i had known this theory of animal heat when i had a fever last summer i think i should have found some amusement in watching the chemical processes that were going on within me caroline but exercise likewise produces animal heat and that must be quite in a different manner mrs b not so much so as you think for the more exercise you take the more the body is stimulated and requires recruiting for this purpose the circulation of the blood is quickened the breath proportionably accelerated and consequently a greater quantity of caloric evolved caroline true after running very fast i gasp for breath my respiration is quick and hard and it is just then that i begin to feel hot emily it would seem then that violent exercise should produce fever mrs b not if the person is in a good state of health for the additional caloric is then carried off by the perspiration which succeeds emily what admirable resources nature has provided for us by the production of animal heat she has enabled us to keep up the temperature of our bodies above that of inanimate objects and whenever this source becomes too abundant the excess is carried off by perspiration mrs b it is by the same law of nature that we are enabled in all climates and in all seasons to preserve our bodies of an equal temperature or at least very nearly so caroline you cannot mean to say that our bodies are of the same temperature in summer and in winter in england and in the westindies mrs b yes i do at least if you speak of the temperature of the blood and the internal parts of the body for those parts that are immediately in contact with the atmosphere such as the hands and face will occasionally get warmer or colder than the internal or more sheltered parts but if you put the bulb of a thermometer in your mouth which is the best way of ascertaining the real temperature of your body you will scarcely perceive any difference in its indication whatever may be the difference of temperature of the atmosphere caroline and when i feel overcome by heat i am really not hotter than when i am shivering with cold mrs b when a person in health feels very hot whether from internal heat from violent exercise or from the temperature of the atmosphere his body is certainly a little warmer than when he feels very cold but this difference is much smaller than our sensations would make us believe and the natural standard is soon restored by rest and by perspiration it is chiefly the external parts that are warmer and i am sure that you will be surprised to hear that the internal temperature of the body scarcely ever descends below ninetyfive or ninetysix degrees and seldom attains one hundred and four or one hundred and five degrees even in the most violent fevers emily the greater quantity of caloric therefore that we receive from the atmosphere in summer cannot raise the temperature of our bodies beyond certain limits as it does that of inanimate bodies because an excess of caloric is carried off by perspiration caroline but the temperature of the atmosphere and consequently that of inanimate bodies is surely never so high as that of animal heat mrs b i beg your pardon frequently in the east and west indies and sometimes in the southern parts of europe the atmosphere is above ninetyeight degrees which is the common temperature of animal heat indeed even in this country it occasionally happens that the suns rays setting full on an object elevate its temperature above that point in illustration of the power which our bodies have to resist the effects of external heat sir charles blagden with some other gentlemen made several very curious experiments he remained for some time in an oven heated to a temperature not much inferior to that of boiling water without suffering any other inconvenience than a profuse perspiration which he supported by drinking plentifully emily he could scarcely consider the perspiration as an inconvenience since it saved him from being baked by giving vent to the excess of caloric caroline i always thought i confess that it was from the heat of the perspiration that we suffered in summer mrs b you now find that you are quite mistaken whenever evaporation takes place cold you know is produced in consequence of a quantity of caloric being carried off in a latent state this is the case with perspiration and it is in this way that it affords relief it is on that account also that we are so apt to catch cold when in a state of profuse perspiration it is for the same reason that tea is often refreshing in summer though it appears to heat you at the moment you drink it emily and in winter on the contrary tea is pleasant on account of its heat mrs b yes for we have then rather to guard against a deficiency than an excess of caloric and you do not find that tea will excite perspiration in winter unless after dancing or any other violent exercise caroline what is the reason that it is dangerous to eat ice after dancing or to drink any thing cold when one is very hot mrs b because the loss of heat arising from the perspiration conjointly with the chill occasioned by the cold draught produce more cold than can be borne with safety unless you continue to use the same exercise after drinking that you did before for the heat occasioned by the exercise will counteract the effects of the cold drink and the danger will be removed you may however contrary to the common notion consider it as a rule that cold liquids may at all times be drunk with perfect safety however hot you may feel provided you are not at the moment in a state of great perspiration and on condition that you keep yourself in gentle exercise afterwards emily but since we are furnished with such resources against the extremes of heat or cold i should have thought that all climates would have been equally wholesome mrs b that is true in a certain degree with regard to those who have been accustomed to them from birth for we find that the natives of those climates which we consider as most deleterious are as healthy as ourselves and if such climates are unwholesome to those who are habituated to a more moderate temperature it is because the animal economy does not easily accustom itself to considerable changes caroline but pray mrs b if the circulation preserves the body of an uniform temperature how does it happen that animals are sometimes frozen mrs b because if more heat be carried off by the atmosphere than the circulation can supply the cold will finally prevail the heart will cease to beat and the animal will be frozen and likewise if the body remained long exposed to a degree of heat greater than the perspiration could carry off it would at last lose the power of resisting its destructive influence caroline fish i suppose have no animal heat but only partake of the temperature of the water in which they live emily and their coldness no doubt proceeds from their not breathing mrs b all kinds of fish breathe more or less though in a much smaller degree than land animals nor are they entirely destitute of animal heat though for the same reason they are much colder than other creatures they have comparatively but a very small quantity of blood therefore but very little oxygen is required and a proportionally small quantity of animal heat is generated caroline but how can fish breathe under water mrs b they breathe by means of the air which is dissolved in the water and if you put them into water deprived of air by boiling they are soon suffocated if a fish is confined in a vessel of water closed from the air it soon dies and any fish put in afterwards would be killed immediately as all the air had been previously consumed caroline are there any species of animals that breathe more than we do mrs b yes birds of all animals breathe the greatest quantity of air in proportion to their size and it is to this that they are supposed to owe the peculiar firmness and strength of their muscles by which they are enabled to support the violent exertion of flying this difference between birds and fish which may be considered as the two extremes of the scale of muscular strength is well worth observing birds residing constantly in the atmosphere surrounded by oxygen and respiring it in greater proportions than any other species of animals are endowed with a superior degree of muscular strength whilst the muscles of fish on the contrary are flaccid and oily these animals are comparatively feeble in their motions and their temperature is scarcely above that of the water in which they live this is in all probability owing to their imperfect respiration the quantity of hydrogen and carbon that is in consequence accumulated in their bodies forms the oil which is so strongly characteristic of that species of animals and which relaxes and softens the small quantity of fibrine which their muscles contain caroline but mrs b there are some species of birds that frequent both elements as for instance ducks and other water fowl of what nature is the flesh of these mrs b such birds in general make but little use of their wings if they fly it is but feebly and only to a short distance their flesh too partakes of the oily nature and even in taste sometimes resembles that of fish this is the case not only with the various kinds of water fowls but with all other amphibious animals as the otter the crocodile the lizard c caroline and what is the reason that reptiles are so deficient in muscular strength mrs b it is because they usually live under ground and seldom come into the atmosphere they have imperfect and sometimes no discernible organs of respiration they partake therefore of the soft oily nature of fish indeed many of them are amphibious as frogs toads and snakes and very few of them find any difficulty in remaining a length of time under water whilst on the contrary the insect tribe that are so strong in proportion to their size and alert in their motions partake of the nature of birds air being their peculiar element and their organs of respiration being comparatively larger than in other classes of animals i have now given you a short account of the principal animal functions however interesting the subject may appear to you a fuller investigation of it would i fear lead us too far from our object emily yet i shall not quit it without much regret for of all the branches of chemistry it is certainly the most curious and most interesting caroline but mrs b i must remind you that you promised to give us some account of the nature of milk mrs b true there are several other animal productions that deserve likewise to be mentioned we shall begin with milk which is certainly the most important and the most interesting of all the animal secretions milk like all other animal substances ultimately yields by analysis oxygen hydrogen carbon and nitrogen these are combined in it under the forms of albumen gelatine oil and water but milk contains besides a considerable portion of phosphat of lime the purposes of which i have already pointed out caroline yes it is this salt which serves to nourish the tender bones of the suckling mrs b to reduce milk to its elements would be a very complicated as well as useless operation but this fluid without any chemical assistance may be decomposed into three parts cream curds and whey these constituents of milk have but a very slight affinity for each other and you find accordingly that cream separates from milk by mere standing it consists chiefly of oil which being lighter than the other parts of the milk gradually rises to the surface it is of this you know that butter is made which is nothing more than oxygenated cream caroline butter then is somewhat analogous to the waxy substance formed by the oxygenation of vegetable oils mrs b very much so emily but is the cream oxygenated by churning mrs b its oxygenation commences previous to churning merely by standing exposed to the atmosphere from which it absorbs oxygen the process is afterwards completed by churning the violent motion which this operation occasions brings every particle of cream in contact with the atmosphere and thus facilitates its oxygenation caroline but the effect of churning i have often observed in the dairy is to separate the cream into two substances butter and buttermilk mrs b that is to say in proportion as the oily particles of the cream become oxygenated they separate from the other constituent parts of the cream in the form of butter so by churning you produce on the one hand butter or oxygenated oil and on the other buttermilk or cream deprived of oil but if you make butter by churning new milk instead of cream the buttermilk will then be exactly similar in its properties to creamed or skimmed milk caroline yet buttermilk is very different from common skimmed milk mrs b because you know it is customary in order to save time and labour to make butter from cream alone in this case therefore the buttermilk is deprived of the creamed milk which contains both the curd and whey besides in consequence of the milk remaining exposed to the atmosphere during the separation of the cream the latter becomes more or less acid as well as the buttermilk which it yields in churning emily why should not the butter be equally acidified by oxygenation mrs b animal oil is not so easily acidified as the other ingredients of milk butter therefore though usually made of sour cream is not sour itself because the oily part of the cream had not been acidified butter however is susceptible of becoming acid by an excess of oxygen it is then said to be rancid and produces the sebacic acid the same as that which is obtained from fat emily if that be the case might not rancid butter be sweetened by mixing with it some substance that would take the acid from it mrs b this idea has been suggested by sir h davy who supposes that if rancid butter were well washed in an alkaline solution the alkali would separate the acid from the butter caroline you said just now that creamed milk consisted of curd and whey pray how are these separated mrs b they may be separated by standing for a certain length of time exposed to the atmosphere but this decomposition may be almost instantaneously effected by the chemical agency of a variety of substances alkalies rennet and indeed almost all animal substances decompose milk by combining with the curds acids and spirituous liquors on the other hand produce a decomposition by combining with the whey in order therefore to obtain the whey pure rennet or alkaline substances must be used to attract the curds from it but if it be wished to obtain the curds pure the whey must be separated by acids wine or other spirituous liquors footnote rennet is the name given to a watery infusion of the coats of the stomach of a sucking calf its remarkable efficacy in promoting coagulation is supposed to depend on the gastric juice with which it is impregnated emily this is a very useful piece of information for i find whitewine whey which i sometimes take when i have a cold extremely heating now if the whey were separated by means of an alkali instead of wine it would not produce that effect mrs b perhaps not but i would strenuously advise you not to place too much reliance on your slight chemical knowledge in medical matters i do not know why whey is not separated from curd by rennet or by an alkali for the purpose which you mention but i strongly suspect that there must be some good reason why the preparation by means of wine is generally preferred i can however safely point out to you a method of obtaining whey without either alkali rennet or wine it is by substituting lemon juice a very small quantity of which will separate it from the curds whey as an article of diet is very wholesome being remarkable light of digestion but its effect taken medicinally is chiefly i believe to excite perspiration by being drunk warm on going to bed from whey a substance may be obtained in crystals by evaporation called sugar of milk this substance is sweet to the taste and in its composition is so analogous to common sugar that it is susceptible of undergoing the vinous fermentation caroline why then is not wine or alcohol made from whey mrs b the quantity of sugar contained in milk is so trifling that it can hardly answer that purpose i have heard of only one instance of its being used for the production of a spirituous liquor and this is by the tartan arabs their abundance of horses as well as their scarcity of fruits has introduced the fermentation of mares milk by which they produce a liquor called koumiss whey is likewise susceptible of being acidified by combining with oxygen from the atmosphere it then produces the lactic acid which you may recollect is mentioned amongst the animal acids as the acid of milk let us now see what are the properties of curds emily i know that they are made into cheese but i have heard that for that purpose they are separated from the whey by rennet and yet this you have just told us is not the method of obtaining pure curds mrs b nor are pure curds so well adapted for the formation of cheese for the nature and flavour of the cheese depend in a great measure upon the cream or oily matter which is left in the curds so that if every particle of cream be removed from the curds the cheese is scarcely eatable rich cheeses such as cream and stilton cheeses derive their excellence from the quantity as well as the quality of the cream that enters into their composition caroline i had no idea that milk was such an interesting compound in many respects there appears to me to be a very striking analogy between milk and the contents of an egg both in respect to their nature and their use they are each of them composed of the various substances necessary for the nourishment of the young animal and equally destined for that purpose mrs b there is however a very essential difference the young animal is formed as well as nourished by the contents of the eggshell whilst milk serves as nutriment to the suckling only after it is born there are several peculiar animal substances which do not enter into the general enumeration of animal compounds and which however deserve to be mentioned spermaceti is of this class it is a kind of oily substance obtained from the head of the whale which however must undergo a certain preparation before it is in a fit state to be made into candles it is not much more combustible than tallow but it is pleasanter to burn as it is less fusible and less greasy ambergris is another peculiar substance derived from a species of whale it is however seldom obtained from the animal itself but is generally found floating on the surface of the sea wax you know is a concrete oil the peculiar product of the bee part of the constituents of which may probably be derived from flowers but so prepared by the organs of the bee and so mixed with its own substance as to be decidedly an animal product bees wax is naturally of a yellow colour but it is bleached by long exposure to the atmosphere or may be instantaneously whitened by the oxymuriatic acid the combustion of wax is far more perfect than that of tallow and consequently produces a greater quantity of light and heat lac is a substance very similar to wax in the manner of its formation it is the product of an insect which collects its ingredients from flowers apparently for the purpose of protecting its eggs from injury it is formed into cells fabricated with as much skill as those of the honeycomb but differently arranged the principal use of lac is in the manufacture of sealingwax and in making varnishes and lacquers musk civet and castor are other particular productions from different species of quadrupeds the two first are very powerful perfumes the latter has a nauseous smell and taste and is only used medicinally caroline is it from this substance that castor oil is obtained mrs b no far from it for castor oil is a vegetable oil expressed from the seeds of a particular plant and has not the least resemblance to the medicinal substance obtained from the castor silk is a peculiar secretion of the silkworm with which it builds its nest or cocoon this insect was originally brought to europe from china silk in its chemical nature is very similar to the hair and wool of animals whilst in the insect it is a fluid which is coagulated apparently by uniting with oxygen as soon as it comes in contact with the air the moth of the silkworm ejects a liquor which appears to contain a particular acid called bombic the properties of which are but very little known emily before we conclude the subject of the animal economy shall we not learn by what steps dead animals return to their elementary state mrs b animal matter although the most complicated of all natural substances returns to its elementary state by one single spontaneous process the putrid fermentation by this the albumen fibrine c are slowly reduced to the state of oxygen hydrogen nitrogen and carbon and thus the circle of changes through which these principles have passed is finally completed they first quitted their elementary form or their combination with unorganised matter to enter into the vegetable system hence they were transmitted to the animal kingdom and from this they return again to their primitive simplicity soon to reenter the sphere of organised existence when all the circumstances necessary to produce fermentation do not take place animal like vegetable matter is liable to a partial or imperfect decomposition which converts it into a combustible substance very like spermaceti i dare say that caroline who is so fond of analogies will consider this as a kind of animal bitumen caroline and why should i not since the processes which produce these substances are so similar mrs b there is however one considerable difference the state of bitumen seems permanent whilst that of animal substances thus imperfectly decomposed is only transient and unless precautions be taken to preserve them in that state a total dissolution infallibly ensues this circumstance of the occasional conversion of animal matter into a kind of spermaceti is of late discovery a manufacture has in consequence been established near bristol in which by exposing the carcases of horses and other animals for a length of time under water the muscular parts are converted into this spermacetilike substance the bones afterwards undergo a different process to produce hartshorn or more properly ammonia and phosphorus and the skin is prepared for leather thus art contrives to enlarge the sphere of useful purposes for which the elements were intended by nature and the productions of the several kingdoms are frequently arrested in their course and variously modified by human skill which compels them to contribute under new forms to the necessities or luxuries of man but all that we enjoy whether produced by the spontaneous operations of nature or the ingenious efforts of art proceed alike from the goodness of providence to god alone man owes the admirable faculties which enable him to improve and modify the productions of nature no less than those productions themselves in contemplating the works of the creation or studying the inventions of art let us therefore never forget the divine source from which they proceed and thus every acquisition of knowledge will prove a lesson of piety and virtue index a absorbent vessels ii 304 absorption of caloric i 59 66 acetic

concepts relating to living thingsphotosynthesis microorganisms the cell proteinsare either unknown or not mentioned the atom theory had been proposed but not by humphry davy it is not mentioned in this book the word explode is used at least once in its orginal figurative sense a word that should be exploded in chemistry but far more often in its later concrete one the word explosion is always used concretely an explosion or a detonation as chemists commonly call it calculated values the point of zero or the absolute privation of heat must consequently be 1260 degrees below 32 degrees 1228 f the calculation is based on wrong premises the correct figure is about 460 f or 273 c mercury congeals only at seventytwo degrees below the freezing point 40 f which is also 40 c this figure is correct though approximate the proportion stated by sir h davy in his chemical researches is as 1 to 2389 ammonia consisted of about one part of hydrogen to four parts of nitrogen and from the latest and most accurate experiments the proportions appear to be one volume of nitrogen gas to three of hydrogen gas these and similar calculations involving weight and volume make more sense when one knows the elements atomic weights for nitric acid hno3 the figures are 11448 giving a proportion closer to 135 for ammonia nh3 not 4 the figures are 143 the oxalic acid distilled from sorrel is the highest

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about project gutenberg including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new
