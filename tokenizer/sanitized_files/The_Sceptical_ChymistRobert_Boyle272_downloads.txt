part the sixth part the conclusion printers note errata a prface introductory to the following treatise to give the reader an account why the following treatise is sufferd to pass abroad so maimd and imperfect i must inform him that tis now long since that to gratify an ingenious gentleman i set down some of the reasons that kept me from fully acquiescing either in the peripatetical or in the chymical doctrine of the material principles of mixt bodies this discourse some years after falling into the hands of some learned men had the good luck to be so favourably receivd and advantageously spoken of by them that having had more then ordinary invitations given me to make it publick i thought fit to review it that i might retrench some things that seemd not so fit to be shewn to every reader and substitute some of those other things that occurrd to me of the trials and observations i had since made what became of my papers i elsewhere mention in a preface where i complain of it but since i writ that i found many sheets that belongd to the subjects i am now about to discourse of wherefore seeing that i had then in my hands as much of the first dialogue as was requisite to state the case and serve for an introduction as well to the conference betwixt carneades and eleutherius as to some other dialogues which for certain reasons are not now herewith publishd i resolvd to supply as well as i could the contents of a paper belonging to the second of the following discourses which i could not possibly retrive though it were the chief of them all and having once more tryd the opinion of friends but not of the same about this imperfect work i found it such that i was content in complyance with their desires that not only it should be publishd but that it should be publishd as soon as conveniently might be i had indeed all along the dialogues spoken of my self as of a third person for they containing discourses which were among the first treatises that i venturd long ago to write of matters philosophical i had reason to desire with the painter to latere pone tabulam and hear what men would say of them before i ownd my self to be their author but besides that now i find tis not unknown to many who it is that writ them i am made to believe that tis not inexpedient they should be known to come from a person not altogether a stranger to chymical affairs and i made the lesse scruple to let them come abroad uncompleated partly because my affairs and pringagements to publish divers other treatises allowd me small hopes of being able in a great while to compleat these dialogues and partly because i am not unapt to think that they may come abroad seasonably enough though not for the authors reputation yet for other purposes for i observe that of late chymistry begins as indeed it deserves to be cultivated by learned men who before despisd it and to be pretended to by many who never cultivated it that they may be thought not to ignore it whence it is come to passe that divers chymical notions about matters philosophical are taken for granted and employd and so adopted by very eminent writers both naturalists and physitians now this i fear may prove somewhat prejudicial to the advancement of solid philosophy for though i am a great lover of chymical experiments and though i have no mean esteem of divers chymical remedies yet i distinguish these from their notions about the causes of things and their manner of generation and for ought i can hitherto discern there are a thousand phnomena in nature besides a multitude of accidents relating to the humane body which will scarcely be clearly satisfactorily made out by them that confine themselves to deduce things from salt sulphur and mercury and the other notions peculiar to the chymists without taking much more notice than they are wont to do of the motions and figures of the small parts of matter and the other more catholick and fruitful affections of bodies wherefore it will not perhaps be now unseasonable to let our carneades warne men not to subscribe to the grand doctrine of the chymists touching their three hypostatical principles till they have a little examind it and considerd how they can clear it from his objections divers of which tis like they may never have thought on since a chymist scarce would and none but a chymist could propose them i hope also it will not be unacceptable to several ingenious persons who are unwilling to determine of any important controversie without a previous consideration of what may be said on both sides and yet have greater desires to understand chymical matters than opportunities of learning them to find here together besides several experiments of my own purposely made to illustrate the doctrine of the elements divers others scarce to be met with otherwise then scatterd among many chymical books and to find these associated experiments so deliverd as that an ordinary reader if he be but acquainted with the usuall chymical termes may easily enough understand them and even a wary one may safely rely on them these things i add because a person any thing versd in the writings of chymists cannot but discern by their obscure ambiguous and almost nigmatical way of expressing what they pretend to teach that they have no mind to be understood at all but by the sons of art as they call them nor to be understood even by these without difficulty and hazardous tryalls insomuch that some of them scarce ever speak so candidly as when they make use of that known chymical sentence ubi palam locuti fumus ibi nihil diximus and as the obscurity of what some writers deliver makes it very difficult to be understood so the unfaithfulness of too many others makes it unfit to be relid on for though unwillingly yet i must for the truths sake and the readers warne him not to be forward to believe chymical experiments when they are set down only by way of prescriptions and not of relations that is unless he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular knowledge or upon the relation of some credible person avowing it upon his own experience for i am troubled i must complain that even eminent writers both physitians and philosophers whom i can easily name if it be requird have of late sufferd themselves to be so far imposd upon as to publish and build upon chymical experiments which questionless they never tryd for if they had they would as well as i have found them not to be true and indeed it were to be wishd that now that those begin to quote chymical experiments that are not themselves acquainted with chymical operations men would leave off that indefinite way of vouching the chymists say this or the chymists affirme that and would rather for each experiment they alledge name the author or authors upon whose credit they relate it for by this means they would secure themselves from the suspition of falshood to which the other practice exposes them and they would leave the reader to judge of what is fit for him to believe of what is deliverd whilst they employ not their own great names to countenance doubtfull relations and they will also do justice to the inventors or publishers of true experiments as well as upon the obtruders of false ones whereas by that general way of quoting the chymists the candid writer is defrauded of the particular praise and the impostor escapes the personal disgrace that is due to him the remaining part of this prface must be imployd in saying something for carneades and something for my self and first carneades hopes that he will be thought to have disputed civilly and modestly enough for one that was to play the antagonist and the sceptick and if he any where seem to sleight his adversaries tenents and arguments he is willing to have it lookd upon as what he was inducd to not so much by his opinion of them as the examples of themistius and philoponus and the custom of such kind of disputes next in case that some of his arguments shall not be thought of the most cogent sort that may be he hopes it will be considerd that it ought not to be expected that they should be so for his part being chiefly but to propose doubts and scruples he does enough if he shews that his adversaries arguments are not strongly concluding though his own be not so neither and if there should appear any disagreement betwixt the things he delivers in divers passages he hopes it will be considerd that it is not necessary that all the things a sceptick proposes should be consonant since it being his work to suggest doubts against the opinion he questions it is allowable for him to propose two or more severall hypotheses about the same thing and to say that it may be accounted for this way or that way or the other way though these wayes be perhaps inconsistent among themselves because it is enough for him if either of the proposed hypotheses be but as probable as that he calls a question and if he proposes many that are each of them probable he does the more satisfie his doubts by making it appear the more difficult to be sure that that which they alwayes differ from is the true and our carneades by holding the negative he has this advantage that if among all the instances he brings to invalidate all the vulgar doctrine of those he disputes with any one be irrefragable that alone is sufficient to overthrow a doctrine which universally asserts what he opposes for it cannot be true that all bodies whatsoever that are reckond among the perfectly mixt ones are compounded of such a determinate number of such or such ingredients in case any one such body can be producd that is not so compounded and he hopes too that accurateness will be the less expected from him because his undertaking obliges him to maintain such opinions in chymistry and that chiefly by chymical arguments as are contrary to the very principles of the chymists from whose writings it is not therefore like he should receive any intentionall assistance except from some passages of the bold and ingenious helmont with whom he yet disagrees in many things which reduce him to explicate divers chymical phnomena according to other notions and of whose ratiocinations not only some seem very extravagant but even the rest are not wont to be as considerable as his experiments and though it be true indeed that some aristotelians have occasionally written against the chymical doctrine he oppugnes yet since they have done it according to their principles and since our carneades must as well oppose their hypothesis as that of the spagyrist he was fain to fight his adversaries with their own weapons those of the peripatetick being improper if not hurtfull for a person of his tenents besides that those aristotelians at least those he met with that have written against the chymists seem to have had so little experimental knowledge in chymical matters that by their frequent mistakes and unskilfull way of oppugning they have too often exposd themselves to the derision of their adversaries for writing so confidently against what they appear so little to understand and lastly carneades hopes he shall doe the ingenious this piece of service that by having thus drawn the chymists doctrine out of their dark and smoakie laboratories and both brought it into the open light and shewn the weakness of their proofs that have hitherto been wont to be brought for it either judicious men shall henceforth be allowed calmly and after due information to disbelieve it or those abler chymists that are zealous for the reputation of it will be obligd to speak plainer then hitherto has been done and maintain it by better experiments and arguments then those carneades hath examind so that he hopes the curious will one way or other derive either satisfaction or instruction from his endeavours and as he is ready to make good the profession he makes in the close of his discourse he being ready to be better informd so he expects either to be indeed informd or to be let alone for though if any truly knowing chymists shall think fit in a civil and rational way to shew him any truth touching the matter in dispute that he yet discernes not carneades will not refuse either to admit or to own a conviction yet if any impertinent person shall either to get himself a name or for what other end soever wilfully or carelesly mistake the state of the controversie or the sence of his arguments or shall rail instead of arguing as hath been done of late in print by divers chymists1 or lastly shall write against them in a canting way i mean shall express himself in ambiguous or obscure termes or argue from experiments not intelligibly enough deliverd carneades professes that he values his time so much as not to think the answering such trifles worth the loss of it footnote 1 g and f and h and others in their books against one another and now having said thus much for carneades i hope the reader will give me leave to say something too for my self and first if some morose readers shall find fault with my having made the interlocutors upon occasion complement with one another and that i have almost all along written these dialogues in a stile more fashionable then that of meer scholars is wont to be i hope i shall be excusd by them that shall consider that to keep a due decorum in the discourses it was fit that in a book written by a gentleman and wherein only gentlemen are introducd as speakers the language should be more smooth and the expressions more civil than is usual in the more scholastick way of writing and indeed i am not sorry to have this opportunity of giving an example how to manage even disputes with civility whence perhaps some readers will be assisted to discern a difference betwixt bluntness of speech and strength of reason and find that a man may be a champion for truth without being an enemy to civility and may confute an opinion without railing at them that hold it to whom he that desires to convince and not to provoke them must make some amends by his civility to their persons for his severity to their mistakes and must say as little else as he can to displease them when he says that they are in an error but perhaps other readers will be less apt to find fault with the civility of my disputants than the chymists will be upon the reading of some passages of the following dialogue to accuse carneades of asperity but if i have made my sceptick sometimes speak sleightingly of the opinions he opposes i hope it will not be found that i have done any more than became the part he was to act of an opponent especially if what i have made him say be compard with what the prince of the romane orators himself makes both great persons and friends say of one anothers opinions in his excellent dialogues de natura deorum and i shall scarce be suspected of partiality in the case by them that take notice that there is full as much if not far more liberty of sleighting their adversaries tenents to be met with in the discourses of those with whom carneades disputes nor needed i make the interlocutors speak otherwise then freely in a dialogue wherein it was sufficiently intimated that i meant not to declare my own opinion of the arguments proposd much lesse of the whole controversy it self otherwise than as it may by an attentive reader be guessd at by some passages of carneades i say some passages because i make not all that he says especially in the heat of disputation mine partly in this discourse and partly in some other dialogues betwixt the same speakers though they treat not immediately of the elements which have long layn by me and expect the entertainment that these present discourses will meet with and indeed they will much mistake me that shall conclude from what i now publish that i am at defyance with chymistry or would make my readers so i hope the specimina i have lately publishd of an attempt to shew the usefulness of chymical experiments to contemplative philosophers will give those that shall read them other thoughts of me i had a design but wanted opportunity to publish with these papers an essay i have lying by me the greater part of which is apologetical for one sort of chymists and at least as for those that know me i hope the pain i have taken in the fire will both convince them that i am far from being an enemy to the chymists art though i am no friend to many that disgrace it by professing it and perswade them to believe me when i declare that i distinguish betwixt those chymists that are either cheats or but laborants and the true adepti by whom could i enjoy their conversation i would both willingly and thankfully be instructed especially concerning the nature and generation of metals and possibly those that know how little i have remitted of my former addictedness to make chymical experiments will easily believe that one of the chief designes of this sceptical discourse was not so much to discredit chymistry as to give an occasion and a kind of necessity to the more knowing artists to lay aside a little of their overgreat reservedness either explicate or prove the chymical theory better than ordinary chymists have done or by enriching us with some of their nobler secrets to evince that their art is able to make amends even for the deficiencies of their theory and thus much i shall here make bold to add that we shall much undervalue chymistry if we imagine that it cannot teach us things farr more useful not only to physick but to philosophy than those that are hitherto known to vulgar chymists and yet as for inferiour spagyrists themselves they have by their labours deservd so well of the commonwealth of learning that methinks tis pity they should ever misse the truth which they have so industriously sought and though i be no admirer of the theorical part of their art yet my conjectures will much deceive me if the practical part be not much more cultivated than hitherto it has been and do not both employ philosophy and philosophers and help to make men such nor would i that have been diverted by other studies as well as affairs be thought to pretend being a profound spagyrist by finding so many faults in the doctrine wherein the generality of chymists scruples not to acquiesce for besides that tis most commonly far easier to frame objections against any proposd hypothesis than to propose an hypothesis not lyable to objections besides this i say tis no such great matter if whereas beginners in chymistry are commonly at once imbud with the theory and operations of their profession i who had the good fortune to learn the operations from illiterate persons upon whose credit i was not tempted to take up any opinion about them should consider things with lesse prejudice and consequently with other eyes than the generality of learners and should be more disposd to accommodate the phnomena that occurd to me to other notions than to those of the spagyrists and having at first entertaind a suspition that the vulgar principles were lesse general and comprehensive or lesse considerately deducd from chymical operations than was believd it was not uneasie for me both to take notice of divers phnomena overlookd by prepossest persons that seemd not to suite so well with the hermetical doctrine and to devise some experiments likely to furnish me with objections against it not known to many that having practisd chymistry longer perchance then i have yet livd may have far more experience than i of particular processes to conclude whether the notions i have proposd and the experiments i have communicated be considerable or not i willingly leave others to judge and this only i shall say for my self that i have endeavourd to deliver matters of fact so faithfully that i may as well assist the lesse skilful readers to examine the chymical hypothesis as provoke the spagyrical philosophers to illustrate it which if they do and that either the chymical opinion or the peripatetick or any other theory of the elements differing from that i am most inclind to shall be intelligibly explicated and duly provd to me what i have hitherto discoursd will not hinder it from making a proselyte of a person that loves fluctuation of judgment little enough to be willing to be easd of it by any thing but error physiological considerations touching the experiments wont to be employed to evince either the iv peripatetick elements or the iii chymical principles of mixt bodies part of the first dialogue i perceive that divers of my friends have thought it very strange to hear me speak so irresolvedly as i have been wont to do concerning those things which some take to be the elements and others to be the principles of all mixt bodies but i blush not to acknowledge that i much lesse scruple to confess that i doubt when i do so then to profess that i know what i do not and i should have much stronger expectations then i dare yet entertain to see philosophy solidly establisht if men would more carefully distinguish those things that they know from those that they ignore or do but think and then explicate clearly the things they conceive they understand acknowledge ingenuously what it is they ignore and profess so candidly their doubts that the industry of intelligent persons might be set on work to make further enquiries and the easiness of less discerning men might not be imposd on but because a more particular accompt will probably be expected of my unsatisfyedness not only with the peripatetick but with the chymical doctrine of the primitive ingredients of bodies it may possibly serve to satisfy others of the excusableness of my disatisfaction to peruse the ensuing relation of what passed a while since at a meeting of persons of several opinions in a place that need not here be named where the subject whereof we have been speaking was amply and variously discoursd of it was on one of the fairest dayes of this summer that the inquisitive eleutherius came to invite me to make a visit with him to his friend carneades i readily consented to this motion telling him that if he would but permit me to go first and make an excuse at a place not far off where i had at that hour appointed to meet but not about a business either of moment or that could not well admit of a delay i would presently wait on him because of my knowing carneades to be so conversant with nature and with furnaces and so unconfind to vulgar opinions that he would probably by some ingenious paradox or other give our mindes at least a pleasing exercise and perhaps enrich them with some solid instruction eleutherius then first going with me to the place where my apology was to be made i accompanied him to the lodging of carneades where when we were come we were told by the servants that he was retired with a couple of friends whose names they also told us to one of the arbours in his garden to enjoy under its coole shades a delightful protection from the yet troublesome heat of the sun eleutherius being perfectly acquainted with that garden immediately led me to the arbour and relying on the intimate familiarity that had been long cherishd betwixt him and carneades in spight of my reluctancy to what might look like an intrusion upon his privacy drawing me by the hand he abruptly entered the arbour where we found carneades philoponus and themistius sitting close about a little round table on which besides paper pen and inke there lay two or three open books carneades appeared not at all troubled at this surprise but rising from the table received his friend with open looks and armes and welcoming me also with his wonted freedom and civility invited us to rest our selves by him which as soon as we had exchanged with his two friends who were ours also the civilities accustomed on such occasions we did and he presently after we had seated our selves shutting the books that lay open and turning to us with a smiling countenance seemed ready to begin some such unconcerning discourse as is wont to pass or rather waste the time in promiscuous companies but eleutherius guessing at what he meant to do prevented him by telling him i perceive carneades by the books that you have been now shutting and much more by the posture wherein i found persons qualifid errata so qualifyd to discourse of serious matters and so accustomd to do it that you three were before our coming engagd in some philosophical conference which i hope you will either prosecute and allow us to be partakers of in recompence of the freedome we have usd in presuming to surprise you or else give us leave to repair the injury we should otherwise do you by leaving you to the freedom we have interrupted and punishing our selves for our boldness by depriving our selves of the happiness of your company with these last words he and i rose up as if we meant to be gone but carneades suddenly laying hold on his arme and stopping him by it smileingly told him we are not so forward to lose good company as you seem to imagine especially since you are pleasd to desire to be present at what we shall say about such a subject as that you found us considering for that being the number of the elements principles or materiall ingredients of bodies is an enquiry whose truth is of that importance and of that difficulty that it may as well deserve as require to be searched into by such skilfull indagators of nature as your selves and therefore we sent to invite the bold and acute leucippus to lend us some light by his atomical paradox upon which we expected such pregnant hints that twas not without a great deal of trouble that we had lately word brought us that he was not to be found and we had likewise beggd the assistance of your presence and thoughts had not the messenger we employd to leucippus informd us that as he was going he saw you both pass by towards another part of the town and this frustrated expectation of leucippus his company who told me but last night that he would be ready to give me a meeting where i pleasd to day having very long suspended our conference about the freshly mentiond subject it was so newly begun when you came in that we shall scarce need to repeat any thing to acquaint you with what has passd betwixt us before your arrival so that i cannot but look upon it as a fortunate accident that you should come so seasonably to be not hearers alone but we hope interlocutors at our conference for we shall not only allow of your presence at it but desire your assistance in it which i adde both for other reasons and because though these learned gentlemen sayes he turning to his two friends need not fear to discourse before any auditory provided it be intelligent enough to understand them yet for my part continues he with a new smile i shall not dare to vent my unpremeditated thoughts before two such criticks unless by promising to take your turnes of speaking you will allow me mine of quarrelling with what has been said he and his friends added divers things to convince us that they were both desirous that we should hear them and resolved against our doing so unless we allowed them sometimes to hear us elutherius transcribers note eleutherius after having a while fruitlesly endeavoured to obtain leave to be silent promisd he would not be so alwayes provided that he were permitted according to the freedom of his genious and principles to side with one of them in the managing of one argument and if he saw cause with his antagonist in the prosecution of another without being confind to stick to any one party or opinion which was after some debate accorded him but i conscious to my own disabilitys told them resolutely that i was as much more willing as more fit to be a hearer then a speaker among such knowing persons and on so abstruse a subject and that therefore i beseeched them without necessitating me to proclaim my weaknesses to allow me to lessen them by being a silent auditor of their discourses to suffer me to be at which i could present them no motive save that their instructions would make them in me a more intelligent admirer i added that i desird not to be idle whilst they were imployd but would if they pleasd by writing down in short hand what should be delivered preserve discourses that i knew would merit to be lasting at first carneades and his two friends utterly rejected this motion and all that my resoluteness to make use of my ears not tongue at their debates could do was to make them acquiesce in the proposition of eleutherius who thinking himself concernd because he brought me thither to afford me some faint assistance was content that i should register their arguments that i might be the better able after the conclusion of their conference to give them my sence upon the subject of it the number of elements or principles which he promisd i should do at the end of the present debates if time would permit or else at our next meeting and this being by him undertaken in my name though without my consent the company would by no means receive my protestation against it but casting all at once their eyes on carneades they did by that and their unanimous silence invite him to begin which after a short pause during which he turnd himself to eleutherius and me he did in this manner notwithstanding the subtile reasonings i have met with in the books of the peripateticks and the pretty experiments that have been shewd me in the laboratories of chymists i am of so diffident or dull a nature as to think that if neither of them can bring more cogent arguments to evince the truth of their assertion then are wont to be brought a man may rationally enough retain some doubts concerning the very number of those materiall ingredients of mixt bodies which some would have us call elements and others principles indeed when i considered that the tenents concerning the elements are as considerable amongst the doctrines of natural philosophy as the elements themselves are among the bodies of the universe i expected to find those opinions solidly establishd upon which so many others are superstructed but when i took the pains impartially to examine the bodies themselves that are said to result from the blended elements and to torture them into a confession of their constituent principles i was quickly inducd to think that the number of the elements has been contended about by philosophers with more earnestness then success this unsatisfiedness of mine has been much wonderd at by these two gentlemen at which words he pointed at themistius and philoponus who though they differ almost as much betwixt themselves about the question we are to consider as i do from either of them yet they both agree very well in this that there is a determinate number of such ingredients as i was just now speaking of and that what that number is i say not may be for what may not such as they perswade but is wont to be clearly enough demonstrated both by reason and experience this has occasiond our present conference for our discourse this afternoon having fallen from one subject to another and at length setld on this they profferd to demonstrate to me each of them the truth of his opinion out of both the topicks that i have freshly namd but on the former that of reason strictly so taken we declind insisting at the present lest we should not have time enough before supper to go thorough the reasons and experiments too the latter of which we unanimously thought the most requisite to be seriously examind i must desire you then to take notice gentlemen continued carneades that my present business doth not oblige me so to declare my own opinion on the subject in question as to assert or deny the truth either of the peripatetick or the chymical doctrine concerning the number of the elements but only to shew you that neither of these doctrines hath been satisfactorily proved by the arguments commonly alledged on its behalfe so that if i really discern as perhaps i think i do that there may be a more rational account then ordinary given of one of these opinions i am left free to declare my self of it notwithstanding my present engagement it being obvious to all your observation that a solid truth may be generally maintained by no other then incompetent arguments and to this declaration i hope it will be needless to add that my task obliges me not to answer the arguments that may be drawn either for themistius or philoponuss opinion from the topick of reason as opposed to experiments since tis these only that i am to examine and not all these neither but such of them alone as either of them shall think fit to insist on and as have hitherto been wont to be brought either to prove that tis the four peripatetick elements or that tis the three chymical principles that all compounded bodies consist of these things adds carneades i thought my self obliged to premise partly lest you should do these gentlemen pointing at themistius and philoponus and smiling on them the injury of measuring their parts by the arguments they are ready to propose the lawes of our conference confining them to make use of those that the vulgar of philosophers for even of them there is a vulgar has drawn up to their hands and partly that you should not condemn me of presumption for disputing against persons over whom i can hope for no advantage that i must not derive from the nature or rules of our controversy wherein i have but a negative to defend and wherein too i am like on several occasions to have the assistance of one of my disagreeing adversaries against the other philoponus and themistius soon returned this complement with civilities of the like nature in which eleutherius perceiving them engaged to prevent the further loss of that time of which they were not like to have very much to spare he minded them that their present businesse was not to exchange complements but arguments and then addressing his speech to carneades i esteem it no small happinesse saies he that i am come here so luckily this evening for i have been long disquieted with doubts concerning this very subject which you are now ready to debate and since a question of this importance is to be now discussed by persons that maintain such variety of opinions concerning it and are both so able to enquire after truth and so ready to embrace it by whomsoever and on what occasion soever it is presented them i cannot but promise my self that i shall before we part either lose my doubts or the hopes of ever finding them resolved eleutherius paused not here but to prevent their answer added almost in the same breath and i am not a little pleased to find that you are resolved on this occasion to insist rather on experiments then syllogismes for i and no doubt you have long observed that those dialectical subtleties that the schoolmen too often employ about physiological mysteries are wont much more to declare the wit of him that uses them then increase the knowledge or remove the doubts of sober lovers of truth and such captious subtleties do indeed often puzzle and sometimes silence men but rarely satisfy them being like the tricks of jugglers whereby men doubt not but they are cheated though oftentimes they cannot declare by what slights they are imposed on and therefore i think you have done very wisely to make it your businesse to consider the phnomena relating to the present question which have been afforded by experiments especially since it might seem injurious to our senses by whose mediation we acquire so much of the knowledge we have of things corporal to have recourse to farfetched and abstracted ratiocination errata ratiocinations to know what are the sensible ingredients of those sensible things that we daily see and handle and are supposed to have the liberty to untwist if i may so speak into the primitive bodies they consist of he annexed that he wished therefore they would no longer delay his expected satisfaction if they had not as he feared they had forgotten something preparatory to their debate and that was to lay down what should be all along understood by the word principle or element carneades thankd him for his admonition but told him that they had not been unmindful of so requisite a thing but that being gentlemen and very far from the litigious humour of loving to wrangle about words or terms or notions as empty they had before his coming in readily agreed promiscuously to use when they pleased elements and principles as terms equivalent and to understand both by the one and the other those primitive and simple bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed and into which they are ultimately resolved and upon the same account he added we agreed to discourse of the opinions to be debated as we have found them maintained by the generality of the assertors of the four elements of the one party and of those that receive the three principles on the other without tying our selves to enquire scrupulously what notion either aristotle or paracelsus or this or that interpreter or follower of either of those great persons framed of elements or principles our design being to examine not what these or those writers thought or taught but what we find to be the obvious and most general opinion of those who are willing to be accounted favourers of the peripatetick or chymical doctrine concerning this subject i see not saies eleutherius why you might not immediately begin to argue if you were but agreed which of your two friendly adversaries shall be first heard and it being quickly resolvd on that themistius should first propose the proofs for his opinion because it was the antienter and the more general he made not the company expect long before he thus addressed himself to eleutherius as to the person least interessed in the dispute if you have taken sufficient notice of the late confession which was made by carneades and which though his civility dressed it up in complementall expressions was exacted of him by his justice i suppose you will be easily made sensible that i engage in this controversie with great and peculiar disadvantages besides those which his parts and my personal disabilities would bring to any other cause to be maintained by me against him for he justly apprehending the force of truth though speaking by no better a tongue then mine has made it the chief condition of our duell that i should lay aside the best weapons i have and those i can best handle whereas if i were allowed the freedom in pleading for the four elements to employ the arguments suggested to me by reason to demonstrate them i should almost as little doubt of making you a proselyte to those unseverd teachers truth and aristotle as i do of your candour and your judgment and i hope you will however consider that that great favorite and interpreter of nature aristotle who was as his organum witnesses the greatest master of logick that ever livd disclaimd the course taken by other petty philosophers antient and modern who not attending the coherence and consequences of their opinions are more sollicitous to make each particular opinion plausible independently upon the the transcribers note extra the in original rest then to frame them all so as not only to be consistent together but to support each other for that great man in his vast and comprehensive intellect so framd each of his notions that being curiously adapted into one systeme they need not each of them any other defence then that which their mutuall coherence gives them as tis in an arch where each single stone which if severd from the rest would be perhaps defenceless is sufficiently securd by the solidity and entireness of the whole fabrick of which it is a part how justly this may be applyd to the present case i could easily shew you if i were permitted to declare to you how harmonious aristotles doctrine of the elements is with his other principles of philosophy and how rationally he has deducd their number from that of the combinations of the four first qualities from the kinds of simple motion belonging to simple bodies and from i know not how many other principles and phnomena of nature which so conspire with his doctrine of the elements that they mutually strengthen and support each other but since tis forbidden me to insist on reflections of this kind i must proceed to tell you that though the assertors of the four elements value reason so highly and are furnishd with arguments enough drawn from thence to be satisfid that there must be four elements though no man had ever yet made any sensible tryal to discover their number yet they are not destitute of experience to satisfie others that are wont to be more swayd by their senses then their reason and i shall proceed to consider the testimony of experience when i shall have first advertisd you that if men were as perfectly rational as tis to be wishd they were this sensible way of probation would be as needless as tis wont to be imperfect for it is much more high and philosophical to discover things a priore then a posteriore and therefore the peripateticks have not been very sollicitous to gather experiments to prove their doctrines contenting themselves with a few only to satisfie those that are not capable of a nobler conviction and indeed they employ experiments rather to illustrate then to demonstrate their doctrines as astronomers use sphres of pastboard to descend to the capacities of such as must be taught by their senses for want of being arrivd to a clear apprehension of purely mathematical notions and truths i speak thus eleutherius adds themistius only to do right to reason and not out of diffidence of the experimental proof i am to alledge for though i shall name but one yet it is such a one as will make all other appear as needless as it self will be found satisfactory for if you but consider a piece of greenwood burning in a chimney you will readily discern in the disbanded parts of it the four elements of which we teach it and other mixt bodies to be composd the fire discovers it self in the flame by its own light the smoke by ascending to the top of the chimney and there readily vanishing into air like a river losing it self in the sea sufficiently manifests to what element it belongs and gladly returnes the water in its own form boyling and hissing at the ends of the burning wood betrayes it self to more then one of our senses and the ashes by their weight their firiness and their dryness put it past doubt that they belong to the element of earth if i spoke continues themistius to less knowing persons i would perhaps make some excuse for building upon such an obvious and easie analysis but twould be i fear injurious not to think such an apology needless to you who are too judicious either to think it necessary that experiments to prove obvious truths should be farr fetchd or to wonder that among so many mixt bodies that are compounded of the four elements some of them should upon a slight analysis manifestly exhibite the ingredients they consist of especially since it is very agreeable to the goodness of nature to disclose even in some of the most obvious experiments that men make a truth so important and so requisite to be taken notice of by them besides that our analysis by how much the more obvious we make it by so much the more suittable it will be to the nature of that doctrine which tis alledged to prove which being as clear and intelligible to the understanding as obvious to the sense tis no marvail the learned part of mankind should so long and so generally imbrace it for this doctrine is very different from the whimseys of chymists and other modern innovators of whose hypotheses we may observe as naturalists do of less perfect animals that as they are hastily formd so they are commonly short livd for so these as they are often framd in one week are perhaps thought fit to be laughed at the next and being built perchance but upon two or three experiments are destroyed by a third or fourth whereas the doctrine of the four elements was framd by aristotle after he had leasurely considered those theories of former philosophers which are now with great applause revived as discovered by these latter ages and had so judiciously detected and supplyed the errors and defects of former hypotheses concerning the elements that his doctrine of them has been ever since deservedly embraced by the letterd part of mankind all the philosophers that preceded him having in their several ages contributed to the compleatness of this doctrine as those of succeeding times have acquiescd in it nor has an hypothesis so deliberately and maturely established been called in question till in the last century paracelsus and some few other sooty empiricks rather then as they are fain to call themselves philosophers having their eyes darkend and their brains troubld with the smoke of their own furnaces began to rail at the peripatetick doctrine which they were too illiterate to understand and to tell the credulous world that they could see but three ingredients in mixt bodies which to gain themselves the repute of inventors they endeavoured to disguise by calling them instead of earth and fire and vapour salt sulphur and mercury to which they gave the canting title of hypostatical principles but when they came to describe them they shewed how little they understood what they meant by them by disagreeing as much from one another as from the truth they agreed in opposing for they deliver their hypotheses as darkly as their processes and tis almost as impossible for any sober man to find their meaning as tis for them to find their elixir and indeed nothing has spread their philosophy but their great brags and undertakings notwithstanding all which sayes themistius smiling i scarce know any thing they have performed worth wondering at save that they have been able to draw philoponus to their party and to engage him to the defence of an unintelligible hypothesis who knowes so well as he does that principles ought to be like diamonds as well very clear as perfectly solid themistius having after these last words declared by his silence that he had finished his discourse carneades addressing himself as his adversary had done to eleutherius returned this answer to it i hopd for errata for a demonstration but i perceive themistius hopes to put me off with a harangue wherein he cannot have given me a greater opinion of his parts then he has given me distrust for his hypothesis since for it even a man of such learning can bring no better arguments the rhetorical part of his discourse though it make not the least part of it i shall say nothing to designing to examine only the argumentative part and leaving it to philoponus to answer those passages wherein either paracelsus or chymists are concernd i shall observe to you that in what he has said besides he makes it his business to do these two things the one to propose and make out an experiment to demonstrate the common opinion about the four elements and the other to insinuate divers things which he thinks may repair the weakness of his argument from experience and upon other accounts bring some credit to the otherwise defenceless doctrine he maintains to begin then with his experiment of the burning wood it seems to me to be obnoxious to not a few considerable exceptions and first if i would now deal rigidly with my adversary i might here make a great question of the very way of probation which he and others employ without the least scruple to evince that the bodies commonly calld mixt are made up of earth air water and fire which they are pleasd also to call elements namely that upon the supposd analysis made by the fire of the former sort of concretes there are wont to emerge bodies resembling those which they take for the elements for not to anticipate here what i foresee i shall have occasion to insist on when i come to discourse with philoponus concerning the right that fire has to pass for the proper and universal instrument of analysing mixt bodies not to anticipate that i say if i were disposd to wrangle i might alledge that by themistius his experiment it would appear rather that those he calls elements are made of those he calls mixt bodies then mixd bodies of the elements for in themistiuss analyzd wood and in other bodies dissipated and alterd by the fire it appears and he confesses that which he takes for elementary fire and water are made out of the concrete but it appears not that the concrete was made up of fire and water nor has either he or any man for ought i know of his perswasion yet provd that nothing can be obtained from a body by the fire that was not preexistent in it at this unexpected objection not only themistius but the rest of the company appeard not a little surprizd but after a while philoponus conceiving his opinion as well as that of aristotle concernd in that objection you cannot sure sayes he to carneades propose this difficulty not to call it cavill otherwise then as an exercise of wit and not as laying any weight upon it for how can that be separated from a thing that was not existent in it when for instance a refiner mingles gold and lead and exposing this mixture upon a cuppell to the violence of the fire thereby separates it into pure and refulgent gold and lead which driven off together with the dross of the gold is thence calld lithargyrium auri can any man doubt that sees these two so differing substances separated from the mass that they were existent in it before it was committed to the fire i should replies carneades allow your argument to prove something if as men see the refiners commonly take before hand both lead and gold to make the mass you speak of so we did see nature pull down a parcell of the element of fire that is fancyd to be placd i know not how many thousand leagues off contiguous to the orb of the moon and to blend it with a quantity of each of the three other elements to compose every mixt body upon whose resolution the fire presents us with fire and earth and the rest and let me add philoponus that to make your reasoning cogent it must be first provd that the fire dos only take the elementary ingredients asunder without otherwise altering them for else tis obvious that bodies may afford substances which were not preexistent in them as flesh too long kept produces magots and old cheese mites which i suppose you will not affirm to be ingredients of those bodies now that fire dos not alwayes barely separate the elementary parts but sometimes at least alter also the ingredients of bodies if i did not expect ere long a better occasion to prove it i might make probable out of your very instance wherein there is nothing elementary separated by the great violence of the refiners fire the gold and lead which are the two ingredients separated upon the analysis being confessedly yet perfectly mixt bodies and the litharge being lead indeed but such lead as is differing in consistence and other qualities from what it was before to which i must add that i have sometimes seen and so questionlesse have you much oftener some parcells of glasse adhering to the test or cuppel and this glass though emergent as well as the gold or litharge upon your analysis you will not i hope allow to have been a third ingredient of the mass out of which the fire producd it both philoponus and themistius were about to reply when eleutherius apprehending that the prosecution of this dispute would take up time which might be better employd thought fit to prevent them by saying to carneades you made at least half a promise when you first proposd this objection that you would not now at least insist on it nor indeed does it seem to be of absolute necessity to your cause that you should for though you should grant that there are elements it would not follow that there must be precisely four and therefore i hope you will proceed to acquaint us with your other and more considerable objections against themistiuss opinion especially since there is so great a disproportion in bulke betwixt the earth water and air on the one part and those little parcells of resembling substances that the fire separates from concretes on the other part that i can scarce think that you are serious when to lose no advantage against your adversary you seem to deny it to be rational to conclude these great simple bodies to be the elements and not the products of compounded ones what you alledge replies carneades of the vastness of the earth and water has long since made me willing to allow them to be the greatest and chief masses of matter to be met with here below but i think i could shew you if you would give me leave that this will prove only that the elements as you call them are the chief bodies that make up the neighbouring part of the world but not that they are such ingredients as every mixt body must consist of but since you challenge me of something of a promise though it be not an entire one yet i shall willingly perform it and indeed i intended not when i first mentiond this objection to insist on it at present against themistius as i plainly intimated in my way of proposing it being only desirous to let you see that though i discernd my advantages yet i was willing to forego some of them rather then appear a rigid adversary of a cause so weak that it may with safety be favourably dealt with but i must here profess and desire you to take notice of it that though i pass on to another argument it is not because i think this first invalid for you will find in the progress of our dispute that i had some reason to question the very way of probation imployd both by peripateticks and chymists to evince the being and number of the elements for that there are such and that they are wont to be separated by the analysis made by fire is indeed taken for granted by both parties but has not for ought i know been so much as plausibly attempted to be proved by either hoping then that when we come to that part of our debate wherein considerations relating to this matter are to be treated of you will remember what i have now said and that i do rather for a while suppose then absolutely grant the truth of what i have questiond i will proceed to another objection and hereupon eleutherius having promisd him not to be unmindfull when time should serve of what he had declard i consider then sayes carneades in the next place that there are divers bodies out of which themistius will not prove in haste that there can be so many elements as four extracted by the fire and i should perchance trouble him if i should ask him what peripatetick can shew us i say not all the four elements for that would be too rigid a question but any one of them extracted out of gold by any degree of fire whatsoever nor is gold the only bodie in nature that would puzzle an aristotelian that is no more errata that is no more to analyze by the fire into elementary bodies since for ought i have yet observd both silver and calcind venetian talck and some other concretes not necessary here to be namd are so fixt that to reduce any of them into four heterogeneous substances has hitherto provd a task much too hard not only for the disciples of aristotle but those of vulcan at least whilst the latter have employd only fire to make the analysis the next argument continues carneades that i shall urge against themistiuss opinion shall be this that as there are divers bodies whose analysis by fire cannot reduce them into so many heterogeneous substances or ingregredients transcribers note ingredients as four so there are others which may be reducd into more as the blood and divers other parts of men and other animals which yield when analyzd five distinct substances phlegme spirit oyle salt and earth as experience has shewn us in distilling mans blood hartshorns and divers other bodies that belonging to the animalkingdom abound with not uneasily sequestrable salt the sceptical chymist or chymicophysical doubts paradoxes touching the experiments whereby vulgar spagyrists are wont to endeavour to evince their salt sulphur and mercury to be the true principles of things utinam jam tenerentur omnia inoperta ac confessa veritas esset nihil ex decretis mutaremus nunc veritatem cum eis qui docent qurimus sen london printed for j crooke and are to be sold at the ship in st pauls churchyard 1661 the sceptical chymist the first part i am sayes carneades so unwilling to deny eleutherius any thing that though before the rest of the company i am resolvd to make good the part i have undertaken of a sceptick yet i shall readily since you will have it so lay aside for a while the person of an adversary to the peripateticks and chymists and before i acquaint you with my objections against their opinions acknowledge to you what may be whether truly or not tollerably enough added in favour of a certain number of principles of mixt bodies to that grand and known argument from the analysis of compound bodies which i may possibly hereafter be able to confute and that you may the more easily examine and the better judge of what i have to say i shall cast it into a pretty number of distinct propositions to which i shall not premise any thing because i take it for granted that you need not be advertisd that much of what i am to deliver whether for or against a determinate number of ingredients of mixd bodies may be indifferently applyd to the four peripatetick elements and the three chymical principles though divers of my objections will more peculiarly belong to these last namd because the chymical hypothesis seeming to be much more countenancd by experience then the other it will be expedient to insist chiefly upon the disproving of that especially since most of the arguments that are imployd against it may by a little variation be made to conclude at least as strongly against the less plausible aristotelian doctrine to proceed then to my propositions i shall begin with this that sidenote propos i it seems not absurd to conceive that at the first production of mixt bodies the universal matter whereof they among other parts of the universe consisted was actually divided into little particles of several sizes and shapes variously movd this sayes carneades i suppose you will easily enough allow for besides that which happens in the generation corruption nutrition and wasting of bodies that which we discover partly by our microscopes of the extream littlenesse of even the scarce sensible parts of concretes and partly by the chymical resolutions of mixt bodies and by divers other operations of spagyrical fires upon them seems sufficiently to manifest their consisting of parts very minute and of differing figures and that there does also intervene a various local motion of such small bodies will scarce be denied whether we chuse to grant the origine of concretions assignd by epicurus or that related by moses for the first as you well know supposes not only all mixt bodies but all others to be producd by the various and casual occursions of atomes moving themselves to and fro by an internal principle in the immense or rather infinite vacuum and as for the inspird historian he informing us that the great and wise author of things did not immediately create plants beasts birds c but producd them out of those portions of the preexistent though created matter that he calls water and earth allows us to conceive that the constituent particles whereof these new concretes were to consist were variously moved in order to their being connected into the bodies they were by their various coalitions and textures to compose but continues carneades presuming that the first proposition needs not be longer insisted on i will pass on to the second and tell you that sidenote propos ii neither is it impossible that of these minute particles divers of the smallest and neighbouring ones were here and there associated into minute masses or clusters and did by their coalitions constitute great store of such little primary concretions or masses as were not easily dissipable into such particles as composd them to what may be deducd in favour of this assertion from the nature of the thing it self i will add something out of experience which though i have not known it used to such a purpose seems to me more fairly to make out that there may be elementary bodies then the more questionable experiments of peripateticks and chymists prove that there are such i consider then that gold will mix and be colliquated not only with silver copper tin and lead but with antimony regulus martis and many other minerals with which it will compose bodies very differing both from gold and the other ingredients of the resulting concretes and the same gold will also by common aqua regis and i speak it knowingly by divers other menstruums be reducd into a seeming liquor in so much that the corpuscles of gold will with those of the menstruum pass through cappaper and with them also coagulate into a crystalline salt and i have further tryd that with a small quantity of a certain saline substance i prepard i can easily enough sublime gold into the form of red crystalls of a considerable length and many other wayes may gold be disguisd and help to constitute bodies of very differing natures both from it and from one another and neverthelesse be afterward reducd to the selfsame numerical yellow fixt ponderous and malleable gold it was before its commixture nor is it only the fixedst of metals but the most fugitive that i may employ in favour of our proposition for quicksilver will with divers metals compose an amalgam with divers menstruums it seems to be turnd into a liquor with aqua fortis will be brought into either a red or white powder or precipitate with oyl of vitriol into a pale yellow one with sulphur it will compose a bloodred and volatile cinaber with some saline bodies it will ascend in form of a salt which will be dissoluble in water with regulus of antimony and silver i have seen it sublimd into a kinde of crystals with another mixture i reducd it into a malleable body into a hard and brittle substance by another and some there are who affirm that by proper additaments they can reduce quicksilver into oyl nay into glass to mention no more and yet out of all these exotick compounds we may recover the very same running mercury that was the main ingredient of them and was so disguisd in them now the reason proceeds carneades that i have represented these things concerning gold and quicksilver is that it may not appear absurd to conceive that such little primary masses or clusters as our proposition mentions may remain undissipated notwithstanding their entring into the composition of various concretions since the corpuscle of gold and mercury though they be not primary concretions of the most minute particles or matter but confessedly mixt bodies are able to concurre plentifully to the composition of several very differing bodies without losing their own nature or texture or having their cohsion violated by the divorce of their associated parts or ingredients give me leave to add sayes eleutherius on this occasion to what you now observd that as confidently as some chymists and other modern innovators in philosophy are wont to object against the peripateticks that from the mixture of their four elements there could arise but an inconsiderable variety of compound bodies yet if the aristotelians were but half as well versd in the works of nature as they are in the writings of their master the proposd objection would not so calmly triumph as for want of experiments they are fain to suffer it to do for if we assigne to the corpuscles whereof each element consists a peculiar size and shape it may easily enough be manifested that such differingly figurd corpuscles may be mingled in such various proportions and may be connected so many several wayes that an almost incredible number of variously qualified concretes may be composd of them especially since the corpuscles of one element may barely by being associated among themselves make up little masses of differing size and figure from their constituent parts and since also to the strict union of such minute bodies there seems oftentimes nothing requisite besides the bare contact of a great part of their surfaces and how great a variety of phnomena the same matter without the addition of any other and only several ways disposd or contexed is able to exhibit may partly appear by the multitude of differing engins which by the contrivances of skilful mechanitians and the dexterity of expert workmen may be made of iron alone but in our present case being allowd to deduce compound bodies from four very differently qualified sorts of matter he who shall but consider what you freshly took notice of concerning the new concretes resulting from the mixture of incorporated minerals will scarce doubt but that the four elements mannagd by natures skill may afford a multitude of differing compounds i am thus far of your minde sayes carneades that the aristotelians might with probability deduce a much greater number of compound bodies from the mixture of their four elements than according to their present hypothesis they can if instead of vainly attempting to deduce the variety and properties of all mixt bodies from the combinations and temperaments of the four elements as they are among them endowd with the four first qualities they had endeavoured to do it by the bulk and figure of the smallest parts of those supposed elements for from these more catholick and fruitfull accidents of the elementary matter may spring a great variety of textures upon whose account a multitude of compound bodies may very much differ from one another and what i now observe touching the four peripatetick elements may be also applyed mutatis mutandis as they speak to the chymical principles but to take notice of that by the by both the one and the other must i fear call in to their assistance something that is not elementary to excite or regulate the motion of the parts of the matter and dispose them after the manner requisite to the constitution of particular concretes for that otherwise they are like to give us but a very imperfect account of the origine of very many mixt bodies it would i think be no hard matter to perswade you if it would not spend time and were no digression to examine what they are wont to alledge of the origine of the textures and qualities of mixt bodies from a certain substantial form whose origination they leave more obscure than what it is assumd to explicate but to proceed to a new proposition sidenote propos iii i shall not peremptorily deny that from most of such mixt bodies as partake either of animal or vegetable nature there may by the help of the fire be actually obtaind a determinate number whether three four or five or fewer or more of substances worthy of differing denominations of the experiments that induce me to make this concession i am like to have occasion enough to mention several in the prosecution of my discourse and therefore that i may not hereafter be obligd to trouble you and my self with needless repetitions i shall now only desire you to take notice of such experiments when they shall be mentiond and in your thoughts referre them hither to these three concessions i have but this fourth to add that sidenote propos iv it may likewise be granted that those distinct substances which concretes generally either afford or are made up of may without very much inconvenience be calld the elements or principles of them when i said without very much inconvenience i had in my thoughts that sober admonition of galen cum de re constat de verbis non est litigandum and therefore also i scruple not to say elements or principles partly because the chymists are wont to call the ingredients of mixt bodies principles as the aristotelians name them elements i would here exclude neither and partly because it seems doubtfull whether the same ingredients may not be calld principles as not being compounded of any more primary bodies and elements in regard that all mixd bodies are compounded of them but i thought it requisite to limit my concession by premising the words very much to the word inconvenience because that though the inconvenience of calling the distinct substances mentiond in the proposition elements or principles be not very great yet that it is an impropriety of speech and consequently in a matter of this moment not to be altogether overlookd you will perhaps think as well as i by that time you shall have heard the following part of my discourse by which you will best discern what construction to put upon the former propositions and how far they may be lookd upon as things that i concede as true and how far as things i only represent as specious enough to be fit to be considerd and now eleutherius continues carneades i must resume the person of a sceptick and as such propose some part of what may be either dislikt or at least doubted of in the common hypothesis of the chymists which if i examine with a little the more freedom i hope i need not desire you a person to whom i have the happinesse of being so well known to look upon it as something more suitable to the employment whereto the company has for this meeting doomd me then either to my humour or my custom now though i might present you many things against the vulgar chymical opinion of the three principles and the experiments wont to be alledgd as demonstrations of it yet those i shall at present offer you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four capital considerations touching all which i shall only premise this in general that since it is not my present task so much to assert an hypothesis of my own as to give an account wherefore i suspect the truth of that of the chymists it ought not to be expected that all my objections should be of the most cogent sort since it is reason enough to doubt of a proposd opinion that there appears no cogent reason for it to come then to the objections themselves i consider in the first place that notwithstanding what common chymists have provd or taught it may reasonably enough be doubted how far and in what sence fire ought to be esteemd the genuine and universal instrument of analyzing mixt bodies this doubt you may remember was formerly mentiond but so transiently discoursd of that it will now be fit to insist upon it and manifest that it was not so inconsiderately proposd as our adversaries then imagind but before i enter any farther into this disquisition i cannot but here take notice that it were to be wishd our chymists had clearly informd us what kinde of division of bodies by fire must determine the number of the elements for it is nothing near so easy as many seem to think to determine distinctly the effects of heat as i could easily manifest if i had leasure to shew you how much the operations of fire may be diversifyd by circumstances but not wholly to pass by a matter of this importance i will first take notice to you that guajacum for instance burnt with an open fire in a chimney is sequestred into ashes and soot whereas the same wood distilld in a retort does yield far other heterogeneities to use the helmontian expression and is resolvd into oyl spirit vinager water and charcoal the last of which to be reducd into ashes requires the being farther calcind then it can be in a close vessel besides having kindled amber and held a clean silver spoon or some other concave and smooth vessel over the smoak of its flame i observd the soot into which that fume condensd to be very differing from any thing that i had observd to proceed from the steam of amber purposely for that is not usual distilled per se in close vessels thus having for tryals sake kindled camphire and catcht the smoak that copiously ascended out of the flame it condensd into a black and unctuous soot which would not have been guessd by the smell or other properties to have proceeded from camphire whereas having as i shall otherwhere more fully declare exposd a quantity of that fugitive concrete to a gentle heat in a close glassvessel it sublimd up without seeming to have lost any thing of its whiteness or its nature both which it retaind though afterwards i so encreased the fire as to bring it to fusion and besides camphire there are divers other bodies that i elsewhere name in which the heat in close vessels is not wont to make any separation of heterogeneities but only a comminution of parts those that rise first being homogeneal with the others though subdivided into smaller particles whence sublimations have been stiled the pestles of the chymists but not here to mention what i elsewhere take notice of concerning common brimstone once or twice sublimd that exposd to a moderate fire in sublimingpots it rises all into dry and almost tastless flowers whereas being exposd to a naked fire it affords store of a saline and fretting liquor not to mention this i say i will further observe to you that as it is considerable in the analysis of mixt bodies whether the fire act on them when they are exposd to the open air or shut up in close vessels so is the degree of fire by which the analysis is attempted of no small moment for a milde balneum will sever unfermented blood for instance but into phlegme and caput mortuum the later whereof which i have sometimes had hard brittle and of divers colours transparent almost like tortoiseshell pressd by a good fire in a retort yields a spirit an oyl or two and a volatile salt besides a errata another caput mortuum it may be also pertinent to our present designe to take notice of what happens in the making and distilling of sope for by one degree of fire the salt the water and the oyl or grease whereof that factitious concrete is made up being boyld up together are easily brought to mingle and incorporate into one mass but by another and further degree of heat the same mass may be again divided into an oleagenous an aqueous a saline and an earthy part and so we may observe that impure silver and lead being exposd together to a moderate fire will thereby be colliquated into one mass and mingle per minima as they speak whereas a much vehementer fire will drive or carry off the baser metals i mean the lead and the copper or other alloy from the silver though not for ought appears separate them from one another besides when a vegetable abounding in fixt salt is analyzd by a naked fire as one degree of heat will reduce it into ashes as the chymists themselves teach us so by only a further degree of fire those ashes may be vitrified and turnd into glass i will not stay to examine how far a meere chymist might on this occasion demand if it be lawful for an aristotelian to make ashes which he mistakes for meere earth pass for an element because by one degree of fire it may be producd why a chymist may not upon the like principle argue that glass is one of the elements of many bodies because that also may be obtaind from them barely by the fire i will not i say lose time to examine this but observe that by a method of applying the fire such similar bodies may be obtaind from a concrete as chymists have not been able to separate either by barely burning it in an open fire or by barely distilling it in close vessels for to me it seems very considerable and i wonder that men have taken so little notice of it that i have not by any of the common wayes of distillation in close vessels seen any separation made of such a volatile salt as is afforded us by wood when that is first by an open fire divided into ashes and soot and that soot is afterwards placd in a strong retort and compelld by an urgent fire to part with its spirit oyl and salt for though i dare not peremptorily deny that in the liquors of guajacum and other woods distilld in retorts after the common manner there may be saline parts which by reason of the analogy may pretend to the name of some kinde of volatile salts yet questionless there is a great disparity betwixt such salts and that which we have sometimes obtaind upon the first distillation of soot though for the most part it has not been separated from the first or second rectification and sometimes not till the third for we could never yet see separated from woods analyzd only the vulgar way in close vessels any volatile salt in a dry and saline form as that of soot which we have often had very crystalline and geometrically figurd and then whereas the saline parts of the spirits of guajacum c appear upon distillation sluggish enough the salt of soot seems to be one of the most volatile bodies in all nature and if it be well made will readily ascend with the milde heat of a furnace warmd only by the single wieck of a lamp to the top of the highest glass vessels that are commonly made use of for distillation and besides all this the taste and smell of the salt of soot are exceeding differing from those of the spirits of guajacum c and the former not only smells and tastes much less like a vegetable salt than like that of hartshorn and other animal concretes but in divers other properties seems more of kinne to the family of animals than to that of vegetable salts as i may elsewhere god permitting have an occasion more particularly to declare i might likewise by some other examples manifest that the chymists to have dealt clearly ought to have more explicitly and particularly declard by what degree of fire and in what manner of application of it they would have us judge a division made by the fire to be a true analysis into their principles and the productions of it to deserve the name of elementary bodies but it is time that i proceed to mention the particular reasons that incline me to doubt whether the fire be the true and universal analyzer of mixt bodies of which reasons what has been already objected may pass for one in the next place i observe that there are some mixt bodies from which it has not been yet made appear that any degree of fire can separate either salt or sulphur or mercury much less all the three the most obvious instance of this truth is gold which is a body so fixd and wherein the elementary ingredients if it have any are so firmly united to each other that we finde not in the operations wherein gold is exposd to the fire how violent soever that it does discernably so much as lose of its fixednesse or weight so far is it from being dissipated into those principles whereof one at least is acknowledged to be fugitive enough and so justly did the spagyricall poet somewhere exclaim cuncta adeo miris illic compagibus harent and i must not omit on this occasion to mention to you eleutherius the memorable experiment that i remember i met with in gasto claveus2 who though a lawyer by profession seems to have had no small curiosity and experience in chymical affairs he relates then that having put into one small earthen vessel an ounce of the most pure gold and into another the like weight of pure silver he placd them both in that part of a glasshouse furnace wherein the workmen keep their metal as our english artificers call their liquid glass continually melted and that having there kept both the gold and the silver in constant fusion for two moneths together he afterwards took them out of the furnace and the vessels and weighing both of them again found that the silver had not lost above a 12th part of its weight but the gold had not of his lost any thing at all and though our author endeavours to give us of this a scholastick reason which i suppose you would be as little satisfied with as i was when i read it yet for the matter of fact which will serve our present turne he assures us that though it be strange yet experience it self taught it him to be most true footnote 2 gasto claveus apolog argur chrysopera and though there be not perhaps any other body to be found so perfectly fixd as gold yet there are divers others so fixd or composd at least of so strictly united parts that i have not yet observd the fire to separate from them any one of the chymists principles i need not tell you what complaints the more candid and judicious of the chymists themselves are wont to make of those boasters that confidently pretend that they have extracted the salt or sulphur of quicksilver when they have disguisd it by additaments wherewith it resembles the concretes whose names are given it whereas by a skilful and rigid examen it may be easily enough stript of its disguises and made to appear again in the pristine form of running mercury the pretended salts and sulphurs being so far from being elementary parts extracted out of the bodie of mercurie that they are rather to borrow a terme of the grammarians decompound bodies made up of the whole metal and the menstruum or other additaments imployd to disguise it and as for silver i never could see any degree of fire make it part with any of its three principles and though the experiment lately mentioned from claveus may beget a suspition that silver may be dissipated by fire provided it be extreamly violent and very lasting yet it will not necessarily follow that because the fire was able at length to make the silver lose a little of its weight it was therefore able to dissipate it into its principles for first i might alledge that i have observd little grains of silver to lie hid in the small cavities perhaps glasd over by a vitrifying heat in crucibles wherein silver has been long kept in fusion whence some goldsmiths of my acquaintance make a benefit by grinding such crucibles to powder to recover out of them the latent particles of silver and hence i might argue that perhaps claveus was mistaken and imagind that silver to have been driven away by the fire that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his crucible in whose pores so small a quantity as he mist of so ponderous a bodie might very well lie conceald but secondly admitting that some parts of the silver were driven away by the violence of the fire what proof is there that it was either the salt the sulphur or the mercury of the metal and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remaind for besides that the silver that was left seemd not sensibly alterd which probably would have appeard had so much of any one of its principles been separated from it we finde in other mineral bodies of a less permanent nature than silver that the fire may divide them into such minute parts as to be able to carry them away with its self without at all destroying their nature thus we see that in the refining of silver the lead that is mixd with it to carry away the copper or other ignoble mineral that embases the silver will if it be let alone in time evaporate away upon the test but if as is most usual amongst those that refine great quantities of metals together the lead be blown off from the silver by bellowes that which would else have gone away in the form of unheeded steams will in great part be collected not far from the silver in the form of a darkish powder or calx which because it is blown off from silver they call litharge of silver and thus agricola3 in divers places informs us when copper or the oare of it is colliquated by the violence of the fire with cadmia the sparks that in great multitudes do fly upwards do some of them stick to the vaulted roofs of the furnaces in the form of little and for the most part white bubbles which therefore the greeks and in imitation of them our drugsters call pompholix and others more heavy partly adhere to the sides of the furnace and partly especially if the covers be not kept upon the pots fall to the ground and by reason of their ashy colour as well as weight were called by the same greeks greek spodos which i need not tell you in their language signifies ashes i might add that i have not found that from venetian talck i say venetian because i have found other kinds of that mineral more open from the lapis ossifragus which the shops call ostiocolla from muscovia glass from pure and fusible sand to mention now no other concretes those of my acquaintance that have tryd have been able by the fire to separate any one of the hypostatical principles which you will the less scruple to believe if you consider that glass may be made by the bare colliquation of the salt and earth remaining in the ashes of a burnt plant and that yet common glass once made does so far resist the violence of the fire that most chymists think it a body more undestroyable then gold it self for if the artificer can so firmly unite such comparative gross particles as those of earth and salt that make up common ashes into a body indissoluble by fire why may not nature associate in divers bodies the more minute elementary corpuscles she has at hand too firmly to let them be separable by the fire and on this occasion eleutherius give me leave to mention to you two or three sleight experiments which will i hope be found more pertinent to our present discourse than at first perhaps they will appear the first is that having for tryals sake put a quantity of that fugitive concrete camphire into a glass vessel and placd it in a gentle heat i found it not leaving behinde according to my estimate not so much as one grain to sublime to the top of the vessel into flowers which in whiteness smell c seemd not to differ from the camphire it self another experiment is that of helmont who in several places affirms that a coal kept in a glass exactly closd will never be calcind to ashes though kept never so long in a strong fire to countenance which i shall tell you this tryal of my own that having sometimes distilled some woods as particularly box whilst our caput mortuum remaind in the retort it continued black like charcoal though the retort were earthen and kept redhot in a vehement fire but as soon as ever it was brought out of the candent vessel into the open air the burning coals did hastily degenerate or fall asunder without the assistance of any new calcination into pure white ashes and to these two i shall add but this obvious and known observation that common sulphur if it be pure and freed from its vinager being leasurely sublimd in close vessels rises into dry flowers which may be presently melted into a bodie of the same nature with that which afforded them though if brimstone be burnt in the open air it gives you know a penetrating fume which being caught in a glassbell condenses into that acid liquor called oyl of sulphur per campanam the use i would make of these experiments collated with what i lately told you out of agricola is this that even among the bodies that are not fixt there are divers of such a texture that it will be hard to make it appear how the fire as chymists are wont to imploy it can resolve them into elementary substances for some bodies being of such a texture that the fire can drive them into the cooler and less hot part of the vessels wherein they are included and if need be remove them from place to place to fly the greatest heat more easily than it can divorce their elements especially without the assistance of the air we see that our chymists cannot analyze them in close vessels and of other compound bodies the open fire can as little separate the elements for what can a naked fire do to analyze a mixt bodie if its component principles be so minute and so strictly united that the corpuscles of it need less heat to carry them up than is requisite to divide them into their principles so that of some bodies the fire cannot in close vessels make any analysis at all and others will in the open air fly away in the forms of flowers or liquors before the heat can prove able to divide them into their principles and this may hold whether the various similar parts of a concrete be combind by nature or by art for in factitious sal armoniack we finde the common and the urinous salts so well mingled that both in the open fire and in subliming vessels they rise together as one salt which seems in such vessels irresoluble by fire alone for i can shew you sal armoniack which after the ninth sublimation does still retain its compounded nature and indeed i scarce know any one mineral from which by fire alone chymists are wont to sever any substance simple enough to deserve the name of an element or principle for though out of native cinnaber they distill quicksilver and though from many of those stones that the ancients called pyrites they sublime brimstone yet both that quicksilver and this sulphur being very often the same with the common minerals that are sold in the shops under those names are themselves too much compounded bodies to pass for the elements of such and thus much eleutherius for the second argument that belongs to my first consideration the others i shall the lesse insist on because i have dwelt so long upon this footnote 3 agricola de natura fossil lib 9 cap 11 12 proceed we then in the next place to consider that there are divers separations to be made by other means which either cannot at all or else cannot so well be made by the fire alone when gold and silver are melted into one mass it would lay a great obligation upon refiners and goldsmiths to teach them the art of separating them by the fire without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to sever them whereas they may be very easily parted by the affusion of spirit of nitre or aqua fortis which the french therefore call eau de depart so likewise the metalline part of vitriol will not be so easily and conveniently separated from the saline part even by a violent fire as by the affusion of certain alkalizate salts in a liquid form upon the solution of vitriol made in common water for thereby the acid salt of the vitriol leaving the copper it had corroded to joyn with the added salts the metalline part will be precipitated to the bottom almost like mud and that i may not give instances only in decompound bodies i will add a not useless one of another kinde not only chymists have not been able for ought is vulgarly known by fire alone to separate true sulphur from antimony but though you may finde in their books many plausible processes of extracting it yet he that shall make as many fruitlesse tryals as i have done to obtain it by most of them will i suppose be easily perswaded that the productions of such processes are antimonial sulphurs rather in name than nature but though antimony sublimd by its self is reducd but to a volatile powder or antimonial flowers of a compounded nature like the mineral that affords them yet i remember that some years ago i sublimd out of antimony a sulphur and that in greater plenty then ever i saw obtaind from that mineral by a method which i shall therefore acquaint you with because chymists seem not to have taken notice of what importance such experiments may be in the indagation of the nature and especially of the number of the elements having then purposely for tryals sake digested eight ounces of good and well powderd antimony with twelve ounces of oyl of vitriol in a well stopt glasvessel for about six or seven weeks and having causd the mass grown hard and brittle to be distilld in a retort placd in sand with a strong fire we found the antimony to be so opened or alterd by the menstruum wherewith it had been digested that whereas crude antimony forcd up by the fire arises only in flowers our antimony thus handled afforded us partly in the receiver and partly in the neck and at the top of the retort about an ounce of sulphur yellow and brittle like common brimstone and of so sulphureous a smell that upon the unluting the vessels it infected the room with a scarce supportable stink and this sulphur besides the colour and smell had the perfect inflamability of common brimstone and would immediately kindle at the flame of a candle and burn blew like it and though it seemd that the long digestion wherein our antimony and menstruum were detaind did conduce to the better unlocking of the mineral yet if you have not the leasure to make so long a digestion you may by incorporating with powderd antimony a convenient quantity of oyl of vitriol and committing them immediately to distillation obtain a little sulphur like unto the common one and more combustible than perhaps you will at first take notice of for i have observd that though after its being first kindled the flame would sometimes go out too soon of its self if the same lump of sulphur were held again to the flame of a candle it would be rekindled and burn a pretty while not only after the second but after the third or fourth accension you to whom i think i shewed my way of discovering something of sulphureous in oyl of vitriol may perchance suspect eleutherius either that this substance was some venereal sulphur that lay hid in that liquor and was by this operation only reducd into a manifest body or else that it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the antimony and the saline ones of the vitriol in regard that as gunther4 informs us divers learned men would have sulphur to be nothing but a mixture made in the bowels of the earth of vitriolate spirits and a certain combustible substance but the quantity of sulphur we obtaind by digestion was much too great to have been latent in the oyl of vitriol and that vitriolate spirits are not necessary to the constitution of such a sulphur as ours i could easily manifest if i would acquaint you with the several wayes by which i have obtaind though not in such plenty a sulphur of antimony colourd and combustible like common brimstone and though i am not now minded to discover them yet i shall tell you that to satisfie some ingenious men that distilld vitriolate spirits are not necessary to the obtaining of such a sulphur as we have been considering i did by the bare distillation of only spirit of nitre from its weight of crude antimony separate in a short time a yellow and very inflamable sulphur which for ought i know deserves as much the name of an element as any thing that chymists are wont to separate from any mineral by the fire i could perhaps tell you of other operations upon antimony whereby that may be extracted from it which cannot be forcd out of it by the fire but i shall reserve them for a fitter opportunity and only annex at present this sleight but not impertinent experiment that whereas i lately observed to you that the urinous and common salts whereof sal armoniack consists remaind unseverd by the fire in many successive sublimations they may be easily separated and partly without any fire at all by pouring upon the concrete finely powderd a solution of salt of tartar or of the salt of woodashes for upon your diligently mixing of these you will finde your nose invaded with a very strong smell of urine and perhaps too your eyes forcd to water by the same subtle and piercing body that produces the stink both these effects proceeding from hence that by the alcalizate salt the sea salt that enterd the composition of the sal armoniack is mortifyd and made more fixt and thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile urinous salt which being at once set at liberty and put into motion begins presently to fly away and to offend the nostrils and eyes it meets with by the way and if the operation of these salts be in convenient glasses promoted by warmth though but by that of a bath the ascending steams may easily be caught and reducd into a penetrant spirit abounding with a salt which i have sometimes found to be separable in a crystalline form i might add to these instances that whereas sublimate consisting as you know of salts quicksilver combind and carried up together by heat may be sublimd i know not how often by a like degree of fire without suffering any divorce of the component bodies the mercury may be easily severd from the adhering salts if the sublimate be distilld from salt of tartar quick lime or such alcalizate bodies but i will rather observe to you eleutherius what divers ingenious men have thought somewhat strange that by such an additament that seems but only to promote the separation there may be easily obtaind from a concrete that by the fire alone is easily divisible into all the elements that vegetables are supposd to consist of such a similar substance as differs in many respects from them all and consequently has by many of the most intelligent chymists been denied to be containd in the mixt body for i know a way and have practisd it whereby common tartar without the addition of any thing that is not perfectly a mineral except saltpetre may by one distillation in an earthen retort be made to afford good store of real salt readily dissoluble in water which i found to be neither acid nor of the smell of tartar and to be almost as volatile as spirit of wine it self and to be indeed of so differing a nature from all that is wont to be separated by fire from tartar that divers learned men with whom i discoursd of it could hardly be brought to beleeve that so fugitive a salt could be afforded by tartar till i assurd it them upon my own knowledge and if i did not think you apt to suspect me to be rather too backward than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things i could convince you by what i have yet lying by me of that anomalous salt footnote 4 lib 1 observat cap 6 the fourth thing that i shall alledge to countenance my first consideration is that the fire even when it divides a body into substances of divers consistences does not most commonly analyze it into hypostatical principles but only disposes its parts into new textures and thereby produces concretes of a new indeed but yet of a compound nature this argument it will be requisite for me to prosecute so fully hereafter that i hope you will then confess that tis not for want of good proofs that i desire leave to suspend my proofs till the series of my discourse shall make it more proper and seasonable to propose them it may be further alledgd on the behalf of my first consideration that some such distinct substances may be obtaind from some concretes without fire as deserve no less the name of elementary than many that chymists extort by the violence of the fire we see that the inflamable spirit or as the chymists esteem it the sulphur of wine may not only be separated from it by the gentle heat of a bath but may be distilld either by the help of the sunbeams or even of a dunghill being indeed of so fugitive a nature that it is not easy to keep it from flying away even without the application of external heat i have likewise observd that a vessel full of urine being placd in a dunghill the putrefaction is wont after some weeks so to open the body that the parts disbanding the saline spirit will within no very long time if the vessel be not stopt fly away of it self insomuch that from such urine i have been able to distill little or nothing else than a nauseous phlegme instead of the active and piercing salt and spirit that it would have afforded when first exposd to the fire if the vessel had been carefully stopt and this leads me to consider in the fifth place that it will be very hard to prove that there can no other body or way be given which will as well as the fire divide concretes into several homogeneous substances which may consequently be calld their elements or principles as well as those separated or producd by the fire for since we have lately seen that nature can successefully employ other instruments than the fire to separate distinct substances from mixt bodies how know we but that nature has made or art may make some such substance as may be a fit instrument to analyze mixt bodies or that some such method may be found by humane industry or luck by whose means compound bodies may be resolvd into other substances than such as they are wont to be divided into by the fire and why the products of such an analysis may not as justly be calld the component principles of the bodies that afford them it will not be easy to shew especially since i shall hereafter make it evident that the substances which chymists are wont to call the salts and sulphurs and mercuries of bodies are not so pure and elementary as they presume and as their hypothesis requires and this may therefore be the more freely pressd upon the chymists because neither the paracelsians nor the helmontians can reject it without apparent injury to their respective masters for helmont dos more than once inform his readers that both paracelsus and himself were possessors of the famous liquor alkahest which for its great power in resolving bodies irresoluble by vulgar fires he somewhere seems to call ignis gehenn to this liquor he ascribes and that in great part upon his own experience such wonders that if we suppose them all true i am so much the more a friend to knowledge than to wealth that i should think the alkahest a nobler and more desireable secret than the philosophers stone it self of this universal dissolvent he relates that having digested with it for a competent time a piece of oaken charcoal it was thereby reducd into a couple of new and distinct liquors discriminated from each other by their colour and situation and that the whole body of the coal was reducd into those liquors both of them separable from his immortal menstruum which remaind as fit for such operations as before and he moreover tells us in divers places of his writings that by this powerful and unwearied agent he could dissolve metals marchasites stones vegetable and animal bodies of what kinde soever and even glass it self first reducd to powder and in a word all kinds of mixt bodies in the world into their several similar substances without any residence or caput mortuum and lastly we may gather this further from his informations that the homogeneous substances obtainable from compound bodies by his piercing liquor were oftentimes different enough both as to number and as to nature from those into which the same bodies are wont to be divided by common fire of which i shall need in this place to mention no other proof then that whereas we know that in our common analysis of a mixt body there remains a terrestrial and very fixt substance oftentimes associated with a salt as fixt our author tells us that by his way he could distill over all concretes without any caput mortuum and consequently could make those parts of the concrete volatile which in the vulgar analysis would have been fixt so that if our chymists will not reject the solemn and repeated testimony of a person who cannot but be acknowledgd for one of the greatest spagyrists that they can boast of they must not deny that there is to be found in nature another agent able to analyze compound bodies less violently and both more genuinely and more universally than the fire and for my own part though i cannot but say on this occasion what you know our friend mr boyle is wont to say when he is askt his opinion of any strange experiment that he that hath seen it hath more reason to beleeve it than he that hath not yet i have found helmont so faithful a writer even in divers of his improbable experiments i alwayes except that extravagant treatise de magnetica vulnerum curatione which some of his friends affirm to have been first publishd by his enemies that i think it somewhat harsh to give him the lye especially to what he delivers upon his own proper tryal and i have heard from very credible eyewitnesses some things and seen some others my self which argue so strongly that a circulated salt or a menstruum such as it may be may by being abstracted from compound bodies whether mineral animal or vegetable leave them more unlockt than a wary naturalist would easily beleeve that i dare not confidently measure the power of nature and art by that of the menstruums and other instruments that eminent chymists themselves are as yet wont to empoly errata employ about the analyzing of bodies nor deny that a menstruum may at least from this or that particular concrete obtain some apparently similar substance differing from any obtainable from the same body by any degree or manner of application of the fire and i am the more backward to deny peremptorily that there may be such openers of compound bodies because among the experiments that make me speak thus warily there wanted not some in which it appeard not that one of the substances not separable by common fires and menstruums could retain any thing of the salt by which the separation was made and here eleutherius sayes carneades i should conclude as much of my discourse as belongs to the first consideration i proposd but that i foresee that what i have delivered will appear liable to two such specious objections that i cannot safely proceed any further till i have examind them and first one sort of opposers will be forward to tell me that they do not pretend by fire alone to separate out of all compound bodies their hypostatical principles it being sufficient that the fire divides them into such though afterwards they employ other bodies to collect the similar parts of the compound as tis known that though they make use of water to collect the saline parts of ashes from the terrestrial wherewith they are blended yet it is the fire only that incinerates bodies and reduces the fixd part of them into the salt and earth whereof ashes are made up this objection is not i confess inconsiderable and i might in great part allow of it without granting it to make against me if i would content my self to answer that it is not against those that make it that i have been disputing but against those vulgar chymists who themselves believe and would fain make others do so that the fire is not only an universal but an adquate transcribers note adequate and sufficient instrument to analyze mixt bodies with for as to their practice of extracting the fixd salt out of ashes by the affusion of water tis obvious to alleadge that the water does only assemble together the salt the fire had before divided from the earth as a sieve does not further break the corn but only bring together into two distinct heaps the flour and the bran whose corpuscles before lay promiscuously blended together in the meal this i say i might alleadge and thereby exempt my self from the need of taking any farther notice of the proposd objection but not to lose the rise it may afford me of illustrating the matter under consideration i am content briefly to consider it as far forth as my present disquisition may be concernd in it not to repeat then what has been already answerd i say farther that though i am so civil an adversary that i will allow the chymists after the fire has done all its work the use of fair water to make their extractions with in such cases wherein the water does not cooperate with the fire to make the analysis yet since i grant this but upon supposition that the water does only wash off the saline particles which the fire alone has before extricated in the analyzd body it will not be reasonable that this concession should extend to other liquors that may add to what they dissolve nor so much as to other cases than those newly mentioned which limitation i desire you would be pleasd to bear in mind till i shall anon have occasion to make use of it and this being thus premisd i shall proceed to observe first that many of the instances i proposd in the preceding discourse are such that the objection we are considering will not at all reach them for fire can no more with the assistance of water than without it separate any of the three principles either from gold silver mercury or some others of the concretes named above hence we may inferre that fire is not an universal analyzer of all mixt bodies since of metals and minerals wherein chymists have most exercisd themselves there appear scarce any which they are able to analyze by fire nay from which they can unquestionably separate so much as any one of their hypostatical principles which may well appear no small disparagement as well to their hypothesis as to their pretensions it will also remain true notwithstanding the objection that there may be other wayes than the wonted analysis by fire to separate from a compound body substances as homogeneneous transcribers note homogeneous as those that chymists scruple not to reckon among their tria prima as some of them for brevity sake call their three principles and it appears that by convenient additaments such substances may be separated by the help of the fire as could not be so by the fire alone witness the sulphur of antimony and lastly i must represent that since it appears too that the fire is but one of the instruments that must be employd in the resolution of bodies we may reasonably challenge the liberty of doing two things for when ever any menstruum or other additament is employd together with the fire to obtain a sulphur or a salt from a body we may well take the freedom to examine whether or no that menstruum do barely help to separate the principle obtaind by it or whether there intervene not a coalition of the parts of the body wrought upon with those of the menstruum whereby the producd concrete may be judgd to result from the union of both and it will be farther allowable for us to consider how far any substance separated by the help of such additaments ought to pass for one of the tria prima since by one way of handling the same mixt body it may according to the nature of the additaments and the method of working upon it be made to afford differing substances from those obtainable from it by other additaments and another method nay and as may appear by what i formerly told you about tartar differing from any of the substances into which a concrete is divisible by the fire without additaments though perhaps those additaments do not as ingredients enter the composition of the obtained body but only diversify the operation of the fire upon the concrete and though that concrete by the fire alone may be divided into a number of differing substances as great as any of the chymists that i have met with teach us that of the elements to be and having said thus much sayes carneades to the objection likely to be proposd by some chymists i am now to examine that which i foresee will be confidently pressd by divers peripateticks who to prove fire to be the true analyzer of bodies will plead that it is the very definition of heat given by aristotle and generally received congregare homogenea heterogenea segregare to assemble things of a resembling and disjoyn those of a differing nature to this i answer that this effect is far from being so essential to heat as tis generally imagind for it rather seems that the true and genuine property of heat is to set a moving and thereby to dissociate the parts of bodies and subdivide them into minute particles without regard to their being homogeneous or heterogeneous as is apparent in the boyling of water the distillation of quicksilver or the exposing of bodies to the action of the fire whose parts either are not at least in that degree of heat appear not dissimilar where all that the fire can do is to divide the body into very minute parts which are of the same nature with one another and with their totum as their reduction by condensation evinces and even when the fire seems most so congregare homogenea segregare heterogenea it produces that effect but by accident for the fire does but dissolve the cement or rather shatter the frame or tructure errata structure that kept the heterogeneous parts of bodies together under one common form upon which dissolution the component particles of the mixt being freed and set at liberty do naturally and oftentimes without any operation of the fire associate themselves each with its like or rather do take those places which their several degrees of gravity and levity fixedness or volatility either natural or adventitious from the impression of the fire assigne them thus in the distillation for instance of mans blood the fire dos first begin to dissolve the nexus or cement of the body and then the water being the most volatile and easy to be extracted is either by the igneous atomes or the agitation they are put into by the fire first carried up till forsaken by what carried it up its weight sinks it down into the receiver but all this while the other principles of the concrete remain unseverd and require a stronger degree of heat to make a separation of its more fixt elements and therefore the fire must be increasd which carries over the volatile salt and the spirit they being though beleevd to be differing principles and though really of different consistency yet of an almost equal volatility after them as less fugitive comes over the oyl and leaves behinde the earth and the alcali which being of an equal fixednesse the fire severs them not for all the definition of the schools and if into a redhot earthen or iron retort you cast the matter to be distilld you may observe as i have often done that the predominant fire will carry up all the volatile elements confusedly in one fume which will afterwards take their places in the receiver either according to the degree of their gravity or according to the exigency of their respective textures the salt adhering for the most part to the sides and top and the phlegme fastening it self there too in great drops the oyle and spirit placing themselves under or above one another according as their ponderousness makes them swim or sink for tis observable that though oyl or liquid sulphur be one of the elements separated by this fiery analysis yet the heat which accidentally unites the particles of the other volatile principles has not alwayes the same operation on this there being divers bodies which yield two oyls whereof the one sinks to the bottom of that spirit on which the other swims as i can shew you in some oyls of the same deers blood which are yet by me nay i can shew you two oyls carefully made of the same parcel of humane blood which not only differ extreamly in colour but swim upon one another without mixture and if by agitation confounded will of themselves divorce again and that the fire doth oftentimes divide bodies upon the account that some of their parts are more fixt and some more volatile how far soever either of these two may be from a pure elementary nature is obvious enough if men would but heed it in the burning of wood which the fire dissipates into smoake and ashes for not only the latter of these is confessedly made up of two such differing bodies as earth and salt but the former being condensd into that soot which adheres to our chimneys discovers it self to contain both salt and oyl and spirit and earth and some portion of phlegme too which being all almost equally volatile to that degree of fire which forces them up the more volatile parts helping perhaps as well as the urgency of the fire to carry up the more fixt ones as i have often tryd in dulcifyd colcothar sublimd by sal armoniack blended with it are carried up together but may afterwards be separated by other degrees of fire whose orderly gradation allowes the disparity of their volatileness to discover it self besides if differing bodies united into one mass be both sufficiently fixt the fire finding no parts volatile enough to be expelld or carried up makes no separation at all as may appear by a mixture of colliquated silver and gold whose component metals may be easily severd by aqua fortis or aqua regis according to the predominancy of the silver or the gold but in the fire alone though vehement the metals remain unseverd the fire only dividing the body into smaller particles whose littlenesse may be argud from their fluidity in which either the little nimble atoms of fire or its brisk and numberless strokes upon the vessels hinder rest and continuity without any sequestration of elementary principles moreover the fire sometimes does not separate so much as unite bodies of a differing nature provided they be of an almost resembling fixedness and have in the figure of their parts an aptness to coalition as we see in the making of many plaisters oyntments c and in such metalline mixtures as that made by melting together two parts of clean brass with one of pure copper of which some ingenious tradesmen cast such curious patterns for gold and silver works as i have sometimes taken great pleasure to look upon sometimes the bodies mingled by the fire are differing enough as to fixidity and volatility and yet are so combind by the first operation of the fire that it self does scarce afterwards separate them but only pulverize them whereof an instance is afforded us by the common preparation of mercurius dulcis where the saline particles of the vitriol sea salt and sometimes nitre employd to make the sublimate do so unite themselves with the mercurial particles made use of first to make sublimate and then to dulcifie it that the saline and metalline parts arise together in many successive sublimations as if they all made but one body and sometimes too the fire does not only not sever the differing elements of a body but combine them so firmly that nature her self does very seldom if ever make unions less dissoluble for the fire meeting with some bodies exceedingly and almost equally fixt instead of making a separation makes an union so strict that it self alone is unable to dissolve it as we see when an alcalizate salt and the terrestrial residue of the ashes are incorporated with pure sand and by vitrification made one permanent body i mean the course or greenish sort of glass that mocks the greatest violence of the fire which though able to marry the ingredients of it yet is not able to divorce them i can shew you some pieces of glass which i saw flow down from an earthen crucible purposely exposd for a good while with silver in it to a very vehement fire and some that deal much in the fusion of metals informe me that the melting of a great part of a crucible into glass is no great wonder in their furnaces i remember i have observd too in the melting of great quantities of iron out of the oar by the help of store of charcoal for they affirm that seacoal will not yield a flame strong enough that by the prodigious vehemence of the fire excited by vast bellows made to play by great wheels turnd about by water part of the materials exposd to it was instead of being analyzd colliquated and turnd into a dark solid and very ponderous glass and that in such quantity that in some places i have seen the very highwayes neer such ironworks mended with heaps of such lumps of glasse instead of stones and gravel and i have also observd that some kind of firestone it self having been employd in furnaces wherein it was exposd to very strong and lasting fires has had all its fixt parts so wrought on by the fire as to be perfectly vitrifid which i have tryd by forcing from it pretty large pieces of perfect and transparent glass and lest you might think eleutherius that the questiond definition of heat may be demonstrated by the definition which is wont to be given and acquiescd in of its contrary quality cold whose property is taught to be tam homogenea quam heterogenea congregare give me leave to represent to you that neither is this definition unquestionable for not to mention the exceptions which a logician as such may take at it i consider that the union of heterogeneous bodies which is supposd to be the genuine production of cold is not performd by every degree of cold for we see for instance that in the urine of healthy men when the liquor has been sufferd a while to stand the cold makes a separation of the thinner part from the grosser which subsides to the bottom and growes opacous there whereas if the urinal be warme these parts readily mingle again and the whole liquor becomes transparent as before and when by glaciation wood straw dust water c are supposd to be united into one lump of ice the cold does not cause any real union or adunation if i may so speak of these bodies but only hardening the aqueous parts of the liquor into ice the other bodies being accidentally present in that liquor are frozen up in it but not really united and accordingly if we expose a heap of mony consisting of gold silver and copper coynes or any other bodies of differing natures which are destitute of aqueous moisture capable of congelation to never so intense a cold we find not that these differing bodies are at all thereby so much as compacted much less united together and even in liquors themselves we find phnomena which induce us to question the definition which we are examining if paracelsus his authority were to be lookt upon as a sufficient proof in matters of this nature i might here insist on that process of his whereby he teaches that the essence of wine may be severd from the phlegme and ignoble part by the assistance of congelation and because much weight has been laid upon this process not only by paracelsians but other writers some of whom seem not to have perusd it themselves i shall give you the entire passage in the authors own words as i lately found them in the sixth book of his archidoxis an extract whereof i have yet about me and it sounds thus de vino sciendum est fcem phlegmaque ejus esse mineram vini substantiam esse corpus in quo conservatur essentia prout auri in auro latet essentia juxta quod practicam nobis ad memoriam ponimus ut non obliviscamur ad hunc modum recipe vinum vetustissimum optimum quod habere poteris calore saporeque ad placitum hoc in vas vitreum infundas ut tertiam ejus partem impleat sigillo hermetis occlusum in equino ventre mensibus quatuor in continuato calore teneatur qui non deficiat quo peracto hyeme cum frigus gelu maxime sviunt his per mensem exponatur ut congeletur ad hunc modum frigus vini spiritum una cum ejus substantia protrudit in vini centrum ac separat a phlegmate congelatum abjice quod vero congelatum non est id spiritum cum substantia esse judicato hunc in pelicanum positum in aren digestione non adeo calida per aliquod tempus manere finito postmodum eximito vini magisterium de quo locuti sumus but i dare not eleu lay much weight upon this process because i have found that if it were true it would be but seldom practicable in this country upon the best wine for though this present winter hath been extraordinary cold yet in very keen frosts accompanied with lasting snowes i have not been able in any measure to freeze a thin vial full of sack and even with snow and salt i could freeze little more then the surface of it and i suppose eleu that tis not every degree of cold that is capable of congealing liquors which is able to make such an analysis if i may so call it of them by separating their aqueous and spirituous parts for i have sometimes though not often frozen severally redwine urine and milk but could not observe the expected separation and the dutchmen that were forcd to winter in that icie region neer the artick circle calld nova zembla although they relate as we shall see below that there was a separation of parts made in their frozen beer about the middle of november yet of the freezing of their back errata sack in december following they give but this account yea and our sack which is so hot was frozen very hard so that when we were every man to have his part we were forcd to melt it in the fire which we shard every second day about half a pinte for a man wherewith we were forcd to sustain our selves in which words they imply not that their back errata sack was divided by the frost into differing substances after such manner as their beer had been all which notwithstanding eleu suppose that it may be made to appear that even cold sometimes may congregare homogenea heterogenea segregare and to manifest this i may tell you that i did once purposely cause to be decocted in fair water a plant abounding with sulphureous and spirituous parts and having exposd the decoction to a keen northwind in a very frosty night i observd that the more aqueous parts of it were turnd by the next morning into ice towards the innermost part of which the more agile and spirituous parts as i then conjecturd having retreated to shun as much as might be their environing enemy they had there preservd themselves unfrozen in the form of a high colourd liquor the aqueous and spirituous parts having been so sleightly blended rather than united in the decoction that they were easily separable by such a degree of cold as would not have been able to have divorcd the parts of urine or wine which by fermentation or digestion are wont as tryal has informd me to be more intimately associated each with other but i have already intimated eleutherius that i shall not insist on this experiment not only because having made it but once i may possibly have been mistaken in it but also and that principally because of that much more full and eminent experiment of the separative virtue of extream cold that was made against their wills by the forementiond dutch men that winterd in nova zembla the relation of whose voyage being a very scarce book it will not be amiss to give you that memorable part of it which concerns our present theme as i causd the passage to be extracted out of the englished voyage it self gerard de veer john cornelyson and others sent out of amsterdam anno dom 1596 being forcd by unseasonable weather to winter in nova zembla neer icehaven on the thirteenth of october three of us sayes the relation went aboard the ship and laded a sled with beer but when we had laden it thinking to go to our house with it suddenly there arose such a winde and so great a storm and cold that we were forcd to go into the ship again because we were not able to stay without and we could not get the beer into the ship again but were forcd to let it stand without upon the sled the fourteenth as we came out of the ship we found the barrel of beer standing upon the sled but it was fast frozen at the heads yet by reason of the great cold the beer that purgd out froze as hard upon the side of the barrel as if it had been glud thereon and in that sort we drew it to our house and set the barrel an end and drank it up but first we were forcd to melt the beer for there was scarce any unfrozen beer in the barrel but in that thick yiest that was unfrozen lay the strength of the beer so that it was too strong to drink alone and that which was frozen tasted like water and being melted we mixd one with the other and so drank it but it had neither strength nor taste and on this occasion i remember that having the last very sharp winter purposely tryd to freeze among other liquors some beer moderately strong in glass vessels with snow and salt i observd that there came out of the neck a certain thick substance which it seems was much better able then the rest of the liquor that i found turnd into ice to resist a frost and which by its colour and consistence seemd mafestly transcribers note manifestly enough to be yiest whereat i confess i somewhat marvaild because i did not either discerne by the taste or find by enquiry that the beer was at all too new to be very fit to be drank i might confirm the dutchmens relation by what happend a while since to a neere friend of mine who complained to me that having brewd some beer or ale for his own drinking in holland where he then dwelt the keenness of the late bitter winter froze the drink so as to reduce it into ice and a small proportion of a very strong and spirituous liquor but i must not entertain you any longer concerning cold not onely because you may think i have but lost my way into a theme which does not directly belong to my present undertaking but because i have already enlargd my self too much upon the first consideration i proposd though it appears so much a paradox that it seemd to require that i should say much to keep it from being thought a meere extravagance yet since i undertook but to make the common assumption of our chymists and aristotelians appear questionable i hope i have so performd that task that i may now proceed to my following considerations and insist lesse on them than i have done on the first the sceptical chymist the second part the second consideration i desire to have notice taken of is this that it is not so sure as both chymists and aristotelians are wont to think it that every seemingly similar or distinct substance that is separated from a body by the help of the fire was pre existent in it as a principle or element of it that i may not make this paradox a greater then i needs must i will first briefly explain what the proposition means before i proceed to argue for it and i suppose you will easily believe that i do not mean that any thing is separable from a body by fire that was not materially preexistent in it for it far exceeds the power of meerly naturall agents and consequently of the fire to produce anew so much as one atome of matter which they can but modifie and alter not create which is so obvious a truth that almost all sects of philosophers have denyd the power of producing matter to second causes and the epicureans and some others have done the like in reference to their gods themselves nor does the proposition peremptorily deny but that some things obtaind by the fire from a mixt body may have been more then barely materially preexistent in it since there are concretes which before they be exposd to the fire afford us several documents of their abounding some with salt and others with sulphur for it will serve the present turn if it appear that diverse things obtaind from a mixt body exposd to the fire were not its ingredients before for if this be made to appear it will errata appear it will be rationall enough to suspect that chymists may decieve themselves and others in concluding resolutely and universally those substances to be the elementary ingredients of bodies barely separated by the fire of which it yet may be doubted whether there be such or no at least till some other argument then that drawn from the analysis be brought to resolve the doubt that then which i mean by the proposition i am explaining is that it may without absurdity be doubted whether or no the differing substances obtainable from a concrete dissipated by the fire were so exsistent in it in that forme at least as to their minute parts wherein we find them when the analysis is over that the fire did only disjoyne and extricate the corpuscles of one principle from those of the other wherewith before they were blended having thus explaind my proposition i shall endeavour to do two things to prove it the first of which is to shew that such substances as chymists call principles may be producd de novo as they speak and the other is to make it probable that by the fire we may actually obtain from some mixt bodies such substances as were not in the newly expounded sence preexistent in them to begin then with the first of these i consider that if it be as true as tis probable that compounded bodies differ from one another but in the various textures resulting from the bigness shape motion and contrivance of their smal parts it will not be irrationall to conceive that one and the same parcel of the universal matter may by various alterations and contextures be brought to deserve the name somtimes of a sulphureous and sometimes of a terrene or aqueous body and this i could more largely explicate but that our friend mr boyle has promisd us something about qualities wherein the theme i now willingly resign him will i question not be studiously enquired into wherefore what i shall now advance in favour of what i have lately deliverd shall be deducd from experiments made divers years since the first of which would have been much more considerable but that by some intervening accidents i was necessitated to lose the best time of the year for a trial of the nature of that i designd it being about he transcribers note the middle of may before i was able to begin an experiment which should have then been two moneths old but such as it was it will not perhaps be impertinent to give you this narrative of it at the time newly mentiond i causd my gardiner being by urgent occasions hinderd from being present myself to dig out a convenient quantity of good earth and dry it well in an oven to weigh it to put it in an earthen pot almost level with the surface of the ground and to set in it a selected seed he had before received from me for that purpose of squash which is an indian kind of pompion that growes apace this seed i ordered him to water only with rain or spring water i did not when my occasions permitted me to visit it without delight behold how fast it grew though unseasonably sown but the hastning winter hinderd it from attaining any thing neer its due and wonted magnitude for i found the same autumn in my garden some of those plants by measure as big about as my middle and made me order the having it taken up which about the middle of october was carefully done by the same gardiner who a while after sent me this account of it i have weighed the pompion with the stalk and leaves all which weighed three pound wanting a quarter then i took the earth baked it as formerly and found it just as much as i did at first which made me think i had not dryd it sufficiently then i put it into the oven twice more after the bread was drawn and weighed it the second time but found it shrink little or nothing but to deal candidly with you eleutherius i must not conceal from you the event of another experiment of this kind made this present summer wherein the earth seems to have been much more wasted as may appear by the following account lately sent me by the same gardiner in these words to give you an account of your cucumbers i have gaind two indifferent fair ones the weight of them is ten pound and a halfe the branches with the roots weighed four pounds wanting two ounces and when i had weighed them i took the earth and bakd it in several small earthen dishes in an oven and when i had so done i found the earth wanted a pound and a halfe of what it was formerly yet i was not satisfid doubting the earth was not dry i put it into an oven the second time after the bread was drawn and after i had taken it out and weighed it i found it to be the same weight so i suppose there was no moisture left in the earth neither do i think that the pound and halfe that was wanting was drawn away by the cucumber but a great part of it in the ordering was in dust and the like wasted the cucumbers are kept by themselves lest you should send for them but yet in this tryal eleutherius it appears that though some of the earth or rather the dissoluble salt harbourd in it were wasted the main body of the plant consisted of transmuted water and i might add that a year after i causd the formerly mentioned experiment touching large pompions to be reiterated with so good success that if my memory does not much misinform me it did not only much surpass any that i made before but seemd strangely to conclude what i am pleading for though by reason i have unhappily lost the particular account my gardiner writ me up of the circumstances i dare not insist upon them the like experiment may be as conveniently tryd with the seeds of any plant whose growth is hasty and its size bulky if tobacco will in these cold climates grow well in earth undungd it would not be amiss to make a tryal with it for tis an annual plant that arises where it prospers sometimes as high as a tall man and i have had leaves of it in my garden neer a foot and a halfe broad but the next time i try this experiment it shall be with several seeds of the same sort in the same pot of earth that so the event may be the more conspicuous but because every body has not conveniency of time and place for this experiment neither i made in my chamber some shorter and more expeditions transcribers note expeditious tryals i took a top of spearmint about an inch long and put it into a good vial full of spring water so as the upper part of the mint was above the neck of the glass and the lower part immersd in the water within a few dayes this mint began to shoot forth roots into the water and to display its leaves and aspire upwards and in a short time it had numerous roots and leaves and these very strong and fragrant of the odour of the mint but the heat of my chamber as i suppose killd the plant when it was grown to have a pretty thick stalk which with the various and ramified roots which it shot into the water as if it had been earth presented in its transparent flowerpot a spectacle not unpleasant to behold the like i tryd with sweet marjoram and i found the experiment succeed also though somewhat more slowly with balme and peniroyal to name now no other plants and one of these vegetables cherishd only by water having obtaind a competent growth i did for tryals sake cause to be distilld in a small retort and thereby obtaind some phlegme a little empyreumaticall spirit a small quantity of adust oyl and a caput mortuum which appearing to be a coal concluded it to consist of salt and earth but the quantity of it was so small that i forbore to calcine it the water i usd to nourish this plant was not shifted nor renewed and i chose springwater rather than rainwater because the latter is more discernably a kinde of greek panspermia which though it be granted to be freed from grosser mixtures seems yet to contain in it besides the steams of several bodies wandering in the air which may be supposd to impregnate it a certain spirituous substance which may be extracted out of it and is by some mistaken for the spirit of the world corporifyd upon what grounds and with what probability i may elsewhere perchance but must not now discourse to you but perhaps i might have savd a great part of my labour for i finde that helmont an author more considerable for his experiments than many learned men are pleasd to think him having had an opportunity to prosecute an experiment much of the same nature with those i have been now speaking of for five years together obtaind at the end of that time so notable a quantity of transmuted water that i should scarce think it fit to have his experiment and mine mentiond together were it not that the length of time requisite to this may deterr the curiosity of some and exceed the leasure of others and partly that so paradoxical a truth as that which these experiments seem to hold forth needs to be confirmd by more witnesses then one especially since the extravagancies and untruths to be met with in helmonts treatise of the magnetick cure of wounds have made his testimonies suspected in his other writings though as to some of the unlikely matters of fact he delivers in them i might safely undertake to be his compurgator but that experiment of his which i was mentioning to you he sayes was this he took 200 pound of earth dryd in an oven and having put it into an earthen vessel and moistend it with raine water he planted in it the trunk of a willow tree of five pound weight this he waterd as need required with rain or with distilld water and to keep the neighbouring earth from getting into the vessell he employd a plate of iron tinnd over and perforated with many holes five years being effluxd he took out the tree and weighed it and with computing the leaves that fell during four autumnes he found it to weigh 169 pound and about three ounces and having again dryd the earth it grew in he found it want of its former weight of 200 pound about a couple only of ounces so that 164 pound of the roots wood and bark which constituted the tree seem to have sprung from the water and though it appears not that helmont had the curiosity to make any analysis of this plant yet what i lately told you i did to one of the vegetables i nourishd with water only will i suppose keep you from doubting that if he had distilld this tree it would have afforded him the like distinct substances as another vegetable of the same kind i need not subjoyne that i had it also in my thoughts to try how experiments to the same purpose with those i related to you would succeed in other bodies then vegetables because importunate avocations having hitherto hinderd me from putting my design in practise i can yet speak but confecturally transcribers note conjecturally of the success but the best is that the experiments already made and mentiond to you need not the assistance of new ones to verifie as much as my present task makes it concern me to prove by experiments of this nature one would suspect sayes eleutherius after his long silence by what you have been discoursing that you are not far from helmonts opinion about the origination of compound bodies and perhaps too dislike not the arguments which he imployes to prove it what helmontian opinion and what arguments do you mean askes carneades what you have been newly discoursing replies eleutherius tells us that you cannot but know that this bold and acute spagyrist scruples not to assert that all mixt bodies spring from one element and that vegetables animals marchasites stones metalls c are materially but simple water disguisd into these various formes by the plastick or formative virtue of their seeds and as for his reasons you may find divers of them scatterd up and down his writings the considerablst of which seem to be these three the ultimate reduction of mixt bodies into insipid water the vicissitude of the supposed elements and the production of perfectly mixt bodies out of simple water and first he affirmes that the sal circulatus paracelsi or his liquor alkahest does adequately resolve plants animals and mineralls into one liquor or more according to their several internall disparities of parts without caput mortuum or the destruction of their seminal virtues and that the alkahest being abstracted from these liquors in the same weight and virtue wherewith it dissolvd them the liquors may by frequent cohobations from chalke or some other idoneous matter be totally deprivd of their seminal endowments and return at last to their first matter insipid water some other wayes he proposes here and there to divest some particular bodies of their borrowd shapes and make them remigrate to their first simplicity the second topick whence helmont drawes his arguments to prove water to be the material cause of mixt bodies i told you was this that the other supposd elements may be transmuted into one another but the experiments by him here and there producd on this occasion are so uneasie to be made and to be judgd of that i shall not insist on them not to mention that if they were granted to be true his inference from them is somewhat disputable and therefore i shall pass on to tell you that as in his first argument our paradoxical author endeavours to prove water the sole element of mixt bodies by their ultimate resolution when by his alkahest or some other conquering agent the seeds have been destroyd which disguisd them or when by time those seeds are wearid or exantlated or unable to act their parts upon the stage of the universe any longer so in his third argument he endeavours to evince the same conclusion by the constitution of bodies which he asserts to be nothing but water subdud by seminal virtues of this he gives here and there in his writings several instances as to plants and animals but divers of them being difficult either to be tryd or to be understood and others of them being not altogether unobnoxious to exceptions i think you have singld out the principal and less questionable experiment when you lately mentiond that of the willow tree and having thus continues eleutherius to answer your question given you a summary account of what i am confident you know better then i do i shall be very glad to receive your sence of it if the giving it me will not too much divert you from the prosecution of your discourse that if replies carneades was not needlessly annexd for thorowly to examine such an hypothesis and such arguments would require so many considerations and consequently so much time that i should not now have the liesure errata leasure to perfect such a digression and much less to finish my principle errata principal discourse yet thus much i shall tell you at present that you need not fear my rejecting this opinion for its novelty since however the helmontians may in complement to their master pretend it to be a new discovery yet though the arguments be for the most part his the opinion it self is very antient for diogenes laertius and divers other authors speak of thales as the first among the grcians that made disquisitions upon nature and of this thales i remember tully5 informes us that he taught all things were at first made of water and it seems by plutarch and justin martyr that the opinion was ancienter then he for they tell us that he usd to defend his tenet by the testimony of homer and a greek author the scholiast of apollonius upon these words greek ex iliou transcribers note iluos eblastse chthn aut6 the earth of slime was made affirms out of zeno that the chaos whereof all things were made was according to hesiod water which settling first became slime and then condensd into solid earth and the same opinion about the generation of slime seems to have been entertaind by orpheus out of whom one of the antients7 cites this testimony greek ek tou hydatos ilui katist of water slime was made footnote 5 de natura deorum footnote 6 argonaut 4 footnote 7 athenagoras it seems also by what is delivered in strabo8 out of another author concerning the indians that they likewise held that all things had differing beginnings but that of which the world was made was water and the like opinion has been by some of the antients ascribd to the phoenicians from whom thales himself is conceivd to have borrowd it as probably the greeks did much of their theologie and as i am apt to think of their philosophy too since the devising of the atomical hypothesis commonly ascribd to lucippus and his disciple democritus is by learned men attributed to one moschus a phoenician and possibly the opinion is yet antienter than so for tis known that the phoenicians borrowd most of their learning from the hebrews and among those that acknowledge the books of moses many have been inclind to think water to have been the primitive and universal matter by perusing the beginning of genesis where the waters seem to be mentiond as the material cause not only of sublunary compounded bodies but of all those that make up the universe whose component parts did orderly as it were emerge out of that vast abysse by the operation of the spirit of god who is said to have been moving himself as hatching females do as the original hebrew merachephet meracephet9 is said to import and as it seems to signifie in one of the two other places wherein alone i have met with it in the hebrew bible10 upon the face of the waters which being as may be supposd divinely impregnated with the seeds of all things were by that productive incubation qualifyd to produce them but you i presume expect that i should discourse of this matter like a naturalist not a philologer wherefore i shall add to countenance helmonts opinion that whereas he gives not that i remember any instance of any mineral body nor scarce of any animal generated of water a french chymist monsieur de rochas has presented his readers an experiment which if it were punctually such as he has deliverd it is very notable he then discoursing of the generation of things according to certain chymical and metaphorical notions which i confess are not to me intelligible sets down among divers speculations not pertinent to our subject the following narrative which i shall repeat to you the sence of in english with as little variation from the literal sence of the french words as my memory will enable me having sayes he discernd such great wonders by the natural operation of water i would know what may be done with it by art imitating nature wherefore i took water which i well knew not to be compounded nor to be mixd with any other thing than that spirit of life whereof he had spoken before and with a heat artificial continual and proportionate i prepard and disposd it by the above mentiond graduations of coagulation congelation and fixation untill it was turnd into earth which earth producd animals vegetables and minerals i tell not what animals vegetables and minerals for that is reservd for another occasion but the animals did move of themselves eat cand by the true anatomie i made of them i found that they were composd of much sulphur little mercury and less saltthe minerals began to grow and encrease by converting into their own nature one part of the earth thereunto disposd they were solid and heavy and by this truly demonstrative science namely chymistry i found that they were composd of much salt little sulphur and less mercury footnote 8 universarum rerum primordia diverta esse faciendi autem mundi initium aquam strabo geograp lib 15 circa medium footnote 9 deuter 32 11 footnote 10 jerem 23 9 but sayes carneades i have some suspitions concerning this strange relation which make me unwilling to declare an opinion of it unless i were satisfied concerning divers material circumstances that our author has left unmentioned though as for the generation of living creatures both vegetable and sensitive it needs not seem incredible since we finde that our common water which indeed is often impregnated with variety of seminal principles and rudiments being long kept in a quiet place will putrifie and stink and then perhaps too produce moss and little worms or other insects according to the nature of the seeds that were lurking in it i must likewise desire you to take notice that as helmont gives us no instance of the production of minerals out of water so the main argument that he employs to prove that they and other bodies may be resolvd into water is drawn from the operations of his alkahest and consequently cannot be satisfactorily examind by you and me yet certainly sayes eleutherius you cannot but have somewhat wonderd as well as i to observe how great a share of water goes to the making up of divers bodies whose disguises promise nothing neere so much the distillation of eeles though it yielded me some oyle and spirit and volatile salt besides the caput mortuum yet were all these so disproportionate to the phlegm that came from them and in which at first they boyld as in a pot of water that they seemd to have bin nothing but coagulated phlegm which does likewise strangely abound in vipers though they are esteemd very hot in operation and will in a convenient aire survive some dayes the loss of their heads and hearts so vigorous is their vivacity mans bloud it self as spirituous and as elaborate a liquor as tis reputed does so abound in phlegm that the other day distilling some of it on purpose to try the experiment as i had formerly done in deers bloud out of about seven ounces and a half of pure bloud we drew neere six ounces of phlegm before any of the more operative principles began to arise and invite us to change the receiver and to satisfie my self that some of these animall phlegms were void enough of spirit to deserve that name i would not content my self to taste them only but fruitlesly pourd on them acid liquors to try if they containd any volatile salt or spirit which had there been any there would probably have discoverd it self by making an ebullition with the affused liquor and now i mention corrosive spirits i am minded to informe you that though they seem to be nothing else but fluid salts yet they abound in water as you may observe if either you entangle and so fix their saline part by making them corrode some idoneous body or else if you mortifie it with a contrary salt as i have very manifestly observd in the making a medecine somewhat like helmonts balsamus samech with distilld vinager instead of spirit of wine wherewith he prepares it for you would scarce beleeve what i have lately observd that of that acid spirit the salt of tartar from which it is distilld will by mortifying and retaining the acid salt turn into worthless phlegm neere twenty times its weight before it be so fully impregnated as to rob no more distilld vinager of its salt and though spirit of wine exquisitely rectifyd seem of all liquors to be the most free from water it being so igneous that it will flame all away without leaving the least drop behinde it yet even this fiery liquor is by helmont not improbably affirmd in case what he relates be true to be materially water under a sulphureous disguise for according to him in the making that excellent medecine paracelsus his balsamus samech which is nothing but sal tartari dulcifyd by distilling from it spirit of wine till the salt be sufficiently glutted with its sulphur and suffer errata and till it suffer the liquor to be drawn off as strong as it was pourd on when the salt of tartar from which it is distilld hath retaind or deprivd it of the sulphureous parts of the spirit of wine the rest which is incomparably the greater part of the liquor will remigrate into phlegm i added that clause in case what he relates be true because i have not as yet sufficiently tryd it my self but not only something of experiment keeps me from thinking it as many chymists do absurd though i have as well as they in vain tryd it with ordinary salt of tartar but besides that helmont often relates it and draws consequences from it a person noted for his sobernesse and skill in spagyrical preparations having been askt by me whether the experiment might not be made to succeed if the salt and spirit were prepard according to a way suitable to my principles he affirmd to me that he had that way i proposd made helmonts experiment succeed very well without adding any thing to the salt and spirit but our way is neither short nor easie i have indeed sayes carneades sometimes wonderd to see how much phlegme may be obtaind from bodies by the fire but concerning that phlegme i may anon have occasion to note something which i therefore shall not now anticipate but to return to the opinion of thales and of helmont i consider that supposing the alkahest could reduce all bodies into water yet whether that water because insipid must be elementary may not groundlesly be doubted for i remember the candid and eloquent petrus laurembergius in his notes upon salas aphorismes affirmes that he saw an insipid menstruum that was a powerfull dissolvent and if my memory do not much misinforme me could dissolve gold and the water which may be drawn from quicksilver without addition though it be almost tastless you will i believe think of a differing nature from simple water especially if you digest in it appropriated mineralls to which i shall add but this that this consideration may be further extended for i see no necessity to conceive that the water mentiond in the beginning of genesis as the universal matter was simple and elementary water since though we should suppose it to have been an agitated congeries or heap consisting of a great variety of seminal principles and rudiments and of other corpuscles fit to be subdud and fashiond by them it might yet be a body fluid like water in case the corpuscles it was made up of were by their creator made small enough and put into such an actuall motion as might make them glide along one another and as we now say the sea consists of water notwithstanding errata notwithstanding the saline terrestrial and other bodies mingld with it such a liquor may well enough be called water because that was the greatest of the known bodies whereunto it was like though that a body may be fluid enough to appear a liquor and yet contain corpuscles of a very differing nature you will easily believe if you but expose a good quantity of vitriol in a strong vessel to a competent fire for although it contains both aqueous earthy saline sulphureous and metalline corpuscles yet the whole mass will at first be fluid like water and boyle like a seething pot i might easily continues carneades enlarge my self on such considerations if i were now obligd to give you my judgment of the thalesian and helmontian hypothesis but whether or no we conclude that all things were at first generated of water i may deduce from what i have tryd concerning the growth of vegetables nourishd with water all that i now proposd to my self or need at present to prove namely that salt spirit earth and evn oyl though that be thought of all bodies the most opposite to water may be producd out of water and consequently that a chymical principle as well as a peripatetick element may in some cases be generated anew or obtaind from such a parcel of matter as was not endowd with the form of such a principle or element before and having thus eleutherius evincd that tis possible that such substances as those that chymists are wont to call their tria prima may be generated anew i must next endeavour to make it probable that the operation of the fire does actually sometimes not only divide compounded bodies into smal parts but compound those parts after a new manner whence consequently for ought we know there may emerge as well saline and sulphureous substances as bodies of other textures and perhaps it will assist us in our enquiry after the effects of the operations of the fire upon other bodies to consider a little what it does to those mixtures which being productions of the art of man we best know the composition of you may then be pleasd to take notice that though sope is made up by the sopeboylers of oyle or grease and salt and water diligently incorporated together yet if you expose the mass they constitute to a graduall fire in a retort you shall then indeed make a separation but not of the same substances that were united into sope but of others of a distant and yet not an elementary nature and especially of an oyle very sharp and ftid and of a very differing quality from that which was employd to make the sope fo errata so if you mingle in a due proportion sal armoniack with quicklime and distill them by degrees of fire you shall not divide the sal armoniack from the quicklime though the one be a volatile and the other a fixd substance but that which will ascend will be a spirit much more fugitive penetrant and stinking then sal armoniack and there will remain with the quicklime all or very near all the sea salt that concurrd to make up the sal armoniack concerning which sea salt i shall to satisfie you how well it was united to the lime informe you that i have by making the fire at length very vehement causd both the ingredients to melt in the retort it self into one mass and such masses are apt to relent in the moist air if it be here objected that these instances are taken from factitious concretes which are more compounded then those which nature produces i shall reply that besides that i have mentiond them as much to illustrate what i proposd as to prove it it will be difficult to evince that nature her self does not make decompound bodies i mean mingle together such mixt bodies as are already compounded of elementary or rather of more simple ones for vitriol for instance though i have sometimes taken it out of minerall earths where nature had without any assistance of art prepard it to my hand is really though chymists are pleasd to reckon it among salts a decompounded body consisting as i shall have occasion to declare anon of a terrestriall substance of a metal and also of at least one saline body of a peculiar and not elementary nature and we see also in animals that their blood may be composd of divers very differing mixt bodies since we find it observd that divers seafowle tast rank of the fish on which they ordinarily feed and hipocrates himself observes that a child may be purgd by the milke of the nurse if she have taken elaterium which argues that the purging corpuscles of the medicament concurr to make up the milke of the nurse and that white liquor is generally by physitians supposd to be but blanchd and alterd blood and i remember i have observd not farr from the alps that at a certain time of the year the butter of that country was very offensive to strangers by reason of the rank tast of a certain herb whereon the cows were then wont plentifully to feed but proceeds carneades to give you instances of another kind to shew that things may be obtaind by the fire from a mixt body that were not preexistent in it let me remind you that from many vegetables there may without any addition be obtaind glass a body which i presume you will not say was preexistent in it but producd by the fire to which i shall add but this one example more namely that by a certain artificial way of handling quicksilver you may without addition separate from it at least a 5th or 4th part of a clear liquor which with an ordinary peripatetick would pass for water and which a vulgar chymist would not scruple to call phlegme and which for ought i have yet seen or heard is not reducible into mercury again and consequently is more then a disguise of it now besides that divers chymists will not allow mercury to have any or at least any considerable quantity of either of the ignoble ingredients earth and water besides this i say the great ponderousness of quicksilver makes it very unlikely that it can have so much water in it as may be thus obtaind from it since mercury weighs 12 or 14 times as much as water of the same bulk nay for a further confirmation of this argument i will add this strange relation that two friends of mine the one a physitian and the other a mathematician and both of them persons of unsuspected credit have solemnly assured me that after many tryals they made to reduce mercury into water in order to a philosophicall work upon gold which yet by the way i know provd unsuccesfull they did once by divers cohobations reduce a pound of quicksilver into almost a pound of water and this without the addition of any other substance but only by pressing the mercury by a skillfully managd fire in purposely contrivd vessels but of these experiments our friend sayes carneades pointing at the register of this dialogue will perhaps give you a more particular account then it is necessary for me to do since what i have now said may sufficiently evince that the fire may sometimes as well alter bodies as divide them and by it we may obtain from a mixt body what was not preexistent in it and how are we sure that in no other body what we call phlegme is barely separated not producd by the action of the fire since so many other mixt bodies are of a much less constant and more alterable nature then mercury by many tricks it is wont to put upon chymists and by the experiments i told you of about an hour since appears to be but because i shall ere long have occasion to resume into consideration the power of the fire to produce new concretes i shall no longer insist on this argument at present only i must mind you that if you will not disbelieve helmonts relations you must confess that the tria prima are neither ingenerable nor incorruptible substances since by his alkahest some of them may be producd of bodies that were before of another denomination and by the same powerfull menstruum all of them may be reducd into insipid water here carneades was about to pass on to his third consideration when eleutherius being desirous to hear what he could say to clear his second general consideration from being repugnant to what he seemd to think the true theory of mistion prevented him by telling him i somewhat wonder carneades that you who are in so many points unsatisfied with the peripatetick opinion touching the elements and mixt bodies should also seem averse to that notion touching the manner of mistion wherein the chymists though perhaps without knowing that they do so agree with most of the antient philosophers that preceded aristotle and that for reasons so considerable that divers modern naturalists and physitians in other things unfavourable enough to the spagyrists do in this case side with them against the common opinion of the schools if you should ask me continues eleutherius what reasons i mean i should partly by the writings of sennertus and other learned men and partly by my own thoughts be supplyd with more then twere at present proper for me to insist largely on and therefore i shall mention only and that briefly three or four of these i shall take the first from the state of the controversie itself and the genuine notion of mistion which though much intricated by the schoolmen i take in short to be this aristotle at least as many of his interpreters expound him and as indeed he teaches in some places where he professedly dissents from the antients declares mistion to be such a mutual penetration and perfect union of the mingld elements that there is no portion of the mixt body how minute soever which does not contain all and every of the four elements or in which if you please all the elements are not and i remember that he reprehends the mistion taught by the ancients as too sleight or gross for this reason that bodies mixt according to their hypothesis though they appear so to humane eyes would not appear such to the acute eyes of a lynx whose perfecter sight would discerne the elements if they were no otherwise mingled than as his predecessors would have it to be but blended not united whereas the antients though they did not all agree about what kind of bodies were mixt yet they did almost unanimously hold that in a compounded bodie though the miscibilia whether elements principles or whatever they pleasd to call them were associated in such small parts and with so much exactness that there was no sensible part of the mass but seemd to be of the same nature with the rest and with the whole yet as to the atomes or other insensible parcels of matter whereof each of the miscibilia consisted they retaind each of them its own nature being but by apposition or juxtaposition united with the rest into one bodie so that although by virtue of this composition the mixt body did perhaps obtain divers new qualities yet still the ingredients that compounded it retaining their own nature were by the destruction of the compositum separable from each other the minute parts disingagd from those of a differing nature and associated with those of their own sort returning to be again fire earth or water as they were before they chancd to be ingredients of that compositum this may be explaind continues eleutherius by a piece of cloath made of white and black threds interwoven wherein though the whole piece appear neither white nor black but of a resulting colour that is gray yet each of the white and black threds that compose it remains what it was before as would appear if the threds were pulld asunder and sorted each colour by it self this pursues eleutherius being as i understand it the state of the controversie and the aristotelians after their master commonly defining that mistion is miscibilium alteratorum unio that seems to comport much better with the opinion of the chymists then with that of their adversaries since according to that as the newly mentiond example declares there is but a juxtaposition of separable corpuscles retaining each its own nature whereas according to the aristotelians when what they are pleasd to call a mixt body results from the concourse of the elements the miscibilia cannot so properly be said to be alterd as destroyd since there is no part in the mixt body how small soever that can be calld either fir transcribers note fire or air or water or earth nor indeed can i well understand how bodies can be mingld other wayes then as i have declard or at least how they can be mingld as our peripateticks would have it for whereas aristotle tells us that if a drop of wine be put into ten thousand measures of water the wine being overpowerd by so vast a quantity of water will be turnd into it he speaks to my apprehension very improbably for though one should add to that quantity of water as many drops of wine as would a thousand times exceed it all yet by his rule the whole liquor should not be a crama a mixture of wine and water wherein the wine would be predominant but water only since the wine being added but by a drop at a time would still fall into nothing but water and consequently would be turnd into it and if this would hold in metals too twere a rare secret for goldsmiths and refiners for by melting a mass of gold or silver and by but casting into it lead or antimony grain after grain they might at pleasure within a reasonable compass of time turn what quantity they desire of the ignoble into the noble metalls and indeed since a pint of wine and a pint of water amount to about a quart of liquor it seems manifest to sense that these bodies doe not totally penetrate one another as one would have it but that each retains its own dimensions and consequently that they are by being mingld only divided into minute bodies that do but touch one another with their surfaces as do the grains of wheat rye barley c in a heap of severall sorts of corn and unless we say that as when one measure of wheat for instance is blended with a hundred measures of barley there happens only a juxtaposition and superficial contact betwixt the grains of wheat and as many or thereabouts of the grains of barley so when a drop of wine is mingld with a great deal of water there is but an apposition of so many vinous corpuscles to a correspondent number of aqueous ones unless i say this be said i see not how that absurdity will be avoyded whereunto the stoical notion of mistion namely by greek synchysis errata greek synchysis or confusion was liable according to which the least body may be coextended with the greatest since in a mixt body wherein before the elements were mingld there was for instance but one pound of water to ten thousand of earth yet according to them there must not be the least part of that compound that consisted not as well of earth as water but i insist perhaps too long sayes eleutherius upon the proofs afforded me by the nature of mistion wherefore i will but name two or three other arguments whereof the first shall be that according to aristotle himself the motion of a mixt body followes the nature of the predominant element as those wherein the earth prevails tend towards the centre of heavy bodies and since many things make it evident that in divers mixt bodies the elementary qualities are as well active though not altogether so much so as in the elements themselves it seems not reasonable to deny the actual existence of the elements in those bodies wherein they operate to which i shall add this convincing argument that experience manifests and aristotle confesses it that the miscibilia may be again separated from a mixt body as is obvious in the chymical resolutions of plants and animalls which could not be unless they did actually retain their formes in it for since according to aristotle and i think according to truth there is but one common mass of all things which he has been pleasd to call materia prima and since tis not therefore the matter but the forme that constitutes and discriminates things to say that the elements remain not in a mixt body according to their formes but according to their matter is not to say that they remain there at all since although those portions of matter were earth and water c before they concurrd yet the resulting body being once constituted may as well be said to be simple as any of the elements the matter being confessedly of the same nature in all bodies and the elementary formes being according to this hypothesis perishd and abolishd and lastly and if we will consult chymical experiments we shall find the advantages of the chymical doctrine above the peripatetick title little less then palpable for in that operation that refiners call quartation which they employ to purifie gold although three parts of silver be so exquisitely mingld by fusion with a fourth part of gold whence the operation is denominated that the resulting mass acquires severall new qualities by virtue of the composition and that there is scarce any sensible part of it that is not composd of both the metalls yet if you cast this mixture into aqua fortis the silver will be dissolvd in the menstruum and the gold like a dark or black powder will fall to the bottom of it and either body may be again reducd into such a metal as it was before which shews that it retaind its nature notwithstanding its being mixt per minima with the other we likewise see that though one part of pure silver be mingled with eight or ten parts or more of lead yet the fire will upon the cuppel easily and perfectly separate them again and that which i would have you peculiarly consider on this occasion is that not only in chymicall anatomies there is a separation made of the elementary ingredients but that some mixt bodies afford a very much greater quantity of this or that element or principle than of another as we see that turpentine and amber yield much more oyl and sulphur than they do water whereas wine which is confessd to be a perfectly mixt bodie yields but a little inflamable spirit or sulphur and not much more earth but affords a vast proportion of phlegm or water which could not be if as the peripateticks suppose every even of the minutest particles were of the same nature with the whole and consequently did contain both earth and water and aire and fire wherefore as to what aristotle principally and almost only objects that unless his opinion be admitted there would be no true and perfect mistion but onely aggregates or heaps of contiguous corpuscles which though the eye of man cannot discerne yet the eye of a lynx might perceive not to be of the same nature with one another and with their totum as the nature of mistion requires if he do not beg the question and make mistion to consist in what other naturalists deny to be requisite to it yet he at least objects that as a great inconvenience which i cannot take for such till he have brought as considerable arguments as i have proposd to prove the contrary to evince that nature makes other mistions than such as i have allowed wherein the miscibilia are reducd into minute parts and united as farr as sense can discerne which if you will not grant to be sufficient for a true mistion he must have the same quarrel with nature her self as with his adversaries wherefore continues eleutherius i cannot but somewhat marvail that carneades should oppose the doctrine of the chymist in a particular wherein they do as well agree with his old mistress nature as dissent from his old adversary aristotle i must not replies carneades engage my self at present to examine thorowly the controversies concerning mistion and if there were no third thing but that i were reducd to embrace absolutely and unreservedly either the opinion of aristotle or that of the philosophers that went before him i should look upon the latter which the chymists have adopted as the more defensible opinion but because differing in the opinions about the elements from both parties i think i can take a middle course and discourse to you of mistion after a way that does neither perfectly agree nor perfectly disagree with either as i will not peremptorily define whether there be not cases wherein some phnomena of mistion seem to favour the opinion that the chymists patrons borrowd of the antients i shall only endeavour to shew you that there are some cases which may keep the doubt which makes up my second general consideration from being unreasonable i shall then freely acknowledge to you sayes carneades that i am not over well satisfid with the doctrine that is ascribed to aristotle concerning mistion especially since it teaches that the four elements may again be separated from the mixt body whereas if they continud not in it it would not be so much a separation as a production and i think the ancient philosophers that preceded aristotle and chymists who have since receivd the same opinion do speak of this matter more intelligibly if not more probably then the peripateticks but though they speak congruously enough to their believing that there are a certain number of primogeneal bodies by whose concourse all those we call mixts are generated and which in the destruction of mixt bodies do barely part company and recede from one another just such as they were when they came together yet i who meet with very few opinions that i can entirely acquiesce in must confess to you that i am inclind to differ not only from the aristotelians but from the old philosophers and the chymists about the nature of mistion and if you will give me leave i shall briefly propose to you my present notion of it provided you will look upon it not so much as an assertion as an hypothesis in talking of which i do not now pretend to propose and debate the whole doctrine of mistion but to shew that tis not improbable that sometimes mingld substances may be so strictly united that it doth not by the usuall operations of the fire by which chymists are wont to suppose themselves to have made the analyses of mixt bodies sufficiently appear that in such bodies the miscibilia that concurrd to make them up do each of them retain its own peculiar nature and by the spagyrists fires may be more easily extricated and recoverd than alterd either by a change of texture in the parts of the same ingredient or by an association with some parts of another ingredient more strict than was that of the parts of this or that miscibile among themselves at these words eleu having pressd him to do what he proposd and promisd to do what he desird i consider then resumes carneades that not to mention those improper kinds of mistion wherein homogeneous bodies are joynd as when water is mingld with water or two vessels full of the same kind of wine with one another the mistion i am now to discourse of seems generally speaking to be but an union per minima of any two or more bodies of differing denominations as when ashes and sand are colliquated into glass or antimony and iron into regulus martis or wine and water are mingld and sugar is dissolvd in the mixture now in this general notion of mistion it does not appear clearly comprehended that the miscibilia or ingredients do in their small parts so retain their nature and remain distinct in the compound that they may thence by the fire be again taken asunder for though i deny not that in some mistions of certain permanent bodies this recovery of the same ingredients may be made yet i am not convincd that it will hold in all or even in most or that it is necessarily deducible from chymicall experiments and the true notion of mistion to explain this a little i assume that bodies may be mingld and that very durably that are not elementary or resolvd errata nor have been resolved into elements or principles that they may be mingld as is evident in the regulus of colliquated antimony and iron newly mentiond and in gold coyne which lasts so many ages wherein generally the gold is alloyd by the mixture of a quantity greater or lesser in our mints they use about a 12th part of either silver or copper or both next i consider that there being but one universal matter of things as tis known that the aristotelians themselves acknowledge who call it materia prima about which nevertheless i like not all their opinions the portions of this matter seem to differ from one another but in certain qualities or accidents fewer or more upon whose account the corporeal substance they belong to receives its denomination and is referrd to this or that particular sort of bodies so that if it come to lose or be deprivd of those qualities though it ceases not to be a body yet it ceases from being that kind of body as a plant or animal or red green sweet sowre or the like i consider that it very often happens that the small parts of bodies cohere together but by immediate contact and rest and that however there are few bodies whose minute parts stick so close together to what cause soever their combination be ascribd but that it is possible to meet with some other body whose small parts may get between them and so disjoyn them or may be fitted to cohere more strongly with some of them then those some do with the rest or at least may be combind so closely with them as that neither the fire nor the other usual instruments of chymical anatomies will separate them these things being promisd i will not peremptorily deny but that there may be some clusters of particles wherein the particles are so minute and the coherence so strict or both that when bodies of differing denominations and consisting of such durable clusters happen to be mingld though the compound body made up of them may be very differing from either of the ingredients yet each of the little masses or clusters may so retain its own nature as to be again separable such as it was before as when gold and silver being melted together in a due proportion for in every proportion the refiners will tell you that the experiment will not succeed aqua fortis will dissolve the silver and leave the gold untoucht by which means as you lately noted both the metalls may be recoverd from the mixed mass but continues carneades there are other clusters wherein the particles stick not so close together but that they may meet with corpuscles of another denomination which are disposd to be more closely united with some of them then they were among themselves and in such case two thus combining corpuscles losing that shape or size or motion or other accident upon whose account they were endowd with such a determinate quality or nature each of them really ceases to be a corpuscle of the same denomination it was before and from the coalition of these there may emerge a new body as really one as either of the corpuscles was before they were mingld or if you please confounded since this concretion is really endowd with its own distinct qualities and can no more by the fire or any other known way of analysis be divided again into the corpuscles that at first concurrd to make it than either of them could by the same means be subdivided into other particles but sayes eleutherius to make this more intelligible by particular examples if you dissolve copper in aqua fortis or spirit of nitre for i remember not which i usd nor do i think it much material you may by crystalizing the solution obtain a goodly vitriol which though by virtue of the composition it have manifestly diverse qualities not to be met with in either of the ingredients yet it seems that the nitrous spirits or at least many of them may in this compounded mass retain their former nature for having for tryal sake distilld this vitrioll spirit there came over store of red fumes which by that colour by their peculiar stinke and by their sourness manifested themselves to be nitrous spirits and that the remaining calx continud copper i suppose youl easily beleeve but if you dissolve minium which is but lead powderd by the fire in good spirit of vinager and crystalize the solution you shall not only have a saccharine salt exceedingly differing from both its ingredients but the union of some parts of the menstruum with some of those of the metal is so strict that the spirit of vinager seems to be as such destroyd since the saline corpuscles have quite lost that acidity upon whose account the liquor was calld spirit of vinager nor can any such acid parts as were put to the minium be separated by any known way from the saccharum saturni resulting from them both for not only there is no sowrness at all but an admirable sweetness to be tasted in the concretion and not only i found not that spirit of wine which otherwise will immediately hiss when mingld with strong spirit of vinager would hiss being pourd upon saccharum saturni wherein yet the acid salt of vinager did it survive may seem to be concentrated but upon the distillation of saccharum saturni by its self i found indeed a liquor very penetrant but not at all acid and differing as well in smell and other qualities as in tast from the spirit of vinager which likewise seemd to have left some of its parts very firmly united to the caput mortuum which though of a leaden nature was in smell colour c differing from minium which brings into my mind that though two powders the one blew and the other yellow may appear a green mixture without either of them losing its own colour as a good microscope has sometimes informd me yet having mingld minium and sal armoniack in a requisite proportion and exposd them in a glass vessel to the fire the whole mass became white and the red corpuscles were destroyd for though the calcind lead was separable from the salt yet youl easily beleeve it did not part from it in the forme of a red powder such as was the minium when it was put to the sal armoniack i leave it also to be considerd whether in blood and divers other bodies it be probable that each of the corpuscles that concurr to make a compound body doth though some of them in some cases may retain its own nature in it so that chymsts transcribers note chymists may extricate each sort of them from all the others wherewith it concurrd to make a body of one denomination i know there may be a distinction betwixt matter immanent when the material parts remain and retain their own nature in the things materiated as some of the schoolmen speak in which sence wood stones and lime are the matter of a house and transient which in the materiated thing is so alterd as to receive a new forme without being capable of readmitting again the old in which sence the friends of this distinction say that chyle is the matter of blood and blood that of a humane body of all whose parts tis presumd to be the aliment i know also that it may be said that of material principles some are common to all mixt bodies as aristotles four elements or the chymists tria prima others peculiar which belong to this or that sort of bodies as butter and a kind of whey may be said to be the proper principles of cream and i deny not but that these distinctions may in some cases be of use but partly by what i have said already and partly by what i am to say you may easily enough guess in what sence i admit them and discerne that in such a sence they will either illustrate some of my opinions or at least will not overthrow any of them to prosecute then what i was saying before i will add to this purpose that since the major part of chymists credit what those they call philosophers affirme of their stone i may represent to them that though when common gold and lead are mingled together the lead may be severd almost unalterd from the gold yet if instead of gold a tantillum of the red elixir be mingled with the saturn their union will be so indissoluble in the perfect gold that will be producd by it that there is no known nor perhaps no possible way of separating the diffusd elixir from the fixed lead but they both constitute a most permanent body wherein the saturne seems to have quite lost its properties that made it be calld lead and to have been rather transmuted by the elixir then barely associated to it so that it seems not alwayes necessary that the bodies that are put together per minima should each retain its own nature so as when the mass it self is dissipated by the fire to be more disposd to reappear in its pristine forme then in any new one which by a stricter association of its parts with those of some of the other ingredients of the compositum then with one another it may have acquired and if it be objected that unless the hypothesis i oppose be admitted in such cases as i have proposed there would not be an union but a destruction of mingled bodies which seems all one as to say that of such bodies there is no mistion at all i answer that though the substances that are mingld remain only their accidents are destroyd and though we may with tollerable congruity call them miscibilia because they are distinct bodies before they are put together however afterwards they are so confounded that i should rather call them concretions or resulting bodies than mixt ones and though perhaps some other and better account may be proposd upon which the name of mistion may remain yet if what i have said be thought reason i shall not wrangle about words though i think it fitter to alter a terme of art then reject a new truth because it suits not with it if it be also objected that this notion of mine concerning mixtion though it may be allowd when bodies already compounded are put to be mingld yet it is not applicable to those mixtions that are immediately made of the elements or principles themselves i answer in the first place that i here consider the nature of mixtion somewhat more generally then the chymists who yet cannot deny that there are oftentimes mixtures and those very durable ones made of bodies that are not elementary and in the next place that though it may be probably pretended that in those mixtures that are made immediately of the bodies that are calld principles or elements the mingld ingredients may better retain their own nature in the compounded mass and be more easily separated from thence yet besides that it may be doubted whether there be any such primary bodies i see not why the reason i alleadgd of the destructibility of the ingredients of bodies in general may not sometimes be applicable to salt sulphur or mercury till it be shewn upon what account we are to believe them priviledged and however if you please but to recall to mind to what purpose i told you at first i meant to speak of mistion at this time you will perhaps allow that what i have hitherto discoursed about it may not only give some light to the nature of it in general especially when i shall have an opportunity to declare to you my thoughts on that subject more fully but may on some occasions also be serviceable to me in the insuing part of this discourse but to look back now to that part of our discourse whence this excursion concerning mistion has so long diverted us though we there deducd from the differing substances obtained from a plant nourished only with water and from some other things that it was not necessary that nature should alwaies compound a body at first of all such differing bodies as the fire could afterwards make it afford yet this is not all that may be collected from those experiments for from them there seems also deducible something that subverts an other foundation of the chymical doctrine for since that as we have seen out of fair water alone not only spirit but oyle and salt and earth may be produced it will follow that salt and sulphur are not primogeneal bodies and principles since they are every day made out of plain water by the texture which the seed or seminal principle of plants puts it into and this would not perhaps seem so strange if through pride or negligence we were not wont to overlook the obvious and familiar workings of nature for if we consider what slight qualities they are that serve to denominate one of the tria prima we shall find that nature dos frequently enough work as great alterations in divers parcells of matter for to be readily dissoluble in water is enough to make the body that is so passe for a salt and yet i see not why from a new shufling and disposition of the component particles of a body it should be much harder for nature to compose a body dissoluble in water of a portion of water that was not so before then of the liquid substance of an egg which will easily mix with water to produce by the bare warmth of a hatching hen membrans feathers tendons and other parts that are not dissoluble in water as that liquid substance was nor is the hardness and brittleness of salt more difficult for nature to introduce into such a yielding body as water then it is for her to make the bones of a chick out of the tender substance of the liquors of an egg but instead of prosecuting this consideration as i easily might i will proceed as soon as i have taken notice of an objection that lies in my way for i easily foresee it will be alledged that the above mentioned examples are all taken from plants and animals in whom the matter is fashioned by the plastick power of the seed or something analogous thereunto whereas the fire dos not act like any of the seminal principles but destroyes them all when they come within its reach but to this i shall need at present to make but this easy answer that whether it be a seminal principle or any other which fashions that matter after those various manners i have mentioned to you yet tis evident that either by the plastick principle alone or that and heat together or by some other cause capable to contex the matter it is yet possible that the matter may be anew contrivd into such bodies and tis only for the possibility of this that i am now contending the sceptical chymist the third part what i have hitherto discoursd eleutherius sayes his friend to him has i presume shewn you that a considering man may very well question the truth of those very suppositions which chymists as well as peripateticks without proving take for granted and upon which depends the validity of the inferences they draw from their experiments wherefore having dispacht that which though a chymist perhaps will not yet i do look upon as the most important as well as difficult part of my task it will now be seasonable for me to proceed to the consideration of the experiments themselves wherein they are wont so much to triumph and glory and these will the rather deserve a serious examination because those that alledge them are wont to do it with so much confidence and ostentation that they have hitherto imposd upon almost all persons without excepting philosophers and physitians themselves who have read their books or heard them talk for some learned men have been content rather to beleeve what they so boldly affirm then be at the trouble and charge to try whether or no it be true others again who have curiosity enough to examine the truth of what is averrd want skill and opportunity to do what they desire and the generality even of learned men seeing the chymists not contenting themselves with the schools to amuse the world with empty words actually performd divers strange things and among those resolve compound bodies into several substances not known by former philosophers to be containd in them men i say seeing these things and hearing with what confidence chymists averr the substances obtaind from compound bodies by the fire to be the true elements or as they speak hypostaticall principles of them are forward to think it but just as well as modest that according to the logicians rule the skilfull artists should be credited in their own art especially when those things whose nature they so confidently take upon them to teach others are not only productions of their own skill but such as others know not else what to make of but though continues carneades the chymists have been able upon some or other of the mentiond acounts not only to delight but amaze and almost to bewitch even learned men yet such as you and i who are not unpractisd in the trade must not suffer our selves to be imposd upon by hard names or bold assertions nor to be dazld by that light which should but assist us to discern things the more clearly it is one thing to be able to help nature to produce things and another thing to understand well the nature of the things producd as we see that many persons that can beget children are for all that as ignorant of the number and nature of the parts especially the internal ones that constitute a childs body as they that never were parents nor do i doubt but youl excuse me if as i thank the chymists for the things their analysis shews me so i take the liberty to consider how many and what they are without being astonishd at them as if whosoever hath skill enough to shew men some new thing of his own making had the right to make them believe whatsoever he pleases to tell them concerning it wherefore i will now proceed to my third general consideration which is that it does not appear that three is precisely and universally the number of the distinct substances or elements whereinto mixt bodies are resoluble by the fire i mean that tis not provd by chymists that all the compound bodies which are granted to be perfectly mixt are upon their chymical analysis divisible each of them into just three distinct substances neither more nor less which are wont to be lookt upon as elementary or may as well be reputed so as those that are so reputed which last clause i subjoyne to prevent your objecting that some of the substances i may have occasion to mention by and by are not perfectly homogeneous nor consequently worthy of the name of principles for that which i am now to consider is into how many differing substances that may plausibly pass for the elementary ingredients of a mixd body it may be analyzd by the fire but whether each of these be uncompounded i reserve to examine when i shall come to the next general consideration where i hope to evince that the substances which the chymists not only allow but assert to be the component principles of the body resolvd into them are not wont to be uncompounded now there are two kind of arguments pursues carneades which may be brought to make my third proposition seem probable one sort of them being of a more speculative nature and the other drawn from experience to begin then with the first of these but as carneades was going to do as he had said eleutherius interrupted him by saying with a somewhat smiling countenance if you have no mind i should think that the proverb that good wits have bad memories is rational and applicable to you you must not forget now you are upon the speculative considerations that may relate to the number of the elements that your self did not long since deliver and concede some propositions in favour of the chymical doctrine which i may without disparagement to you think it uneasie even for carneades to answer i have not replies he forgot the concessions you mean but i hope too that you have not forgot neither with what cautions they were made when i had not yet assumed the person i am now sustaining but however i shall to content you so discourse of my third general consideration as to let you see that i am not unmindful of the things you would have me remember to talk then again according to such principles as i then made use of i shall represent that if it be granted rational to suppose as i then did that the elements consisted at first of certain small and primary coalitions of the minute particles of matter into corpuscles very numerous and very like each other it will not be absurd to conceive that such primary clusters may be of far more sorts then three or five and consequently that we need not suppose that in each of the compound bodies we are treating of there should be found just three sorts of such primitive coalitions as we are speaking of and if according to this notion we allow a considerable number of differing elements i may add that it seems very possible that to the constitution of one sort of mixt bodies two kinds of elementary ones may suffice as i lately exemplifyd to you in that most durable concrete glass another sort of mixts may be composd of three elements another of four another of five and another perhaps of many more so that according to this notion there can be no determinate number assignd as that of the elements of all sorts of compound bodies whatsoever it being very probable that some concretes consist of fewer some of more elements nay it does not seem impossible according to these principles but that there may be two sorts of mixts whereof the one may not have any of all the same elements as the other consists of as we oftentimes see two words whereof the one has not any one of the letters to be met with in the other or as we often meet with diverse electuaries in which no ingredient except sugar is common to any two of them i will not here debate whether there may not be a multitude of these corpuscles which by reason of their being primary and simple might be called elementary if several sorts of them should convene to compose any body which are as yet free and neither as yet contexd and entangld with primary corpuscles of other kinds but remains liable to be subdud and fashiond by seminal principles or the like powerful and transmuting agent by whom they may be so connected among themselves or with the parts of one of the bodies as to make the compound bodies whose ingredients they are resoluble into more or other elements then those that chymists have hitherto taken notice of to all which i may add that since it appears by what i observd to you of the permanency of gold and silver that even corpuscles that are not of an elementary but compounded nature may be of so durable a texture as to remain indissoluble in the ordinary analysis that chymists make of bodies by the fire tis not impossible but that though there were but three elements yet there may be a greater number of bodies which the wonted wayes of anatomy will not discover to be no elementary bodies but sayes carneades having thus far in compliance to you talkt conjecturally of the number of the elements tis now time to consider not of how many elements it is possible that nature may compound mixd bodies but at least as farr as the ordinary experiments of chymists will informe us of how many she doth make them up i say then that it does not by these sufficiently appear to me that there is any one determinate number of elements to be uniformly met with in all the several sorts of bodies allowd to be perfectly mixt and for the more distinct proof of this proposition i shall in the first place represent that there are divers bodies which i could never see by fire divided into so many as three elementary substances i would fain as i said lately to philoponus see that fixt and noble metal we call gold separated into salt sulphur and mercury and if any man will submit to a competent forfeiture in case of failing i shall willingly in case of prosperous successe pay both for the materials and the charges of such an experiment tis not that after what i have tryd my self i dare peremptorily deny that there may out of gold be extracted a certain substance which i cannot hinder chymists from calling its tincture or sulphur and which leaves the remaining body deprivd of its wonted colour nor am i sure that there cannot be drawn out of the same metal a real quick and running mercury but for the salt of gold i never could either see it or be satisfied that there was ever such a thing separated in rerum natura by the relation of any credible eye witnesse and for the several processes that promise that effect the materials that must be wrought upon are somewhat too pretious and costly to be wasted upon so groundlesse adventures of which not only the successe is doubtful but the very possibility is not yet demonstrated yet that which most deterres me from such tryalls is not their chargeablenesse but their unsatisfactorinesse though they should succeed for the extraction of this golden salt being in chymists processes prescribed to be effected by corrosive menstruums or the intervention of other saline bodies it will remain doubtful to a wary person whether the emergent salt be that of the gold it self or of the saline bodies or spirits employd to prepare it for that such disguises of metals do often impose upon artists i am sure eleutherius is not so much a stranger to chymistry as to ignore i would likewise willingly see the three principles separated from the pure sort of virginsand from osteocolla from refined silver from quicksilver freed from its adventitious sulphur from venetian talk transcribers note talck which by long detention in an extreme reverberium i could but divide into smaller particles not the constituent principles nay which when i caused it to be kept i know not how long in a glassehouse fire came out in the figure its lumps had when put in though alterd to an almost amethystine colour and from divers other bodies which it were now unnecessary to enumerate for though i dare not absolutely affirme it to be impossible to analyze these bodies into their tria prima yet because neither my own experiments nor any competent testimony hath hitherto either taught me how such an analysis may be made or satisfyd me that it hath been so i must take the liberty to refrain from believing it till the chymists prove it or give us intelligible and practicable processes to performe what they pretend for whilst they affect that nigmatical obscurity with which they are wont to puzzle the readers of their divulgd processes concerning the analyticall preparation of gold or mercury they leave wary persons much unsatisfyed whether or no the differing substances they promise to produce be truly the hypostatical principles or only some intermixtures of the divided bodies with those employd to work upon them as is evident in the seeming crystalls of silver and those of mercury which though by some inconsiderately supposed to be the salts of those metalls are plainly but mixtures of the metalline bodies with the saline parts of aqua fortis or other corrosive liquors as is evident by their being reducible into silver or quicksilver as they were before i cannot but confesse saith eleutherius that though chymists may upon probable grounds affirm themselves able to obtain their tria prima from animals and vegetables yet i have often wondred that they should so confidently pretend also to resolve all metalline and other mineral bodies into salt sulphur and mercury for tis a saying almost proverbial among those chymists themselves that are accounted philosophers and our famous countryman roger bacon has particularly adopted it that facilius est aurum facere quam destruere and i fear with you that gold is not the only mineral from which chymists are wont fruitlessly to attempt the separating of their three principles i know indeed continues eleutherius that the learned sennertus even in that book where he takes not upon him to play the advocate for the chymists but the umpier betwixt them and the peripateticks expresses himself roundly thus11 salem omnibus inesse mixtis scilicet ex iis fieri posse omnibus in resolutionibus chymicis versatis notissimum est and in the next page quod de sale dixi saies he idem de sulphure dici potest but by his favour i must see very good proofs before i believe such general assertions how boldly soever made and he that would convince me of their truth must first teach me some true and practicable way of separating salt and sulphur from gold silver and those many different sort of stones that a violent fire does not bring to lime but to fusion and not only i for my own part never saw any of those newly namd bodies so resolved but helmont who was much better versd in the chymical anatomizing of bodies then either sennertus or i has somewhere this resolute passage12 scio saies he ex arena silicibus saxis non calcariis nunquam sulphur aut mercurium trahi posse nay quercetanus himself though the grand stickler for the tria prima has this confession of the irresolubleness of diamonds13 adamas saith he omnium factus lapidum solidissimus ac durissimus ex arctissima videlicet trium principiorum unione ac cohrentia qu nulla arte separationis in solutionem principiorum suorum spiritualium disjungi potest and indeed pursues eleutherius i was not only glad but somewhat surprized to find you inclined to admit that there may be a sulphur and a running mercury drawn from gold for unlesse you do as your expression seemd to intimate take the word sulphur in a very loose sence i must doubt whether our chymists can separate a sulphur from gold for when i saw you make the experiment that i suppose invited you to speak as you did i did not judge the golden tincture to be the true principle of sulphur extracted from the body but an aggregate of some such highly colourd parts of the gold as a chymist would have called a sulphur incombustible which in plain english seems to be little better than to call it a sulphur and no sulphur and as for metalline mercuries i had not wondred at it though you had expressed much more severity in speaking of them for i remember that having once met an old and famous artist who had long been and still is chymist to a great monarch the repute he had of a very honest man invited me to desire him to tell me ingenuously whether or no among his many labours he had ever really extracted a true and running mercury out of metalls to which question he freely replyed that he had never separated a true mercury from any metal nor had ever seen it really done by any man else and though gold is of all metalls that whose mercury chymists have most endeavoured to extract and which they do the most brag they have extracted yet the experienced angelus sala in his spagyrical account of the seven terrestrial planets that is the seven metalls affords us this memorable testimony to our present purpose quanquam saies he c experientia tamen quam stultorum magistrum errata magistram vocamus certe comprobavit mercurium auri adeo fixum maturum arcte cum reliquis ejusdem corporis substantiis conjungi ut nullo modo retrogredi possit to which he subjoynes that he himself had seen much labour spent upon that design but could never see any such mercury producd thereby and i easily beleeve what he annexes that he had often seen detected many tricks and impostures of cheating alchymists for the most part of those that are fond of such charlatans being unskilfull or credulous or both tis very easie for such as have some skill much craft more boldness and no conscience to impose upon them and therefore though many professd alchymists and divers persons of quality have told me that they have made or seen the mercury of gold or of this or that other metal yet i have been still apt to fear that either these persons have had a design to deceive others or have not had skill and circumspection enough to keep themselves from being deceived footnote 11 sennert lib de cons dissens pag 147 footnote 12 helmon pag 409 footnote 13 quercet apud billich in thessalo redivivo pag 99 you recall to my mind sayes carneades a certain experiment i once devisd innocently to deceive some persons and let them and others see how little is to be built upon the affirmation of those that are either unskillfull or unwary when they tell us they have seen alchymists make the mercury of this or that metal and to make this the more evident i made my experiment much more slight short and simple than the chymists usuall processes to extract metalline mercuries which operations being commonly more elaborate and intricate and requiring a much more longer time give the alchymists a greater opportunity to cozen and consequently are more obnoxious to the spectators suspicion and that wherein i endeavourd to make my experiment look the more like a true analysis was that i not only pretended as well as others to extract a mercury from the metal i wrought upon but likewise to separate a large proportion of manifest and inflamable sulphur i take then of the filings of copper about a drachme or two of common sublimate powderd the like weight and sal armoniack near about as much as of sublimate these three being well mingld together i put into a small vial with a long neck or which i find better into a glass urinall which having first stopped it with cotton to avoid the noxious fumes i approach by degrees to a competent fire of well kindled coals or which looks better but more endangers the glass to the flame of a candle and after a while the bottom of the glass being held just upon the kindled coals or in the flame you may in about a quarter of an hour or perchance in halfe that time perceive in the bottom of the glass some running mercury and if then you take away the glass and break it you shall find a parcel of quicksilver perhaps altogether and perhaps part of it in the pores of the solid mass you shall find too that the remaining lump being held to the flame of the candle will readily burn with a greenish flame and after a little while perchance presently will in the air acquire a greenish blew which being the colour that is ascribd to copper when its body is unlocked tis easie to perswade men that this is the true sulphur of venus especially since not only the salts may be supposd partly to be flown away and partly to be sublimd to the upper part of the glass whose inside will commonly appear whitened by them but the metal seems to be quite destroyd the copper no longer appearing in a metalline forme but almost in that of a resinous lump whereas indeed the case is only this that the saline parts of the sublimate together with the sal armoniack being excited and actuated by the vehement heat fall upon the copper which is a metal they can more easily corrode than silver whereby the small parts of the mercury being freed from the salts that kept them asunder and being by the heat tumbled up and down after many occursions they convene into a conspicuous mass of liquor and as for the salts some of the more volatile of them subliming to the upper part of the glass the others corrode the copper and uniting themselves with it do strangely alter and disguise its metallick form and compose with it a new kind of concrete inflamable like sulphur concerning which i shall not now say any thing since i can referr you to the diligent observations which i remember mr boyle has made concerning this odde kind of verdigrease but continues carneades smiling you know i was not cut out for a mountebank and therefore i will hasten to resume the person of a sceptick and take up my discourse where you diverted me from prosecuting it in the next place then i consider that as there are some bodies which yield not so many as the three principles so there are many others that in their resolution exhibite more principles than three and that therefore the ternary number is not that of the universal and adequate principles of bodies if you allow of the discourse i ately errata lately made you touching the primary associations of the small particles of matter you will scarce think it improbable that of such elementary corpuscles there may be more sorts then either three or four or five and if you will grant what will scarce be denyd that corpuscles of a compounded nature may in all the wonted examples of chymists pass for elementary i see not why you should think it impossible that as aqua fortis or aqua regis will make a separation of colliquated silver and gold though the fire cannot so there may be some agent found out so subtile and so powerfull at least in respect of those particular compounded corpuscles as to be able to resolve them into those more simple ones whereof they consist and consequently encrease the number of the distinct substances whereinto the mixt body has been hitherto thought resoluble and if that be true which i recited to you a while ago out of helmont concerning the operations of the alkahest which divides bodies into other distinct substances both as to number and nature then the fire does it will not a little countenance my conjecture but confining our selves to such wayes of analyzing mixd bodies as are already not unknown to chymists it may without absurdity be questiond whether besides those grosser elements of bodies which they call salt sulphur and mercury there may not be ingredients of a more subtile nature which being extreamly little and not being in themselves visible may escape unheeded at the junctures of the destillatory vessels though never so carefully luted for let me observe to you one thing which though not taken notice of by chymists may be a notion of good use in divers cases to a naturalist that we may well suspect that there may be severall sorts of bodies which are not immediate objects of any one of our senses since we see that not only those little corpuscles that issue out of the loadstone and perform the wonders for which it is justly admired but the effluviums of amber jet and other electricall concretes though by their effects upon the particular bodies disposd to receive their action they seem to fall under the cognizance of our sight yet do they not as electrical immediately affect any of our senses as do the bodies whether minute or greater that we see feel taste c but continues carneades because you may expect i should as the chymists do consider only the sensible ingredients of mixt bodies let us now see what experience will even as to these suggest to us it seems then questionable enough whether from grapes variously orderd there may not be drawn more distinct substances by the help of the fire then from most other mixt bodies for the grapes themselves being dryed into raysins and distilld will besides alcali phlegm and earth yield a considerable quantity of an empyreumatical oyle and a spirit of a very different nature from that of wine also the unfermented juice of grapes affords other distild liquors then wine doth the juice of grapes after fermentation will yield a spiritus ardens which if competently rectifyed will all burn away without leaving any thing remaining the same fermented juice degenerating into vinager yields an acid and corroding spirit the same juice turnd errata tunned up armes it self with tartar out of which may be separated as out of other bodies phlegme spirit oyle salt and earth not to mention what substances may be drawn from the vine it self probably differing from those which are separated from tartar which is a body by it self that has few resemblers in the world and i will further consider that what force soever you will allow this instance to evince that there are some bodies that yield more elements then others it can scarce be denyd but that the major part of bodies that are divisible into elements yield more then three for besides those which the chymists are pleased to name hypostatical most bodies contain two others phlegme and earth which concurring as well as the rest to the constitution of mixts and being as generally if not more found in their analysis i see no sufficient cause why they should be excluded from the number of elements nor will it suffice to object as the paracelsians are wont to do that the tria prima are the most useful elements and the earth and water but worthlesse and unactive for elements being calld so in relation to the constituting of mixt bodies it should be upon the account of its ingrediency not of its use that any thing should be affirmed or denyed to be an element and as for the pretended uselessness of earth and water it would be considerd that usefulnesse or the want of it denotes only a respect or relation to us and therefore the presence or absence of it alters not the intrinsick nature of the thing the hurtful teeth of vipers are for ought i know useless to us and yet are not to be denyd to be parts of their bodies and it were hard to shew of what greater use to us then phlegme and earth are those undiscernd stars which our new telescopes discover to us in many blanched places of the sky and yet we cannot but acknowledge them constituent and considerably great parts of the universe besides that whether or no the phlegme and earth be immediately useful but necessary to constitute the body whence they are separated and consequently if the mixt body be not useless to us those constituent parts without which it could not have been that mixt body may be said not to be unuseful to us and though the earth and water be not so conspicuously operative after separation as the other three more active principles yet in this case it will not be amiss to remember the lucky fable of menemius aggrippa of the dangerous sedition of the hands and legs and other more busie parts of the body against the seemingly unactive stomack and to this case also we may not unfitly apply that reasoning of an apostle to another purpose if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were eye where were the hearing if the whole were for hearing where the smelling in a word since earth and water appear as clearly and as generally as the other principles upon the resolution of bodies to be the ingredients whereof they are made up and since they are useful if not immediately to us or rather to physitians to the bodies they constitute and so though in somewhat a remoter way are serviceable to us to exclude them out of the number of elements is not to imitate nature transcribers note see the printers note beginning the authors constant absence at the end of the book for material that the printer inadvertently omitted from this page but pursues carneades though i think it evident that earth and phlegme are to be reckond among the elements of most animal and vegetable bodies yet tis not upon that account alone that i think divers bodies resoluble into more substances then three for there are two experiments that i have sometimes made to shew that at least some mixts are divisible into more distinct substances then five the one of these experiments though twill be more seasonable for me to mention it fully anon yet in the mean time i shall tell you thus much of it that out of two distilld liquors which pass for elements of the bodies whence they are drawn i can without addition make a true yellow and inflamable sulphur notwithstanding that the two liquors remain afterwards distinct of the other experiment which perhaps will not be altogether unworthy your notice i must now give you this particular account i had long observd that by the destillation of divers woods both in ordinary and some unusuall sorts of vessels the copious spirit that came over had besides a strong tast to be met with in the empyreumaticall spirits of many other bodies an acidity almost like that of vinager wherefore i suspected that though the sowrish liquor distilld for instance from boxwood be lookt upon by chymists as barely the spirit of it and therefore as one single element or principle yet it does really consist of two differing substances and may be divisible into them and consequently that such woods and other mixts as abound with such a vinager may be said to consist of one element or principle more then the chymists as yet are aware of wherefore bethinking my self how the separation of these two spirits might be made i quickly found that there were several wayes of compassing it but that of them which i shall at present mention was this having destilld a quantity of boxwood per se and slowly rectifyd the sowrish spirit the better to free it both from oyle and phlegme i cast into this rectifyd liquor a convenient quantity of powderd coral expecting that the acid part of the liquor would corrode the coral and being associated with it would be so retaind by it that the other part of the liquor which was not of an acid nature nor fit to fasten upon the corals would be permitted to ascend alone nor was i deceivd in my expectation for having gently abstracted the liquor from the coralls there came over a spirit of a strong smell and of a tast very piercing but without any sourness and which was in diverse qualities manifestly different not only from a spirit of vinager but from some spirit of the same wood that i purposely kept by me without depriving it of its acid ingredient and to satisfy you that these two substances were of a very differing nature i might informe you of several tryals that i made but must not name some of them because i cannot do so without making some unseasonable discoveries yet this i shall tell you at present that the sowre spirit of box not only would as i just now related dissolve corals which the other would not fasten on but being pourd upon salt of tartar would immediately boile and hiss whereas the other would lye quietly upon it the acid spirit pourd upon minium made a sugar of lead which i did not find the other to do some drops of this penetrant spirit being mingld with some drops of the blew syrup of violets seemd rather to dilute then otherwise alter the colour whereas the acid spirit turnd the syrup of a reddish colour and would probably have made it of as pure a red as acid salts are wont to do had not its operation been hindered by the mixture of the other spirit a few drops of the compound spirit being shaken into a pretty quantity of the infusion of lignum nephriticum presently destroyed all the blewish colour whereas the other spirit would not take it away to all which it might be added that having for tryals sake pourd fair water upon the corals that remained in the bottom of the glass wherein i had rectifyed the double spirit if i may so call it that was first drawn from the box i found according to my expectation that the acid spirit had really dissolved the corals and had coagulated with them for by the affusion of fair water i obtaind a solution which to note that singularity upon the bye was red whence the water being evaporated there remained a soluble substance much like the ordinary salt of coral as chymists are pleasd to call that magistery of corals which they make by dissolving them in common spirit of vinager and abstracting the menstruum ad siccitatem i know not whether i should subjoine on this occasion that the simple spirit of box if chymists will have it therefore saline because it has a strong tast will furnish us with a new kind of saline bodies differing from those hitherto taken notice of for whereas of the three chief sorts of salts the acid the alcalizate and the sulphureous there is none that seems to be friends with both the other two as i may ere it be long have occasion to shew i did not find but that the simple spirit of box did agree very well at least as farr as i had occasion to try it both with the acid and the other salts for though it would lye very quiet with salt of tartar spirit of urine or other bodies whose salts were either of an alcalizate or fugitive nature yet did not the mingling of oyle of vitriol it self produce any hissing or effervescence which you know is wont to ensue upon the affusion of that highly acid liquor upon either of the bodies newly mentioned i think my self sayes eleutherius beholden to you for this experiment not only because i forsee you will make it helpful to you in the enquiry you are now upon but because it teaches us a method whereby we may prepare a numerous sort of new spirits which though more simple then any that are thought elementary are manifestly endowd with peculiar and powerfull qualities some of which may probably be of considerable use in physick as well alone as associated with other things as one may hopefully guess by the redness of that solution your sour spirit made of corals and by some other circumstances of your narrative and suppose pursues eleutherius that you are not so confind for the separation of the acid parts of these compound spirits from the other to employ corals but that you may as well make use of any alcalizate salt or of pearls or crabs eyes or any other body upon which common spirit of vinager will easily work and to speak in an helmontian phrase exantlate it self i have not yet tryed sayes carneades of what use the mentiond liquors may be in physick either as medicines or as menstruums but i could mention now and may another time divers of the tryals that i made to satisfy my self of the difference of these two liquors but that as i allow your thinking what you newly told me about corals i presume you will allow me from what i have said already to deduce this corollary that there are divers compound bodies which may be resolvd into four such differing substances as may as well merit the name of principles as those to which the chymists freely give it for since they scruple not to reckon that which i call the compound spirit of box for the spirit or as others would have it the mercury of that wood i see not why the acid liquor and the other should not each of them especially that last named be lookt upon as more worthy to be called an elementary principle since it must needs be of a more simple nature then the liquor which was found to be divisible into that and the acid spirit and this further use continues carneades may be made of our experiment to my present purpose that it may give us a rise to suspect that since a liquor reputed by the chymists to be without dispute homogeneous is by so slight a way divisible into two distinct and more simple ingredients some more skilful or happier experimenter then i may find a way either further to divide one of these spirits or to resolve some or other if not all of those other ingredients of mixt bodies that have hitherto passd among chymists for their elements or principles the sceptical chymist the fourth part and thus much sayes carneades may suffice to be said of the number of the distinct substances separable from mixt bodies by the fire wherefore i now proceed to consider the nature of them and shew you that though they seem homogeneous bodies yet have they not the purity and simplicity that is requisite to elements and i should immediately proceed to the proof of my assertion but that the confidence wherewith chymists are wont to call each of the substances we speak of by the name of sulphur or mercury or the other of the hypostaticall principles and the intollerabln errata intolerable ambiguity they allow themselves ie errata in their writings and expressions makes it necessary for me in order to the keeping you either from mistaking me or thinking i mistake the controversie to take notice to you and complain of the unreasonable liberty they give themselves of playing with names at pleasure and indeed if i were obligd in this dispute to have such regard to the phraseology of each particular chymist as not to write any thing which this or that author may not pretend not to contradict this or that sence which he may give as occasion serves to his ambiguous expressions i should scarce know how to dispute nor which way to turn myself for i find that even eminent writers such as raymund lully paracelsus and others do so abuse the termes they employ that as they will now and then give divers things one name so they will oftentimes give one thing many names and some of them perhaps such as do much more properly signifie some distinct body of another kind nay even in technical words or termes of art they refrain not from this confounding liberty but will as i have observd call the same substance sometimes the sulphur and sometimes the mercury of a body and now i speak of mercury i cannot but take notice that the descriptions they give us of that principle or ingredient of mixt bodies are so intricate that even those that have endeavourd to pollish and illustrate the notions of the chymists are fain to confess that they know not what to make of it either by ingenuous acknowledgments or descriptions that are not intelligible i must confess sayes eleutherius i have in the reading of paracelsus and other chymical authors been troubled to find that such hard words and equivocal expressions as you justly complain of do even when they treat of principles seem to be studiously affected by those writers whether to make themselves to be admird by their readers and their art appear more venerable and mysterious or as they would have us think to conceal from them a knowledge themselves judge inestimable but whatever sayes carneades these men may promise themselves from a canting way of delivering the principles of nature they will find the major part of knowing men so vain as when they understand not what they read to conclude that it is rather the writers fault then their own and those that are so ambitious to be admird by the vulgar that rather then go without the admiration of the ignorant they will expose themselves to the contempt of the learned those shall by my consent freely enjoy their option as for the mystical writers scrupling to communicate their knowledge they might less to their own disparagement and to the trouble of their readers have conceald it by writing no books then by writing bad ones if themistius were here he would not stick to say that chymists write thus darkly not because they think their notions too precious to be explaind but because they fear that if they were explaind men would discern that they are farr from being precious and indeed i fear that the chief reason why chymists have written so obscurely of their three principles may be that not having clear and distinct notions of them themselves they cannot write otherwise then confusedly of what they but confusedly apprehend not to say that divers of them being conscious to the invalidity of their doctrine might well enough discerne that they could scarce keep themselves from being confuted but by keeping themselves from being clearly understood but though much may be said to excuse the chymists when they write darkly and nigmatically about the preparation of their elixir and some few other grand arcana the divulging of which they may upon grounds plausible enough esteem unfit yet when they pretend to teach the general principles of natural philosophers this equivocall way of writing is not to be endurd for in such speculative enquiries where the naked knowledge of the truth is the thing principally aimd at what does he teach me worth thanks that does not if he can make his notion intelligible to me but by mystical termes and ambiguous phrases darkens what he should clear up and makes me add the trouble of guessing at the sence of what he equivocally expresses to that of examining the truth of what he seems to deliver and if the matter of the philosophers stone and the manner of preparing it be such mysteries as they would have the world believe them they may write intelligibly and clearly of the principles of mixt bodies in general without discovering what they call the great work but for my part continues carneades what my indignation at this unphilosophical way of teaching principles has now extorted from me is meant chiefly to excuse my self if i shall hereafter oppose any particular opinion or assertion that some follower of paracelsus or any eminent artist may pretend not to be his masters for as i told you long since i am not obligd to examine private mens writings which were a labour as endless as unprofitable being only engagd to examine those opinions about the tria prima which i find those chymists i have met with to agree in most and i doubt not but my arguments against their doctrine will be in great part easily enough applicable evn to those private opinions which they do not so directly and expresly oppose and indeed that which i am now entering upon being the consideration of the things themselves whereinto spagyrists resolve mixt bodies by the fire if i can shew that these are not of an elementary nature it will be no great matter what names these or those chymists have been pleased to give them and i question not that to a wise man and consequently to eleutherius it will be lesse considerable to know what men have thought of things then what they should have thought in the fourth and last place then i consider that as generally as chymists are wont to appeal to experience and as confidently as they use to instance the several substances separated by the fire from a mixt body as a sufficient proof of their being its component elements yet those differing substances are many of them farr enough from elementary simplicity and may be yet lookd upon as mixt bodies most of them also retaining somewhat at least if not very much of the nature of those concretes whence they were forcd i am glad sayes eleutherius to see the vanity or envy of the canting chymists thus discoverd and chastisd and i could wish that learned men would conspire together to make these deluding writers sensible that they must no longe transcribers note longer hope with impunity to abuse the world for whilst such men are quietly permitted to publish books with promising titles and therein to assert what they please and contradict others and evn themselves as they please with as little danger of being confuted as of being understood they are encouragd to get themselves a name at the cost of the readers by finding that intelligent men are wont for the reason newly mentiond to let their books and them alone and the ignorant and credulous of which the number is still much greater then that of the other are forward to admire most what they least understand but if judicious men skilld in chymical affaires shall once agree to write clearly and plainly of them and thereby keep men from being stunnd as it were or imposd upon by dark or empty words tis to be hopd that these men finding that they can no longer write impertinently and absurdly without being laughd at for doing so will be reducd either to write nothing or books that may teach us something and not rob men as formerly of invaluable time and so ceasing to trouble the world with riddles or impertinencies we shall either by their books receive an advantage or by their silence escape an inconvenience but after all this is said continues eleutherius it may be represented in favour of the chymists that in one regard the liberty they take in using names if it be excusable at any time may be more so when they speak of the substances whereinto their analysis resolves mixt bodies since as parents have the right to name their own children it has ever been allowd to the authors of new inventions to impose names upon them and therefore the subjects we speak of being so the productions of the chymists art as not to be otherwise but by it obtainable it seems but equitable to give the artists leave to name them as they please considering also that none are so fit and likely to teach us what those bodies are as they to whom we owd them i told you already sayes carneades that there is great difference betwixt the being able to make experiments and the being able to give a philosophical account of them and i will not now add that many a minedigger may meet whilst he follows his work with a gemm or a mineral which he knowes not what to make of till he shews it a jeweller or a mineralist to be informd what it is but that which i would rather have here observd is that the chymists i am now in debate with have given up the liberty you challengd for them of using names at pleasure and confind themselves by their descriptions though but such as they are of their principles so that although they might freely have calld any thing their analysis presents them with either sulphur or mercury or gas or blas or what they pleasd yet when they have told me that sulphur for instance is a primogeneal and simple body inflamable odorous c they must give me leave to disbelieve them if they tell me that a body that is either compounded or uninflamable is such a sulphur and to think they play with words when they teach that gold and some other minerals abound with an incombustible sulphur which is as proper an expression as a sunshine night or fluid ice but before i descend to the mention of particulars belonging to my fourth consideration i think it convenient to premise a few generals some of which i shall the less need to insist on at present because i have touched on them already and first i must invite you to take notice of a certain passage in helmont14 which though i have not found much heeded by his readers he himself mentions as a notable thing and i take to be a very considerable one for whereas the distilld oyle of oyleolive though drawn per se is as i have tryd of a very sharp and fretting quality and of an odious tast he tells us that simple oyle being only digested with paracelsuss sal circulatum is reducd into dissimilar parts and yields a sweet oyle very differing from the oyle distilld from errata distilld from sallet oyle as also that by the same way there may be separated from wine a very sweet and gentle spirit partaking of a far other and nobler quality then that which is immediately drawn by distillation and calld dephlegmd aqua vit from whose acrimony this other spirit is exceedingly remote although the sal circulatum that makes these anatomies be separated from the analyzd bodies in the same weight and with the same qualities it had before which affirmation of helmont if we admit to be true we must acknowledge that there may be a very great disparity betwixt bodies of the same denomination as several oyles or several spirits separable from compound bodies for besides the differences i shall anon take notice of betwixt those distilld oyles that are commonly known to chymists it appears by this that by means of the sal circulatum there may be quite another sort of oyles obtaind from the same body and who knowes but that there may be yet other agents found in nature by whose help there may whether by transmutation or otherwise be obtaind from the bodies vulgarly calld mixt oyles or other substances differing from those of the same denomination known either to vulgar chymists or even to helmont himself but for fear you should tell me that this is but a conjecture grounded upon another mans relation whose truth we have not the means to experiment i will not insist upon it but leaving you to consider of it at leasure i shall proceed to what is next footnote 14 illud notabile in vino esse spiritum quendam mitiorem ulterioris nobilioris qualitatis participem qua qui immediat per distillationem elicitur diciturque aqua vit dephlegmata quod facilius in simplici olivarum oleo ad oculum spectatur quippe distillatum oleum absque laterum aut tigularum errata

prout suavissimus vini spiritus a vino hoc pacto separantur longque ab aqu vit acrimoni distinctushelmont aura vitalis pag 725 secondly then if that be true which was the opinion of lucippus democritus and other prime anatomists of old and is in our dayes revivd by no mean philosophers namely that our culinary fire such as chymists use consists of swarmes of little bodies swiftly moving which by their smallness and motion are able to permeate the sollidest and compactest bodies and even glass it self if this i say be true since we see that in flints and other concretes the fiery part is incorporated with the grosser it will not be irrationall to conjecture that multitudes of these fiery corpuscles getting in at the pores of the glass may associate themselves with the parts of the mixt body whereon they work and with them constitute new kinds of compound bodies according as the shape size and other affections of the parts of the dissipated body happen to dispose them in reference to such combinations of which also there may be the greater number if it be likewise granted that the corpuscles of the fire though all exceeding minute and very swiftly moved are not all of the same bigness nor figure and if i had not weightier considerations to discourse to you of i could name to you to countenance what i have newly said some particular experiments by which i have been deducd to think that the particles of an open fire working upon some bodies may really associate themselves therewith and add to the quantity but because i am not so sure that when the fire works upon bodies included in glasses it does it by a reall trajection of the fiery corpuscles themselves through the substance of the glass i will proceed to what is next to be mentiond i could sayes eleutherius help you to some proofes whereby i think it may be made very probable that when the fire acts immediately upon a body some of its corpuscles may stick to those of the burnt body as they seem to do in quicklime but in greater numbers and more permanently but for fear of retarding your progress i shall desire you to deferr this enquiry till another time and proceed as you intended you may then in the next place sayes carneades observe with me that not only there are some bodies as gold and silver which do not by the usual examens made by fire discover themselves to be mixt but if as you may remember i formerly told you it be a decompound body that is dissipable into several substances by being exposd to the fire it may be resolvd into such as are neither elementary nor such as it was upon its last mixture compounded of but into new kinds of mixts of this i have already given you some examples in sope sugar of lead and vitrioll now if we shall consider that there are some bodies as well natural as that i last namd as factitious manifestly decompounded that in the bowells of the earth nature may as we see she sometimes does make strange mixtures that animals are nourishd with other animals and plants and that these themselves have almost all of them their nutriment and growth either from a certain nitrous juice harbourd in the pores of the earth or from the excrements of animalls or from the putrifyd bodies either of living creatures or vegetables or from other substances of a compounded nature if i say we consider this it may seem probable that there may be among the works of nature not to mention those of art a greater number of decompound bodies then men take notice of and indeed as i have formerly also observd it does not at all appear that all mixtures must be of elementary bodies but it seems farr more probable that there are divers sorts of compound bodies even in regard of all or some of their ingredients considerd antecedently to their mixture for though some seem to be made up by the immediate coalitions of the elements or principles themselves and therefore may be calld prima mista or mista primaria yet it seems that many other bodies are mingld if i may so speak at the second hand their immediate ingredients being not elementary but these primary mixts newly spoken of and from divers of these secondary sort of mixts may result by a further composition a third sort and so onwards nor is it improbable that some bodies are made up of mixt bodies not all of the same order but of several as for instance a concrete may consist of ingredients whereof the one may have been a primary the other a secondary mixt body as i have in native cinnaber by my way of resolving it found both that courser the errata delete the part that seems more properly to be oar and a combustible sulphur and a running mercury or perhaps without any ingredient of this latter sort it may be composd of mixt bodies some of them of the first and some of the third kind and this may perhaps be somewhat illustrated by reflecting upon what happens in some chymical preparations of those medicines which they call their bezoardicums for first they take antimony and iron which may be lookd upon as prima mista of these they compound a starry regulus and to this they add according to their intention either gold or silver which makes with it a new and further composition to this they add sublimate which is it self a decompound body consisting of common quicksilver and divers salts united by sublimation into a crystalline substance and from this sublimate and the other metalline mixtures they draw a liquor which may be allowd to be of a yet more compounded nature if it be true as chymists affirm it that by this art some of the gold or silver mingld with the regulus may be carryd over the helme with it by the sublimate as indeed a skilfull and candid person complaind to me a while since that an experiencd friend of his and mine having by such a way brought over a great deal of gold in hope to do something further with it which might be gainfull to him has not only missd of his aim but is unable to recover his volatilizd gold out of the antimonial butter wherewith it is strictly united now continues carneades if a compound body consist of ingredients that are not meerly elementary it is not hard to conceive that the substances into which the fire dissolves it though seemingly homogeneous enough may be of a compounded nature those parts of each body that are most of kin associating themselves into a compound of a new kind as when for example sake i have causd vitrioll and sal armoniack and salt petre to be mingld and destilld together the liquor that came over manifested it self not to be either spirit of nitre or of sal armoniack or of vitrioll for none of these would dissolve crude gold which yet my liquor was able readily to do and thereby manifested it self to be a new compound consisting at least of spirit of nitre and sal armoniack for the latter dissolvd in the former will work on gold which nevertheless are not by any known way separable and consequently would not pass for a mixt body if we our selves did not to obtain it put and distill together divers concretes whose distinct operations were known before hand and to add on this occasion the experiment i lately promisd you because it is applicable to our present purpose i shall acquaint you that suspecting the common oyle of vitrioll not to be altogether such a simple liquor as chymists presume it i mingld it with an equal or a double quantity for i tryd the experiment more then once of common oyle of turpentine such as together with the other liquor i bought at the drugsters and having carefully for the experiment is nice and somewhat dangerous distilld the mixture in a small glass retort i obtaind according to my desire besides the two liquors i had put in a pretty quantity of a certain substance which sticking all about the neck of the retort discoverd it self to be sulphur not only by a very strong sulphureous smell and by the colour of brimstone but also by this that being put upon a coal it was immediately kindld and burnd like common sulphur and of this substance i have yet by me some little parcells which you may command and examine when you please so that from this experiment i may deduce either one or both of these propositions that a real sulphur may be made by the conjunction of two such substances as chymists take for elementary and which did not either of them apart appear to have any such body in it or that oyle of vitrioll though a distilld liquor and taken for part of the saline principle of the concrete that yields it may yet be so compounded a body as to contain besides its saline part a sulphur like common brimstone which would hardly be it self a simple or uncompounded body i might pursues carneades remind you that i formerly represented it as possible that as there may be more elements then five or six so the elements of one body may be different from those of another whence it would follow that from the resolution of decompound body errata bodies there may result mixts of an altogether new kind by the coalition of elements that never perhaps convend before i might i say mind you of this and add divers things to this second consideration but for fear of wanting time i willingly pretermit them to pass on to the third which is this that the fire does not alwayes barely resolve or take asunder but may also after a new manner mingle and compound together the parts whether elementary or not of the body dissipated by it this is so evident sayes carneades in some obvious examples that i cannot but wonder at their supiness that have not taken notice of it for when wood being burnt in a chimney is dissipated by the fire into smoke and ashes that smoke composes soot which is so far from being any one of the principles of the wood that as i noted above you may by a further analysis separate five or six distinct substances from it and as for the remaining ashes the chymists themselves teach us that by a further degree of fire they may be indissolubly united into glass tis true that the analysis which the chymists principally build upon is made not in the open air but in close vessels but however the examples lately producd may invite you shrewdly to suspect that heat may as well compound as dissipate the parts of mixt bodies and not to tell you that i have known a vitrification made even in close vessels i must remind you that the flowers of antimony and those of sulphur are very mixd bodies though they ascend in close vessells and that twas in stopt glasses that i brought up the whole body of camphire and whereas it may be objected that all these examples are of bodies forcd up in a dry not a fluid forme as are the liquors wont to be obtaind by distillation i answer that besides that tis possible that a body may be changd from consistent to fluid or from fluid to consistent without being otherwise much altered as may appear by the easiness wherewith in winter without any addition or separation of visible ingredients the same substance may be quickly hardend into brittle ice and thawd again into fluid water besides this i say it would be considerd that common quicksilver it self which the eminentest chymists confess to be a mixt body may be driven over the helme in its pristine forme of quicksilver and consequently in that of a liquor and certainly tis possible that very compounded bodies may concur to constitute liquors since not to mention that i have found it possible by the help of a certain menstruum to distill gold it self through a retort even with a moderate fire let us but consider what happens in butter of antimony for if that be carefully rectifyd it may be reducd into a very clear liquor and yet if you cast a quantity of fair water upon it there will quickly precipitate a ponderous and vomitive calx which made before a considerable part of the liquor and yet is indeed though some eminent chymists would have it mercurial an antimonial body carryed over and kept dissolvd by the salts of the sublimate and consequently a compounded one as you may find if you will have the curiosity to examine this white powder by a skilful reduction and that you may not think that bodies as compounded as flowers of brimstone cannot be brought to concurr to constitute distilld liquors and also that you may not imagine with divers learned men that pretend no small skill in chymistry that at least no mixt body can be brought over the helme but by corrosive salts i am ready to shew you when you please among other wayes of bringing over flowers of brimstone perhaps i might add even mineral sulphurs some wherein i employ none but oleaginous bodies to make volatile liquors in which not only the colour but which is a much surer mark the smell and some operations manifest that there is brought over a sulphur that makes part of the liquor one thing more there is eleutherius sayes carneades which is so pertinent to my present purpose that though i have touchd upon it before i cannot but on this occasion take notice of it and it is this that the qualities or accidents upon whose account chymists are wont to call a portion of matter by the name of mercury or some other of their principles are not such but that tis possible as great and therefore why not the like may be producd by such changes of texture and other alterations as the fire may make in the small parts of a body i have already provd when i discoursd of the second general consideration by what happens to plants nourishd only with fair water and eggs hatchd into chickens that by changing the disposition of the component parts of a body nature is able to effect as great changes in a parcell of matter reputed similar as those requisite to denominate one of the tria prima and though helmont do somewhere wittily call the fire the destructor and the artificial death of things and although another eminent chymist and physitian be pleasd to build upon this that fire can never generate any thing but fire yet you will i doubt not be of another mind if you consider how many new sorts of mixt bodies chymists themselves have producd by means of the fire and particularly if you consider how that noble and permanent body glass is not only manifestly producd by the violent action of the fire but has never for ought we know been producd any other way and indeed it seems but an inconsiderate assertion of some helmontians that every sort of body of a peculiar denomination must be producd by some seminal power as i think i could evince if i thought it so necessary as it is for me to hasten to what i have further to discourse nor need it much move us that there are some who look upon whatsoever the fire is employd to produce not as upon natural but artificial bodies for there is not alwaies such a difference as many imagine betwixt the one and the other nor is it so easy as they think clearly to assigne that which properly constantly and sufficiently discriminates them but not to engage my self in so nice a disquisition it may now suffice to observe that a thing is commonly termed artificial when a parcel of matter is by the artificers hand or tools or both brought to such a shape or form as he designd beforehand in his mind whereas in many of the chymical productions the effect would be producd whether the artificer intended it or no and is oftentimes very much other then he intended or lookt for and the instruments employd are not tools artificially fashiond and shaped like those of tradesmen for this or that particular work but for the most part agents of natures own providing and whose chief powers of operation they receive from their own nature or texture not the artificer and indeed the fire is as well a natural agent as seed and the chymist that imployes it does but apply natural agents and patients who being thus brought together and acting according to their respective natures performe the worke themselves as apples plums or other fruit are natural productions though the gardiner bring and fasten together the sciens of the stock and both water and do perhaps divers other wayes contribute to its bearing fruit but to proceed to what i was going to say you may observe with me eleutherius that as i told you once before qualities sleight enough may serve to denominate a chymical principle for when they anatomize a compound body by the fire if they get a substance inflamable and that will not mingle with water that they presently call sulphur what is sapid and dissoluble in water that must pass for salt whatsoever is fixd and indissoluble in water that they name earth and i was going to add that whatsoever volatile substance they know not what to make of not to say whatsoever they please that they call mercury but that these qualities may either be producd otherwise then by such as they call seminal agents or may belong to bodies of a compounded nature may be shewn among other instances in glass made of ashes where the exceeding stronglytasted alcalizate salt joyning with the earth becomes insipid and with it constitutes a body which though also dry fixt and indissoluble in water is yet manifestly a mixt body and made so by the fire itself and i remmember to our present purpose that helmont15 amongst other medicines that he commends has a short processe wherein though the directions for practice are but obscurely intimated yet i have some reason not to disbelieve the process without affirming or denying any thing about the vertues of the remedy to be made by it quando sayes he oleum cinnamomi c suo sali alkali miscetur absque omni aqua trium mensium artificiosa occultaque circulatione totum in salem volatilem commutatum est vere essentiam sui simplicis in nobis exprimit usque in prima nostri constitutivasese ingerit a not unlike processe he delivers in another place from whence if we suppose him to say true i may argue that since by the fire there may be producd a substance that is as well saline and volatile as the salt of hartshorn blood c which pass for elementary and since that this volatile salt is really compounded of a chymical oyle and a fixt salt the one made volatile by the other and both associated by the fire it may well be suspected that other substances emerging upon the dissipation of bodies by the fire may be new sorts of mixts and consist of substances of differing natures and particularly i have sometimes suspected that since the volatile salts of blood hartshorn c are figitive errata fugitive and endowd with an exceeding strong smell either that chymists do erroneously ascribe all odours to sulphurs or that such salts consist of some oyly parts well incorporated with the saline ones and the like conjecture i have also made concerning spirit of vinager which though the chymists think one of the principles of that body and though being an acid spirit it seems to be much less of kin then volatile salts to sulphurs yet not to mention its piercing smell which i know not with what congruity the chymist will deduce from salt i wonder they have not taken notice of what their own tyrocinium chymicum teach us concerning the destillation of saccharum saturni out of which beguinus16 assures us that he distilld besides a very fine spirit no lesse then two oyles the one bloodred and ponderous but the other swimming upon the top of the spirit and of a yellow colour of which he sayes that he kept then some by him to verify what he delivers and though i remember not that i have had two distinct oyles from sugar of lead yet that it will though distilld without addition yield some oyle disagrees not with my experience i know the chymists will be apt to pretend that these oyls are but the volatilizd sulphur of the lead and will perhaps argue it from what beguinus relates that when the distillation is ended youl find a caput mortuum extreamly black and as he speaks nullius momenti as if the body or at least the chief part of the metal it self were by the distillation carried over the helme but since you know as well as i that saccharum saturni is a kind of magistery made only by calcining of lead per se dissolving it in distilld vinager and crystalizing the solution if i had leasure to tell you how differing a thing i did upon examination find the caput mortuum so sleighted by beguinus to be from what he represents it i believe you would think the conjecture proposd less probable then one or other of these three either that this oyle did formerly concur to constitute the spirit of vinager and so that what passes for a chymical principle may yet be further resoluble into distinct substances or that some parts of the spirit together with some parts of the lead may constitute a chymical oyle which therefore though it pass for homogeneous may be a very compounded body or at least that by the action of the distilld vinager and the saturnine calx one upon another part of the liquor may be so alterd as to be transmuted from an acid spirit into an oyle and though the truth of either of the two former conjectures would make the example i have reflected on more pertinent to my present argument yet youl easily discern the third and last conjecture cannot be unserviceable to confirm some other passages of my discourse footnote 15 helmont pag 412 footnote 16 tyroc chym l 1 c 4 to return then to what i was saying just before i mentiond helmonts experiment i shall subjoyne that chymists must confess also that in the perfectly dephlegmd spirit of wine or other fermented liquors that which they call the sulphur of the concrete loses by the fermentation the property of oyle which the chymists likewise take to be the true sulphur of the mixt of being unminglable with the water and if you will credit helmont17 all errata a pound of the purest spirit of wine may barely by the help of pure salt of tartar which is but the fixed salt of wine be resolvd or transmuted into scarce half an ounce of salt and as much elementary water as amounts to the remaining part of the mentiond weight and it may as i think i formerly also noted be doubted whether that fixt and alcalizate salt which is so unanimously agreed on to be the saline principle of incinerated bodies be not as tis alcalizate a production of the fire for though the tast of tartar for example seem to argue that it contains a salt before it be burnd yet that salt being very acid is of a quite differing tast from the lixiviate salt of calcind tartar and though it be not truly objected against the chymists that they obtain all salts they make by reducing the body they work on into ashes with violent fires since hartshorn amber blood and divers other mixts yield a copious salt before they be burnd to ashes yet this volatile salt differs much as we shall see anon from the fixt alcalizate salt i speak of which for ought i remember is not producible by any known way without incineration tis not unknown to chymists that quicksilver may be precipitated without addition into a dry powder that remains so in water and some eminent spagyrists and even raimund lully himself teach that meerly by the fire quicksilver may in convenient vessels be reducd at least in great part into a thin liquor like water and minglable with it so that by the bare action of the fire tis possible that the parts of a mixt body should be so disposd after new and differing manners that it may be sometimes of one consistence sometimes of another and may in one state be disposd to be mingld with water and in another not i could also shew you that bodies from which apart chymists cannot obtain any thing that is combustible may by being associated together and by the help of the fire afford an inflamable substance and that on the other side tis possible for a body to be inflamable from which it would very much puzzle any ordinary chymist and perhaps any other to separate an inflamable principle or ingredient wherefore since the principles of chymists may receive their denominations from qualities which it often exceeds not the power of art nor alwayes that of the fire to produce and since such qualities may be found in bodies that differ so much in other qualities from one another that they need not be allowd to agree in that pure and simple nature which principles to be so indeed must have it may justly be suspected that many productions of the fire that are shewd us by chymists as the principles of the concrete that afforded them may be but a new kind of mixts and to annex on this occasion to these arguments taken from the nature of the thing one of those which logicians call ad hominem i shall desire you to take notice that though paracelsus himself and some that are so mistaken as to think he could not be so have venturd to teach that not only the bodies here below but the elements themselves and all the other parts of the universe are composd of salt sulphur and mercury yet the learned sennertus and all the more wary chymists have rejected that conceit and do many of them confess that the tria prima are each of them made up of the four elements and others of them make earth and water concur with salt sulphur and mercury to the constitution of mixt bodies so that one sort of these spagyrists notwithstanding the specious titles they give to the productions of the fire do in effect grant what i contend for and of the other sort i may well demand to what kind of bodies the phlegme and dead earth to be met with in chymical resolutions are to be referrd for either they must say with paracelsus but against their own concessions as well as against experience that these are also composd of the tria prima whereof they cannot separate any one from either of them or else they must confess that two of the vastest bodies here below earth and water are neither of them composd of the tria prima and that consequently those three are not the universal and adequate ingredients neither of all sublunary bodies nor even of all mixt bodies footnote 17 ostendi alias quomodo lib una aqu vit combibita in sale tartari siccato vix fiat semuncia salis cterum totum corpus fiat aqua elementalis helmont in aura vitali i know that the chief of these chymists represent that though the distinct substances into which they divide mixt bodies by the fire are not pure and homogeneous yet since the four elements into which the aristotelians pretend to resolve the like bodies by the same agent are not simple neither as themselves acknowledge tis as allowable for the chymists to call the one principles as for the peripateticks to call the other elements since in both cases the imposition of the name is grounded only upon the predominancy of that element whose name is ascribd to it nor shall i deny that this argument of the chymists is no ill one against the aristotelians but what answer can it prove to me who you know am disputing against the aristotelian elements as the chymicall principles and must not look upon any body as a true principle or element but as yet compounded which is not perfectly homogeneous but is further resoluble into any number of distinct substances how small soever and as for the chymists calling a body salt or sulphur or mercury upon pretence that the principle of the same name is predominant in it that it self is an acknowledgment of what i contend for namely that these productions of the fire are yet compounded bodies and yet whilst this is granted it is affirmd but not provd that the reputed salt or sulphur or mercury consists mainly of one body that deserves the name of a principle of the same denomination for how do chymists make it appear that there are any such primitive and simple bodies in those we are speaking of since tis upon the matter confessd by the answer lately made that these are not such and if they pretend by reason to evince what they affirm what becomes of their confident boasts that the chymists errata chymist whom they therefore after beguinus call a philosophus or opifex sensatus can convince our eyes by manifestly shewing in any mixt body those simple substances he teaches them to be composd of and indeed for the chymists to have recourse in this case to other proofs then experiments as it is to wave the grand argument that has all this while been given out for a demonstrative one so it releases me from the obligation to prosecute a dispute wherein i am not engagd to examine any but experimentall proofs i know it may plausibly enough be represented in favour of the chymists that it being evident that much the greater part of any thing they call salt or sulphur or mercury is really such it would be very rigid to deny those substances the names ascribed them only because of some sleight mixture of another body since not only the peripateticks call particular parcels of matter elementary though they acknowledge that elements are not to be anywhere found pure at least here below and since especially there is a manifest analogie and resemblance betwixt the bodies obtainable by chymical anatomies and the principles whose names are given them i have i say considerd that these things may be represented but as for what is drawn from the custome of the peripateticks i have already told you that though it may be employd against them yet it is not available against me who allow nothing to be an element that is not perfectly homogeneous and whereas it is alledgd that the predominant principle ought to give a name to the substance wherein it abounds i answer that that might much more reasonably be said if either we or the chymists had seen nature take pure salt pure sulphur and pure mercury and compound of them every sort of mixt bodies but since tis to experience that they appeal we must not take it for granted that the distilld oyle for instance of a plant is mainly composd of the pure principle calld sulphur till they have given us an ocular proof that there is in that sort of plants such an homogeneous sulphur for as for the specious argument which is drawn from the resemblance betwixt the productions of the fire and the respective either aristotelian elements or chymical principles by whose names they are calld it will appear more plausible then cogent if you will but recall to mind the state of the controversie which is not whether or no there be obtaind from mixt bodies certain substances that agree in outward appearance or in some qualities with quicksilver or brimstone or some such obvious or copious body but whether or no all bodies confessd to be perfectly mixt were composd of and are resoluble into a determinate number of primary unmixt bodies for if you keep the state of the question in your eye youl easily discerne that there is much of what should be demonstrated left unprovd by those chymical experiments we are examining but not to repeat what i have already discoverd more at large i shall now take notice that it will not presently follow that because a production of the fire has some affinity with some of the greater masses of matter here below that therefore they are both of the same nature and deserve the same name for the chymists are not content that flame should be lookt upon as a parcel of the element of fire though it be hot dry and active because it wants some other qualities belonging to the nature of elementary fire nor will they let the peripateticks call ashes or quicklime earth notwithstanding the many likenesses between them because they are not tastlesse as elementary earth ought to be but if you should ask me what then it is that all the chymical anatomies of bodies do prove if they prove not that they consist of the three principles into which the fire resolves them i answer that their dissections may be granted to prove that some mixt bodies for in many it will not hold are by the fire when they are included in close vessels for that condition also is often requisite dissolube transcribers note dissoluble into several substances differing in some qualities but principally in consistence so that out of most of them may be obtaind a fixt substance partly saline and partly insipid an unctuous liquor and another liquor or more that without being unctuous have a manifest taste now if chymists will agree to call the dry and sapid substance salt the unctous liquor sulphur and the other mercury i shall not much quarrel with them for so doing but if they will tell me that salt sulphur and mercury are simple and primary bodies whereof each mixt body was actually compounded and which was really in it antecedently to the operation of the fire they must give me leave to doubt whether whatever their other arguments may do their experiments prove all this and if they will also tell me that the substances their anatomies are wont to afford them are pure and similar as principles ought to be they must give me leave to believe my own senses and their own confessions before their bare assertions and that you may not eleutherius think i deal so rigidly with them because i scruple to take these productions of the fire for such as the chymists would have them pass for upon the account of their having some affinity with them consider a little with me that in regard an element or principle ought to be perfectly similar and homogeneous there is no just cause why i should rather give the body proposd the name of this or that element or principle because it has a resemblance to it in some obvious quality rather then deny it that name upon the account of divers other qualities wherein the proposd bodies are unlike and if you do but consider what sleight and easily producible qualities they are that suffice as i have already more then once observd to denominate a chymical principle or an element youl not i hope think my wariness to be destitute either of example or else of reason for we see that the chymists will not allow the aristotelians that the salt in ashes ought to be called earth though the saline and terrestrial part symbolize in weight in dryness in fixness and fusibility only because the one is sapid and dissoluble in water and the other not besides we see that sapidness and volatility are wont to denominate the chymists mercury or spirit and yet how many bodies think you may agree in those qualities which may yet be of very differing natures and disagree in qualities either more numerous or more considerable or both for not only spirit of nitre aqua fortis spirit of salt spirit of oyle of vitriol spirit of allome spirit of vinager and all saline liquors distilld from animal bodies but all the acetous spirits of woods freed from their vinager all these i say and many others must belong to the chymists mercury though it appear not why some of them should more be comprehended under one denomination then the chymists sulphur or oyle should likewise be for their distilld oyles are also fluid volatile and tastable as well as their mercury nor is it necessary that their sulphur should be unctuous or dissoluble in water since they generally referr spirit of wine to sulphurs although that spirit be not unctuous and will freely mingle with water so that bare inflamability must constitute the essence of the chymists sulphur as uninflamablenesse joyned with any taste is enough to intitle a distilld liquor to be their mercury now since i can further observe to you that spirit of nitre and spirit of hartshorne being pourd together will boile and hisse and tosse up one another into the air which the chymists make signes of great antipathy in the natures of bodies as indeed these spirits differ much both in taste smell and operations since i elsewhere tell you of my having made two sorts of oyle out of the same mans blood that would not mingle with one another and since i might tell you divers examples i have met with of the contrariety of bodies which according to the chymists must be huddld up together under one denomination i leave you to judge whether such a multitude of substances as may agree in these sleight qualities and yet disagree in others more considerable are more worthy to be calld by the name of a principle which ought to be pure and homogeneous than to have appellations given them that may make them differ in name too from the bodies from which they so wildly differ in nature and hence also by the bye you may perceive that tis not unreasonable to distrust the chymists way of argumentation when being unable to shew us that such a liquor is for example purely saline they prove that at least salt is much the predominant principle because that the proposd substance is strongly tasted and all tast proceeds from salt whereas those spirits such as spirit of tartar spirit of hartshorn and the like which are reckoned to be the mercuries of the bodies that afford them have manifestly a strong and piercing tast and so has according to what i formerly noted the spirit of box c even after the acid liquor that concurrd to compose it has been separated from it and indeed if sapidness belong not to the spirit or mercurial principle of vegitables and animals i scarce know how it will be discriminated from their phlegm since by the absence of inflamability it must be distinguishd from their sulphur which affords me another example to prove how unacurate the chymical doctrine is in our present case since not only the spirits of vegitables and animals but their oyles are very strongly tasted as he that shall but wet his tongue with chymical oyle of cinnamon or of cloves or even of turpentine may quickly find to his smart and not only i never tryd any chymical oyles whose tast was not very manifest and strong but a skilful and inquisitive person who made it his business by elaborate operations to depurate chymical oyles and reduce them to an elementary simplicity informes us that he never was able to make them at all tastless whence i might inferr that the proof chymists confidently give us of a bodies being saline is so far from demonstrating the predominancy that it does not clearly evince so much as the presence of the saline principle in it but i will not pursues carneades remind you that the volatile salt of hartshorn amber blood c are exceeding strongly scented notwithstanding that most chymists deduce odours from sulphur and from them argue the predominancy of that principle in the odorous body because i must not so much as add any new examples of the incompetency of this sort of chymical arguments since having already detaind you but too long in those generals that appertain to my fourth consideration tis time that i proceed to the particulars themselves to which i thought fit they should be previous these generals continues carneades being thus premisd we might the better survey the unlikeness that an attentive and unprepossessd observer may take notice of in each sort of bodies which the chymists are wont to call the salts or sulphurs or mercuries of the concretes that yield them as if they had all a simplicity and identity of nature whereas salts if they were all elementary would as little differ as do the drops of pure and simple water tis known that both chymists and physitians ascribe to the fixt salts of calcind bodies the vertues of their concretes and consequently very differing operations so we find the alkali of wormwood much commended in distempers of the stomach that of eyebright for those that have a weak sight and that of guaiacum of which a great quantity yields but a very little salt is not only much commended in venereal diseases but is believed to have a peculiar purgative vertue which yet i have not had occasion to try and though i confess i have long thought that these alkalizate salts are for the most part very neer of kin and retain very little of the properties of the concretes whence they were separated yet being minded to observe watchfully whether i could meet with any exceptions to this general observation i observd at the glassehouse that sometimes the metal as the workmen call it or masse of colliquated ingredients which by blowing they fashion into vessels of divers shapes did sometimes prove of a very differing colour and a somewhat differing texture from what was usuall and having enquired whether the cause of such accidents might not be derived from the peculiar nature of the fixt salt employd to bring the sand to fusion i found that the knowingst workmen imputed these misadventures to the ashes of errata ashes off some certain kind of wood as having observd the ignobler kind of glass i lately mentiond to be frequently producd when they had employd such sorts of ashes which therefore they scruple to make use of if they took notice of them beforehand i remember also that an industrious man of my acquaintance having bought a vast quantity of tobacco stalks to make a fixt salt with i had the curiosity to go see whether that exotick plant which so much abounds in volatile salt would afford a peculiar kind of alcali and i was pleasd to find that in the lixivium of it it was not necessary as is usual to evaporate all the liquor that there might be obtaind a saline calx consisting like lime quenchd in the air of a heap of little corpuscles of unregarded shapes but the fixt salt shot into figurd crystal almost as nitre or salarmoniack and other uncalcind salts are wont to do and i further remember that i have observd in the fixt salt of urine brought by depuration to be very white a tast not so unlike to that of common salt and very differing from the wonted caustick lixiviate tast of other salts made by incineration but because the instances i have alledgd of the difference of alcalizate salt are but few and therefore i am still inclind to think that most chymists and many physitians do inconsideratly enough and without warrant from experience ascribe the vertues of the concretes exposd to calcination to the salts obtaind by it i shall rather to shew the disparity of salts mention in the first place the apparent difference betwixt the vegetable fixt salts and the animal volatile ones as for example betwixt salt of tartar and salt of hartshorn whereof the former is so fixt that twill indure the brunt of a violent fire and stand in fusion like a metal whereas the other besides that it has a differing tast and a very differing smell is so far from being fixt that it will fly away in a gentle heat as easily as spirit of wine it self and to this i shall add in the next place that even among the volatile salts themselves there is a considerable difference as appears by the distinct properties of for instance salt of amber salt of urine salt of mans skull so much extolld against the falling sicknesse and divers others which cannot escape an ordinary observer and this diversity of volatile salts i have observd to be somtimes discernable even to the eye in their figures for the salt of hartshorn i have observd to adhere to the receiver in the forme almost of a parallelipipedon and of the volatile salt of humane blood long digested before distillation with spirit of wine i can shew you store of graines of that figure which geometricians call a rhombus though i dare not undertake that the figures of these or other saline crystals if i may so call them will be alwaies the same whatever degree of fire have been employd to force them up or how hastily soever they have been made to convene in the spirits or liquors in the lower part of which i have usually observd them after a while to shoot and although as i lately told you i seldom found any difference as to medical vertues in the fixt salts of divers vegetables and accordingly i have suspected that most of these volatile salts having so great a resemblance in smell in tast and fugitiveness differ but little if at all in their medicinal properties as indeed i have found them generally to agree in divers of them as in their being somewhat diaphoretick and very deopilative errata deopilative yet i remember helmont18 somewhere informes us that there is this difference betwixt the saline spirit of urine and that of mans blood that the former will not cure the epilepsy but the latter will of the efficacy also of the salt of common amber against the same disease in children for in grown persons it is not a specifick i may elsewhere have an occasion to entertain you and when i consider that to the obtaining of these volatile salts especially that of urine there is not requisite such a destructive violence of the fire as there is to get those salts that must be made by incineration i am the more invited to conclude that they may differ from one another and consequently recede from an elementary simplicity and if i could here shew you what mr boyle has observd touching the various chymicall distinctions of salts you would quickly discern not only that chymists do give themselves a strange liberty to call concretes salts that are according to their own rules to be lookd upon as very compounded bodies but that among those very salts that seem elementary because producd upon the anatomy of the bodies that yield them there is not only a visible disparity but to speak in the common language a manifest antipathy or contrariety as is evident in the ebullition and hissing that is wont to ensue when the acid spirit of vitrioll for instance is pourd upon pot ashes or salt of tartar and i shall beg leave of this gentleman sayes carneades casting his eyes on me to let me observe to you out of some of his papers particularly those wherein he treats of some preparations of urine that not only one and the same body may have two salts of a contrary nature as he exemplifies in the spirit and alkali of nitre but that from the same body there may without addition be obtaind three differing and visible salts for he relates that he observd in urine not only a volatile and crystalline salt and a fixt salt but likewise a kind of sal armoniack or such a salt as would sublime in the form of a salt and therefore was not fixt and yet was far from being so fugitive as the volatile salt from which it seemd also otherwise to differ i have indeed suspected that this may be a sal armoniack properly enough so calld as compounded of the volatile salt of urine and the fixt of the same liquor which as i noted is not unlike seasalt but that it self argues a manifest difference betwixt the salts since such a volatile salt is not wont to unite thus with an ordinary alcali but to fly away from it in the heat and on this occasion i remember that to give some of my friends an ocular proof of the difference betwixt the fixt and volatile salt of the same concrete wood i devisd the following experiment i took common venetian sublimate and dissolvd as much of it as i well could in fair water then i took wood ashes and pouring on them warme water dissolvd their salt and filtrating the water as soon as i found the lixivium sufficiently sharp upon the tongue i reservd it for use then on part of the former solution of sublimate dropping a little of this dissolvd fixt salt of wood the liquors presently turnd of an orange colour but upon the other part of the clear solution of sublimate putting some of the volatile salt of wood which abounds in the spirit of soot the liquor immediately turnd white almost like milke and after a while let fall a white sediment as the other liquor did a yellow one to all this that i have said concerning the difference of salts i might add what i formerly told you concerning the simple spirit of box and such like woods which differ much from the other salts hitherto mentiond and yet would belong to the saline principle if chymists did truly teach that all tasts proceed from it and i might also annex what i noted to you out of helmont19 concerning bodies which though they consist in great part of chymical oyles do yet appear but volatile salts but to insist on these things were to repeat and therefore i shall proceed footnote 18 error vero per distillationem nobis monstrat etiam spiritum salinum plane volatilem odore nequicquam ut nec gustu distinguibilem a spiritu urin in eo tamen essentialiter diversum quod spiritus talis cruoris curat epilepsiam non autem spiritus salis lotii helmont aura vitalis footnote 19 aliquando oleum cinnamomi c suo sali alcali miscetur absque omni aqua trium mensium artificiosa occultaque circulatione totum in salem volatilem commutatum est helmont tria prima chymicorum c pag 412 this disparity is also highly eminent in the separated sulphurs or chymical oyles of things for they contain so much of the scent and tast and vertues of the bodies whence they were drawn that they seem to be but the material crasis if i may so speak of their concretes thus the oyles of cinnamon cloves nutmegs and other spices seem to be but the united aromatick parts that did ennoble those bodies and tis a known thing that oyl of cinnamon and oyle of cloves which i have likewise observd in the oyles of several woods will sink to the bottom of water whereas those of nutmegs and divers other vegetables will swim upon it the oyle abusively calld spirit of roses swims at the top of the water in the forme of a white butter which i remember not to have observd in any other oyle drawn in any limbeck yet there is a way not here to be declard by which i have seen it come over in the forme of other aromatick oyles to the delight and wonder of those that beheld it in oyle of anniseeds which i drew both with and without fermentation i observd the whole body of the oyle in a coole place to thicken into the consistence and appearance of white butter which with the least heat resumd its former liquidness in the oyl of olive drawn over in a retort i have likewise more then once seen a spontaneous coagulation in the receiver and i have of it by me thus congeald which is of such a strangely penetrating scent as if twould perforate the noses that approach it the like pungent odour i also observd in the distilld liquor of common sope which forcd over from minium lately afforded an oyle of a most admirable penetrancy and he must be a great stranger both to the writings and preparations of chymists that sees not in the oyles they distill from vegetables and animals a considerable and obvious difference nay i shall venture to add eleutherius what perhaps you will think of kin to a paradox that divers times out of the same animal or vegetable there may be extracted oyles of natures obviously differing to which purpose i shall not insist on the swimming and sinking oyles which i have sometimes observd to float on and subside under the spirit of guajacum and that of divers other vegetables distilld with a strong and lasting fire nor shall i insist on the observation elsewhere mentiond of the divers and unminglable oyles afforded us by humane blood long fermented and digested with spirit of wine because these kind of oyles may seem chiefly to differ in consistence and weight being all of them high colourd and adust but the experiment which i devisd to make out this difference of the oyles of the same vegetable ad oculum as they speak was this that followes i took a pound of annisseeds and having grosly beaten them caused them to be put into a very large glass retort almost filled with fair water and placing this retort in a sand furnace i causd a very gentle heat to be administerd during the first day and a great part of the second till the water was for the most part drawn off and had brought over with it at least most of the volatile and aromatick oyle of the seeds and then encreasing the fire and changing the receiver i obtaind besides an empyreumatical spirit a quantity of adust oyle whereof a little floated upon the spirit and the rest was more heavy and not easily separable from it and whereas these oyles were very dark and smelld as chymists speak so strongly of the fire that their odour did not betray from what vegetables they had been forcd the other aromatick oyle was enrichd with the genuine smell and tast of the concrete and spontaneously coagulating it self into white butter did manifest self errata it self to be the true oyle of annisseeds which concrete i therefore chose to employ about this experiment that the difference of these oyles might be more conspicuous then it would have been had i instead of it destilld another vegetable i had almost forgot to take notice that there is another sort of bodies which though not obtaind from concretes by distillation many chymists are wont to call their sulphur not only because such substances are for the most part high colourd whence they are also and that more properly called tinctures as dissolvd sulphurs are wont to be but especially because they are for the most part abstracted and separated from the rest of the masse by spirit of wine which liquor those men supposing to be sulphureous they conclude that what it works upon and abstracts must be a sulphur also and upon this account they presume that they can sequester the sulphur even of minerals and metalls from which tis known that they cannot by fire alone separate it to all this i shall answer that if these sequestred substances where indeed the sulphurs of the bodies whence they are drawn there would as well be a great disparity betwixt chymical sulphurs obtaind by spirit of wine as i have already shewn there is betwixt those obtaind by distillation in the forme of oyles which will be evident from hence that not to urge that themselves ascribe distinct vertues to mineral tinctures extolling the tincture of gold against such and such diseases the tincture of antimony or of its glass against others and the tincture of emerauld against others tis plain that in tinctures drawn from vegetables if the superfluous spirit of wine be distilld off it leaves at the bottom that thicker substance which chymists use to call the extract of the vegetable and that these extracts are endowd with very differing qualities according to the nature of the particular bodies that afforded them though i fear seldom with so much of the specifick vertues as is wont to be imagind is freely confessd both by physitians and chymists but eleutherius sayes carneades we may here take notice that the chymists do as well in this case as in many others allow themselves a license to abuse words for not again to argue from the differing properties of tinctures that they are not exactly pure and elementary sulphurs they would easily appear not to be so much as sulphurs although we should allow chymical oyles to deserve that name for however in some mineral tinctures the natural fixtness of the extracted body does not alwayes suffer it to be easily further resoluble into differing substances yet in very many extracts drawn from vegetables it may very easily be manifested that the spirit of wine has not sequestred the sulphureous ingredient from the saline and mercurial ones but has dissolvd for i take it to be a solution the finer parts of the concrete without making any nice distinction of their being perfectly sulphureous or not and united it self with them into a kind of magistery which consequently must contain ingredients or parts of several sorts for we see that the stones that are rich in vitriol being often drenchd with rainwater the liquor will then extract a fine and transparent substance coagulable into vitriol and yet though this vitriol be readily dissoluble in water it is not a true elementary salt but as you know a body resoluble into very differing parts whereof one as i shall have occasion to tell you anon is yet of a metalline and consequently not of an elementary nature you may consider also that common sulphur is readily dissoluble in oyle of turpentine though notwithstanding its name it abounds as well if not as much in salt as in true sulphur witness the great quantity of saline liquor it affords being set to flame away under a glasse bell nay i have which perhaps you will think strange with the same oyle of turpentine alone easily enough dissolvd crude antimony finely powderd into a bloodred balsam wherewith perhaps considerable things may be performd in surgery and if it were now requisite i could tell you of some other bodies such as perhaps you would not suspect that i have been able to work upon with certain chymical oyles but instead of digressing further i shall make this use of the example i have namd that tis not unlikely but that spirit of wine which by its pungent tast and by some other qualities that argue it better especially its reduciblenesse according to helmont into alcali and water seems to be as well of a saline as of a sulphureous nature may well be supposd capable of dissolving substances that are not meerly elementary sulphurs though perhaps they may abound with parts that are of kin thereunto for i find that spirit of wine will dissolve gumm lacca benzoine and the resinous parts of jallap and even of guaiacum whence we may well suspect that it may from spices herbs and other lesse compacted vegetables extract substances that are not perfect sulphurs but mixt bodies and to put it past dispute there is many a vulgar extract drawn with spirit of wine which committed to distillation will afford such differing substances as will loudly proclaim it to have been a very compounded body so that we may justly suspect that even in mineral tinctures it will not alwaies follow that because a red substance is drawn from the concrete by spirit of wine that substance is its true and elementary sulphur and though some of these extracts may perhaps be inflamable yet besides that others are not and besides that their being reducd to such minuteness of parts may much facilitate their taking fire besides this i say we see that common sulphur common oyle gumm lac and many unctuous and resinous bodies will flame well enough though they be of very compounded natures nay travellers of unsuspected credit assure us as a known thing that in some northern countries where firr trees and pines abound the poorer sort of inhabitants use long splinters of those resinous woods to burne instead of candles and as for the rednesse wont to be met with in such solutions i could easily shew that tis not necessary it should proceed from the sulphur of the concrete dissolvd by the spirit of wine if i had leasure to manifest how much chymists are wont to delude themselves and others by the ignorance of those other causes upon whose account spirit of wine and other menstruums may acquire a red or some other high colour but to returne to our chymical oyles supposing that they were exactly pure yet i hope they would be as the best spirit of wine is but the more inflamable and deflagrable and therefore since an oyle can be by the fire alone immediately turnd into flame which is something of a very differing nature from it i shall demand how this oyle can be a primogeneal and incorruptible body as most chymists would have their principles since it is further resoluble into flame which whether or no it be a portion of the element of fire as an aristotelian would conclude is certainly something of a very differing nature from a chymical oyle since it burnes and shines and mounts swiftly upwards none of which a chymical oyle does whilst it continues such and if it should be objected that the dissipated parts of this flaming oyle may be caught and collected again into oyl or sulphur i shall demand what chymist appears to have ever done it and without examining whether it may not hence be as well said that sulphur is but compacted fire as that fire is but diffusd sulphur i shall leave you to consider whether it may not hence be argud that neither fire nor sulphur are primitive and indestructible bodies and i shall further observe that at least it will hence appear that a portion of matter may without being compounded with new ingredients by having the texture and motion of its small parts changd be easily by the means of the fire endowd with new qualities more differing from them it had before then are those which suffice to discriminate the chymists principles from one another we are next to consider whether in the anatomy of mixt bodies that which chymists call the mercurial part of them be uncompounded or no but to tell you true though chymists do unanimously affirm that their resolutions discover a principle which they call mercury yet i find them to give of it descriptions so differing and so nigmaticall that i who am not ashamd to confess that i cannot understand what is not sence must acknowledge to you that i know not what to make of them paracelsus himself and therefore as you will easily believe many of his followers does somewhere call that mercury which ascends upon the burning of wood as the peripateticks are wont to take the same smoke for air and so seems to define mercury by volatility or if i may coyne such a word effumability but since in this example both volatile salt and sulphur make part of the smoke which does indeed consist also both of phlegmatick and terrene corpuscles this notion is not to be admitted and i find that the more sober chymists themselves disavow it yet to shew you how little of clearness we are to expect in the accounts even of latter spagyrists be pleasd to take notice that beguinus even in his tyrocinium chymicum20 written for the instruction of novices when he comes to tell us what are meant by the tria prima which for their being principles ought to be defind the more accurately and plainly gives us this description of mercury mercurius sayes he est liquor ille acidus permeabilis penetrabilis thereus ac purissimus a quo omnis nutricatio sensus motus vires colores senectutisque prproper retardatio which words are not so much a definition of it as an encomium and yet quercetanus in his description of the same principle adds to these divers other epithets but both of them to skip very many other faults that may be found with their metaphoricall descriptions speak incongruously to the chymists own principles for if mercury be an acid liquor either hermetical philosophy must err in ascribing all tasts to salt or else mercury must not be a principle but compounded of a saline ingredient and somewhat else libavius though he find great fault with the obscurity of what the chymists write concerning their mercurial principle does yet but give us such a negative description of it as sennertus how favourable soever to the tria prima is not satisfid with and this sennertus himself though the learnedst champion for the hypostatical principles does almost as frequently as justly complain of the unsatisfactoriness of what the chymists teach concerning their mercury and yet he himself but with his wonted modesty substitutes instead of the description of libavius another which many readers especially if they be not peripateticks will not know what to make of for scarce telling us any more then that in all bodies that which is found besides salt and sulphur and the elements or as they call them phlegm and dead earth is that spirit which in aristotles language may be calld greek ousian analogon errata ousia analogos t tn astrn stoichai errata astrn stoichei he sayes that which i confess is not at all satisfactory to me who do not love to seem to acquiesce in any mans mystical doctrines that i may be thought to understand them footnote 20 chm tyrocin lib 1 cap 2 if sayes eleutherius i durst presume that the same thing would be thought clear by me and those that are fond of such cloudy expressions as you justly tax the chymists for i should venture to offer to consideration whether or no since the mercurial principle that arises from distillation is unanimously asserted to be distinct from the salt and sulphur of the same concrete that may not be calld the mercury of a body which though it ascend in distillation as do the phlegme and sulphur is neither insipid like the former nor inflamable like the latter and therefore i would substitute to the too much abused name of mercury the more clear and familiar appellation of spirit which is also now very much made use of even by the chymists themselves of our times though they have not given us so distinct an explication as were fit of what may be calld the spirit of a mixt body i should not perhaps sayes carneades much quarrel with your notion of mercury but as for the chymists what they can mean with congruity to their own principles by the mercury of animals and vegetables twill not be so easie to find out for they ascribe tasts only to the saline principle and consequently would be much put to it to shew what liquor it is in the resolution of bodies that not being insipid for that they call phlegme neither is inflamable as oyle or sulphur nor has any tast which according to them must proceed from a mixture at least of salt and if we should take spirit in the sence of the word receivd among modern chymists and physitians for any distilld liquor that is neither phlegme nor oyle the appellation would yet appear ambiguous enough for plainly that which first ascends in the distillation of wine and fermented liquors is generally as well by chymists as others reputed a spirit and yet pure spirit of wine being wholly inflamable ought according to them to be reckond to the sulphureous not the mercurial principle and among the other liquors that go under the name of spirits there are divers which seem to belong to the family of salts such as are the spirits of nitre vitriol seasalt and others and even the spirit of hartshorn being as i have tryd in great part if not totally reducible into salt and phlegme may be suspected to be but a volatile salt disguisd by the phlegme mingld with it into the forme of a liquor however if this be a spirit it manifestly differs very much from that of vinager the tast of the one being acid and the other salt and their mixture in case they be very pure sometimes occasioning an effervescence like that of those liquors the chymists count most contrary to one another and even among those liquors that seem to have a better title then those hitherto mentiond to the name of spirits there appears a sensible diversity for spirit of oak for instance differs from that of tartar and this from that of box or of guaiacum and in short even these spirits as well as other distilld liquors manifest a great disparity betwixt themselves either in their actions on our senses or in their other operations and continues carneades besides this disparity that is to be met with among those liquors that the modernes call spirits take for similar bodies what i have formerly told you concerning the spirit of boxwood may let you see that some of those liquors not only have qualities very differing from others but may be further resolved into substances differing from one another and since many moderne chymists and other naturalists are pleased to take the mercurial spirit of bodies for the same principle under differing names i must invite you to observe with me the great difference that is conspicuous betwixt all the vegetable and animal spirits i have mentiond and running mercury i speak not of that which is commonly sold in shops that many of themselves will confesse to be a mixt body but of that which is separated from metals which by some chymists that seem more philosophers then the rest and especially by the above mentioned claveus is for distinction sake called mercurius corporum now this metalline liquor being one of those three principles of which mineral bodies are by spagyrists affirmed to be composd and to be resoluble into them the many notorious differences betwixt them and the mercuries as they call them of vegetables and animals will allow me to inferr either that minerals and the other two sorts of mixt bodies consist not of the same elements or that those principles whereinto minerals are immediately resolved which chymists with great ostentation shew us as the true principles of them are but secundary principles or mixts of a peculiar sort which must be themselves reducd to a very differing forme to be of the same kind with vegetable and animal liquors but this is not all for although i formerly told you how little credit there is to be given to the chymical processes commonly to be met with of extracting the mercuries of metals yet i will now add that supposing that the more judicious of them do not untruly affirme that they have really drawn true and running mercury from several metals which i wish they had cleerly taught us how to do also yet it may be still doubted whether such extracted mercuries do not as well differ from common quicksilver and from one another as from the mercuries of vegetables and animalls claveus21 in his apology speaking of some experiments whereby metalline mercuries may be fixt into the nobler metals adds that he spake of the mercuries drawn from metals because common quicksilver by reason of its excessive coldnesse and moisture is unfit for that particular kind of operation for which though a few lines before he prescribes in general the mercuries of metalline bodies yet he chiefly commends that drawn by art from silver and elsewhere in the same book he tells us that he himself tryed that by bare coction the quicksilver of tin or pewter argentum vivum ex stanno prolicitum may by an efficient cause as he speaks be turnd into pure gold and the experiencd alexander van suchten somewhere tells us that by a way he intimates may be made a mercury of copper not of the silver colour of other mercuries but green to which i shall add that an eminent person whose name his travells and learned writings have made famous lately assurd me that he had more then once seen the mercury of lead which whatever authors promise you will find it very difficult to make at least in any considerable quantity fixt into perfect gold and being by me demanded whether or no any other mercury would not as well have been changed by the same operations he assured me of the negative footnote 21 dixi autem de argento vivo a metallis prolicito quod vulgare ob nimiam frigiditatem humiditatem nimium concoctioni est contumax nec ab auro solum alterato coerceri potest gast clave in apoll and since i am fallen upon the mention of the mercuries of metals you will perhaps expect eleutherius that i should say something of their two other principles but must freely confess to you that what disparity there may be between the salts and sulphurs of metals and other menerals transcribers note minerals i am not my self experienced enough in the separations and examens of them to venture to determine for as for the salts of metals i formerly represented it as a thing much to be questiond whether they have any at all and for the processes of separation i find in authors if they were what many of them are not successfully practicable as i noted above yet they are to be performed by the assistance of other bodies so hardly if upon any termes at all separable from them that it is very difficult to give the separated principles all their due and no more but the sulphur of antimony which is vehemently vomitive and the strongly scented anodyne sulphur of vitriol inclines me to think that not only mineral sulphurs differ from vegetable ones but also from one another retaining much of the nature of their concretes the salts of metals and of some sort of minerals you will easily guesse by errata by the doubts i formerly expressd whether metals have any salt at all errata all that i have not been so happy as yet to see perhaps not for want of curiosity but if paracelsus did alwaies write so consentaneously to himself that his opinion were confidently to be collected from every place of his writings where he seems to expresse it i might safely take upon me to tell you that he both countenances in general what i have delivered in my fourth main consideration and in particular warrants me to suspect that there may be a difference in metalline and mineral salts as well as we find it in those of other bodies for sulphur sayes he22 aliud in auro aliud in argento aliud in ferro aliud in plumbo stanno c sic aliud in saphiro aliud in smaragdo aliud in rubino chrysolito amethisto magnete c item aliud in lapidibus

metallis gemmis ut quot saphyri prstantiores lvioris c tot etiam saphyrica sulphura saphyrica salia saphyrici mercurii c idem verum etiam est de turconibus gemmis aliis universis from which passage eleutherius i suppose you will think i might without rashness conclude either that my opinion is favoured by that of paracelsus or that paracelsus his opinion was not alwaies the same but because in divers other places of his writings he seems to talk at a differing rate of the three principles and the four elements i shall content my self to inferr from the alledgd passage that if his doctrine be not consistent with that part of mine which it is brought to countenance it is very difficult to know what his opinion concerning salt sulphur and mercury was and that consequently we had reason about the beginning of our conferences to decline taking upon us either to examine or oppose it footnote 22 paracel de mineral tract 1 pag 141 i know not whether i should on this occasion add that those very bodies the chymists call phlegme and earth do yet recede from an elementary simplicity that common earth and water frequently do so notwithstanding the received contrary opinion is not denyd by the more wary of the moderne peripateticks themselves and certainly most earths are much lesse simple bodies then is commonly imagined even by chymists who do not so consideratly to prescribe and employ earths promiscuously in those distillations that require the mixture of some caput mortuum to hinder the flowing together of the matter and to retain its grosser parts for i have found some earths to yield by distillation a liquor very far from being inodorous or insipid and tis a known observation that most kinds of fat earth kept coverd from the rain and hindred from spending themselves in the production of vegetables will in time become impregnated with saltpetre but i must remember that the water and earths i ought here to speak of are such as are separated from mixt bodies by the fire and therefore to restrain my discourse to such i shall tell you that we see the phlegme of vitriol for instance is a very effectual remedie against burnes and i know a very famous and experiencd physitian whose unsuspected secret himself confessd to me it is for the discussing of hard and obstinate tumours the phlegme of vinager though drawn exceeding leasurly in a digesting furnace i have purposely made tryall of and sometimes found it able to draw though slowly a saccharine sweetness out of lead and as i remember by long digestion i dissolvd corpals errata corals in it the phlegme of the sugar of saturne is said to have very peculiar properties divers eminent chymists teach that it will dissolve pearls which being precipitated by the spirit of the same concrete are thereby as they say rendred volatile which has been confirmed to me upon his own observation by a person of great veracity the phlegme of wine and indeed divers other liquors that are indiscriminately condemnd to be cast away as phlegm are endowd with qualities that make them differ both from meer water and from each other and whereas the chymists are pleasd to call the caput mortuum of what they have distilld after they have by affusion of water drawn away its salt terra damnata or earth it may be doubted whether or no those earths are all of them perfectly alike and it is scarce to be doubted but that there are some of them which remain yet unreducd to an elementary nature the ashes of wood deprivd of all the salt and boneashes or calcind hartshorn which refiners choose to make tests of as freest from salt seem unlike and he that shall compare either of these insipid ashes to lime and much more to the calx of talk transcribers note talck though by the affusion of water they be exquisitely dulcifyd will perhaps see cause to think them things of a somewhat differing nature and it is evident in colcothar that the exactest calcination followd by an exquisite dulcification does not alwaies reduce the remaining body into elementary earth for after the salt or vitriol if the calcination have been too faint is drawn out of the colcothar the residue is not earth but a mixt body rich in medical vertues as experience has informd me and which angelus sala affirmes to be partly reducible into malleable copper which i judge very probable for though when i was making experiments upon colcothar i was destitute of a furnace capable of giving a heat intense enough to bring such a calx to fusion yet having conjecturd that if colcothar abounded with that metal aqua fortis would find it out there i put some dulcifid colcothar into that menstruum and found the liquor according to my expectation presently colourd as highly as if it had been an ordinary solution of copper the sceptical chymist the fifth part here carneades making a pause i must not deny sayes his friend to him that i think you have sufficiently provd that these distinct substances which chymists are wont to obtain from mixt bodies by their vulgar destillation are not pure and simple enough to deserve in rigour of speaking the name of elements or principles but i suppose you have heard that there are some modern spagyrists who give out that they can by further and more skilfull purifications so reduce the separated ingredients of mixt bodies to an elementary simplicity that the oyles for instance extracted from all mixts shall as perfectly resemble one another as the drops of water do if you remember replies carneades that at the beginning of our conference with philoponus i declard to him before the rest of the company that i would not engage my self at present to do any more then examine the usual proofs alledgd by chymists for the vulgar doctrine of their three hypostatical principles you will easily perceive that i am not obligd to make answer to what you newly proposd and that it rather grants then disproves what i have been contending for since by pretending to make so great a change in the reputed principles that destillation affords the common spagyrists tis plainly enough presupposd that before such artificial depurations be made the substances to be made more simple were not yet simple enough to be lookd upon as elementary wherefore in case the artists you speak of could perform what they give out they can yet i should not need to be ashamd of having questiond the vulgar opinion touching the tria prima and as to the thing it self i shall freely acknowledge to you that i love not to be forward in determining things to be impossible till i know and have considerd the means by which they are proposd to be effected and therefore i shall not peremptorily deny either the possibility of what these artists promise or my assent to any just inference however destructive to my conjectures that may be drawn from their performances but give me leave to tell you withall that because such promises are wont as experience has more then once informd me to be much more easily made then made good by chymists i must withhold my beliefe from their assertions till their experiments exact it and must not be so easie as to expect before hand an unlikely thing upon no stronger inducements then are yet given me besides that i have not yet found by what i have heard of these artists that though they pretend to bring the several substances into which the fire has divided the concrete to an exquisite simplicity they pretend also to be able by the fire to divide all concretes minerals and others into the same number of distinct substances and in the mean time i must think it improbable that they can either truly separate as many differing bodies from gold for instance or osteocolla as we can do from wine or vitriol or that the mercury for example of gold or saturn would be perfectly of the same nature with that of hartshorn and that the sulphur of antimony would be but numerically different from the distilld butter or oyle of roses but suppose sayes eleutherius that you should meet with chymists who would allow you to take in earth and water into the number of the principles of mixt bodies and being also content to change the ambiguous name of mercury for that more intelligible one of spirit should consequently make the principles of compound bodies to be five would you not think it something hard to reject so plausible an opinion only because the five substances into which the fire divides mixt bodies are not exactly pure and homogeneous for my part continues carneades i cannot but think it somewhat strange in case this opinion be not true that it should fall out so luckily that so great a variety of bodies should be analyzd by the fire into just five distinct substances which so little differing from the bodies that bear those names may so plausibly be calld oyle spirit salt water and earth the opinion you now propose answers carneades being another then that i was engagd to examine it is not requisite for me to debate it at present nor should i have leisure to do it thorowly wherefore i shall only tell you in general that though i think this opinion in some respects more defensible then that of the vulgar chymists yet you may easily enough learn from the past discourse what may be thought of it since many of the objections made against the vulgar doctrine of the chymists seem without much alteration employable against this hypothesis also for besides that this doctrine does as well as the other take it for granted what is not easie to be provd that the fire is the true and adequate analyzer of bodies and that all the distinct substances obtainable from a mixt body by the fire were so preexistent in it that they were but extricated from each other by the analysis besides that this opinion too ascribe errata ascribes to the productions of the fire an elementary simplicity which i have shewn not to belong to them and besides that this doctrine is lyable to some of the other difficulties wherewith that of the tria prima is incumberd besides all this i say this quinary number of elements if you pardon the expression ought at least to have been restraind to the generality of animal and vegetable bodies since not only among these there are some bodies as i formerly argud which for ought has yet been made to appear do consist either of fewer or more similar substances then precisely five but in the mineral kingdom there is scarce one concrete that has been evincd to be adequatly divisible into such five principles or elements and neither more nor less as this opinion would have every mixt body to consist of and this very thing continues carneades may serve to take away or lessen your wonder that just so many bodies as five should be found upon the resolution of concretes for since we find not that the fire can make any such analysis into five elements of metals and other mineral bodies whose texture is more strong and permanent it remains that the five substances under consideration be obtaind from vegetable and animal bodies which probably by reason of their looser contexture are capable of being distilld and as to such bodies tis natural enough that whether we suppose that there are or are not precisely five elements there should ordinarily occurr in the dissipated parts a five fold diversity of scheme if i may so speak for if the parts do not remain all fixd as in gold calcind talck c nor all ascend as in the sublimation of brimstone camphire c but after their dissipation do associate themselves into new schemes of matter it is very likely that they will by the fire be divided into fixd and volatile i mean in reference to that degree of heat by which they are destilld and those volatile parts will for the most part ascend either in a dry forme which chymists are pleasd to call if they be tastless flowers if sapid volatile salt or in a liquid forme and this liquor must be either inflamable and so pass for oyl or not inflamable and yet subtile and pungent which may be calld spirit or else strengthless or insipid which may be namd phlegme or water and as for the fixt part or caput mortuum it will most commonly consist of corpuscles partly soluble in water or sapid especially if the saline parts were not so volatile as to fly away before which make up its fixt salt and partly insoluble and insipid which therefore seems to challenge the name of earth but although upon this ground one might easily enough have foretold that the differing substances obtaind from a perfectly mixt body by the fire would for the most part be reducible to the five newly mentioned states of matter yet it will not presently follow that these five distinct substances were simple and primogeneal bodies so preexistent in the concrete that the fire does but take them asunder besides that it does not appear that all mixt bodies witness gold silver mercury c nay nor perhaps all vegetables which may appear by what we said above of camphire benzoin c are resoluble by fire into just such differing schemes of matter nor will the experiments formerly alledgd permit us to look upon these separated substances as elementary or uncompounded neither will it be a sufficient argument of their being bodies that deserve the names which chymists are pleasd to give them that they have an analogy in point of consistence or either volatility or fixtness or else some other obvious quality with the supposd principles whose names are ascribd to them for as i told you above notwithstanding this resemblance in some one quality there may be such a disparity in others as may be more fit to give them differing appellations then the resemblance is to give them one and the same and indeed it seems but somewhat a gross way of judging of the nature of bodies to conclude without scruple that those must be of the same nature that agree in some such general quality as fluidity dryness volatility and the like since each of those qualities or states of matter may comprehend a great variety of bodies otherwise of a very differing nature as we may see in the calxes of gold of vitriol and of venetian talck compard with common ashes which yet are very dry and fixd by the vehemence of the fire as well as they and as we may likewise gather from what i have formerly observd touching the spirit of boxwood which though a volatile sapid and not inflamable liquor as well as the spirits of hartshorn of blood and others and therefore has been hitherto calld the spirit and esteemd for one of the principles of the wood that affords it may yet as i told you be subdivided into two liquors differing from one another and one of them at least from the generality of other chymical spirits but you may your self if you please pursues carneades accommodate to the hypothesis you proposd what other particulars you shall think applicable to it in the foregoing discourse for i think it unseasonable for me to meddle now any further with a controversie which since it does not now belong to me leaves me at liberty to take my own time to declare my self about it eleutherius perceiving that carneades was somewhat unwilling to spend any more time upon the debate of this opinion and having perhaps some thoughts of taking hence a rise to make him discourse it more fully another time thought not fit as then to make any further mention to him of the proposd opinion but told him i presume i need not mind you carneades that both the patrons of the ternary number of principles and those that would have five elements endeavour to back their experiments with a specious reason or two and especially some of those embracers of the opinion last namd whom i have conversd with and found them learned men assigne this reason of the necessity of five distinct elements that otherwise mixt bodies could not be so compounded and temperd as to obtain a due consistence and competent duration for salt say they is the basis of solidity and permanency in compound bodies without which the other four elements might indeed be variously and loosly blended together but would remain incompacted but that salt might be dissolvd into minute parts and conveyd to the other substances to be compacted by it and with it there is a necessity of water and that the mixture may not be too hard and brittle a sulphureous or oyly principle must intervene to make the mass more tenacious to this a mercurial spirit must be superadded which by its activity may for a while premeate transcribers note permeate and as it were leaven the whole mass and thereby promote the more exquisite mixture and incorporation of the ingredients to all which lastly a portion of earth must be added which by its drinesse and poracity errata porosity may soak up part of that water wherein the salt was dissolvd and eminently concurr with the other ingredients to give the whole body the requisite consistence i perceive sayes carneades smiling that if it be true as twas lately rooted errata noted from the proverb that good wits have bad memories you have that title as well as a better to a place among the good wits for you have already more then once forgot that i declard to you that i would at this conference examine only the experiments of my adversaries not their speculative reasons yet tis not subjoynes carneades for fear of medling with the argument you have proposd that i decline the examining it at present for if when we are more at leasure you shall have a mind that we may solemnly consider of it together i am confident we shall scarce find it insoluble and in the mean time we may observe that such a way of arguing may it seems be speciously accommodated to differing hypotheses for i find that beguinus and other assertors of the tria prima pretend to make out by such a way the requisiteness of their salt sulphur and mercury to constitute mixt bodies without taking notice of any necessity of an addition of water and earth and indeed neither sort of chymists seem to have duly considerd how great variety there is in the textures and consistences of compound bodie sand errata bodies and how little the consistence and duration of many of them seem to accommodate and be explicable by the proposd notion and not to mention those almost incorruptible substances obtainable by the fire which i have provd to be somewhat compounded and which the chymists will readily grant not to be perfectly mixt bodies not to mention these i say if you will but recall to mind some of those experiments whereby i shewd you that out of common water only mixt bodies and even living ones of very differing consistences and resoluble by fire into as many principles as other bodies acknowledgd to be perfectly mixt if you do this i say you will not i suppose be averse from beleeving that nature by a convenient disposition of the minute parts of a portion of matter may contrive bodies durable enough and of this or that or the other consistence without being obligd to make use of all much less of any determinate quantity of each of the five elements or of the three principles to compound such bodies of and i have pursues carneades something wonderd chymists should not consider that there is scarce any body in nature so permanent and indissoluble as glass which yet themselves teach us may be made of bare ashes brought to fusion by the meer violence of the fire so that since ashes are granted to consist but of pure salt and simple earth sequestred from all the other principles or elements they must acknowledge that even art it self can of two elements only or if you please one principle and one element compound a body more durable then almost any in the world which being undeniable how will they prove that nature cannot compound mixt bodies and even durable ones under all the five elements or material principles but to insist any longer on this occasional disquisition touching their opinion that would establish five elements were to remember as little as you did before that the debate of this matter is no part of my first undertaking and consequently that i have already spent time enough in what i look back upon but as a digression or at best an excursion and thus eleutherius sayes carneades having at length gone through the four considerations i proposd to discourse unto you i hold it not unfit for fear my having insisted so long on each of them may have made you forget their series briefly to repeat them by telling you that since in the first place it may justly be doubted whether or no the fire be as chymists suppose it the genuine and universal resolver of mixt bodies since we may doubt in the next place whether or no all the distinct substances that may be obtaind from a mixt body by the fire were preexistent there in the formes in which they were separated from it since also though we should grant the substances separable from mixt bodies by the fire to have been their component ingredients yet the number of such substances does not appear the same in all mixt bodies some of them being resoluble into more differing substances than three and others not being resoluble into so many as three and since lastly those very substances that are thus separated are not for the most part pure and elementary bodies but new kinds of mixts since i say these things are so i hope you will allow me to inferr that the vulgar experiments i might perchance have added the arguments too wont to be alledgd by chymists to prove that their three hypostatical principles do adequately compose all mixt bodies are not so demonstrative as to reduce a wary person to acquiesce in their doctrine which till they explain and prove it better will by its perplexing darkness be more apt to puzzle then satisfy considering men and will to them appear incumbred with no small difficulties and from what has been hitherto deducd continues carneades we may learn what to judge of the common practice of those chymists who because they have found that diverse compound bodies for it will not hold in all can be resolvd into or rather can be brought to afford two or three differing substances more then the soot and ashes whereinto the naked fire commonly divides them in our chymnies cry up their own sect for the invention of a new philosophy some of them as helmont c styling themselves philosophers by the fire and the most part not only ascribing but as far as in them lies engrossing to those of their sect the title of philosophers but alas how narrow is this philosophy that reaches but to some of those compound bodies which we find but upon or in the crust or outside of our terrestrial globe which is it self but a point in comparison of the vast extended universe of whose other and greater parts the doctrine of the tria prima does not give us an account for what does it teach us either of the nature of the sun which astronomers affirme to be eightscore and odd times bigger then the whole earth or of that of those numerous fixt starrs which for ought we know would very few if any of them appear inferiour in bulke and brightness to the sun if they were as neer us as he what does the knowing that salt sulphur and mercury are the principles of mixt bodies informe us of the nature of that vast fluid and therial substance that seemes to make up the interstellar and consequently much the greatest part of the world for as for the opinion commonly ascribd to paracelsus as if he would have not only the four peripatetick elements but even the celestial parts of the universe to consist of his three principles since the modern chymists themselves have not thought so groundless a conceit worth their owning i shall not think it worth my confuting but i should perchance forgive the hypothesis i have been all this while examining if though it reaches but to a very little part of the world it did at least give us a satisfactory account of those things to which tis said to reach but i find not that it gives us any other then a very imperfect information even about mixt bodies themselves for how will the knowledge of the tria prima discover to us the reason why the loadstone drawes a needle and disposes it to respect the poles and yet seldom precisely points at them how will this hypothesis teach us how a chick is formed in the egge or how the seminal principles of mint pompions and other vegitables that i mentiond to you above can fashion water into various plants each of them endowd with its peculiar and determinate shape and with divers specifick and discriminating qualities how does this hypothesis shew us how much salt how much sulphur and how much mercury must be taken to make a chick or a pompion and if we know that what principle is it that manages these ingredients and contrives for instance such liquors as the white and yelk of an egge into such a variety of textures as is requisite to fashion the bones veines arteries nerves tendons feathers blood and other parts of a chick and not only to fashion each limbe but to connect them altogether after that manner that is most congruous to the perfection of the animal which is to consist of them for to say that some more fine and subtile part of either or all the hypostatical principles is the director in all this business and the architect of all this elaborate structure is to give one occasion to demand again what proportion and way of mixture of the tria prima afforded this architectonick spirit and what agent made so skilful and happy a mixture and the answer to this question if the chymists will keep themselves within their three principles will be lyable to the same inconvenience that the answer to the former was and if it were not to intrench upon the theame of a friend of ours here present i could easily prosecute the imperfections of the vulgar chymists philosophy and shew you that by going about to explicate by their three principles i say not all the abstruse properties of mixt bodies but even such obvious and more familiar phnomena as fluidity and firmness the colours and figures of stones minerals and other compound bodies the nutrition of either plants or animals the gravity of gold or quicksilver compard with wine or spirit of wine by attempting i say to render a reason of these to omit a thousand others as difficult to account for from any proportion of the three simple ingredients chymists will be much more likely to discredit themselves and their hypothesis then satisfy an intelligent inquirer after truth but interposes eleutherus transcribers note eleutherius this objection seems no more then may be made against the four peripatetick elements and indeed almost against any other hypothesis that pretends by any determinate number of material ingredients to render a reason of the phnomena of nature and as for the use of the chymical doctrine of the three principles i suppose you need not be told by me that the great champion of it the learned sennertus23 assignes this noble use of the tria prima that from them as the neerest and most proper principles may be deducd and demonstrated the properties which are in mixt bodies and which cannot be proximately as they speak deducd from the elements and this sayes he is chiefly apparent when we inquire into the properties and faculties of medecines and i know continues eleutherius that the person you have assumd of an opponent of the hermetick doctrine will not so far prevaile against your native and wonted equity as to keep you from acknowledging that philosophy is much beholden to the notions and discoveries of chymists footnote 23 senn de cons dissen p 165 if the chymists you speak of replyes carneades had been so modest or so discreet as to propose their opinion of the tria prima but as a notion useful among others to increase humane knowledge they had deservd more of our thanks and less of our opposition but since the thing that they pretend is not so much to contribute a notion toward the improvement of philosophy as to make this notion attended errata attended by a few lesse considerable ones pass for a new philosophy itself nay since they boast so much of this phancie of theirs that the famous quercetanus scruples not to write that if his most certain doctrine of the three principles were sufficiently learned examind and cultivated it would easily dispel all the darkness that benights our minds and bring in a clear light that would remove all difficulties this school affording theorems and axiomes irrefragable and to be admitted without dispute by impartial judges and so useful withal as to exempt us from the necessity of having recourse for want of the knowledg of causes to that sanctuary of the igorant transcribers note ignorant occult qualities since i say this domestick notion of the chymists is so much overvalued by them i cannot think it unfit they should be made sensible of their mistake and be admonishd to take in more fruitful and comprehensive principles if they mean to give us an account of the phnomena of nature and not confine themselves and as far as they can others to such narrow principles as i fear will scarce inable them to give an account i mean an intelligible one of the tenth part i say not of all the phnomena of nature but even of all such as by the leucippian or some of the other sorts of principles may be plausibly enough explicated and though i be not unwilling to grant that the incompetency i impute to the chymical hypothesis is but the same which may be objected against that of the four elements and divers other doctrines that have been maintaind by learned men yet since tis the chymical hypothesis only which i am now examining i see not why if what i impute to it be a real inconvenience either it should cease to be so or i should scruple to object it because either theories are lyable thereunto as well as the hermetical for i know not why a truth should be thought lesse a truth for the being fit to overthrow variety of errors i am obligd to you continues carneades a little smiling for the favourable opinion you are pleasd to express of my equity if there be no design in it but i need not be tempted by an artifice or invited by a complement to acknowledge the great service that the labours of chymists have done the lovers of useful learning nor even on this occasion shall their arrogance hinder my gratitude but since we are as well examining to errata delete to the truth of their doctrine as the merit of their industry i must in order to the investigation of the first continue a reply to talk at the rate of the part i have assumd and tell you that when i acknowledg the usefulness of the labours of spagyrists to natural philosophy i do it upon the score of their experiments not upon that of their speculations for it seems to me that their writings as their furnaces afford as well smoke as light and do little lesse obscure some subjects then they illustrate others and though i am unwilling to deny that tis difficult for a man to be an accomplisht naturalist that is a stranger to chymistry yet i look upon the common operations and practices of chymists almost as i do on the letters of the alphabet without whose knowledge tis very hard for a man to become a philosopher and yet that knowledge is very far from being sufficient to make him one but sayes carneades resuming a more serious look to consider a little more particularly what you alledg in favour of the chymical doctrine of the tria prima though i shall readily acknowledge it not to be unuseful and that the divisers errata devisers and embracers of it have done the commonwealth of learning some service by helping to destroy that excessive esteem or rather veneration wherewith the doctrine of the four elements was almost as generally as undeservedly entertaind yet what has been alledgd concerning the usefulness of the tria prima seems to me liable to no contemptible difficulties and first as for the very way of probation which the more learned and more sober champions of the chymical cause employ to evince the chymical principles in mixt bodies it seems to me to be farr enough from being convincing this grand and leading argument your sennertus himself who layes great weight upon it and tells us that the most learned philosophers employ this way of reasoning to prove the most important things proposes thus ubicunque sayes he pluribus edem affectiones qualitates insunt per commune quoddam principium insint necesse est sicut omnia sunt gravia propter terram calida propter ignem at colores odores sapores esse greek phlogiston similia alia mineralibus metallis gemmis lapidibus plantis animalibus insunt ergo per commune aliquod principium subiectum insunt at tale principium non sunt elementa nullam enim habent ad tales qualitates producendas potentiam ergo alia principia unde fluant inquirenda sunt in the recital of this argument sayes carneades i therefore thought fit to retain the language wherein the author proposes it that i might also retain the propriety of some latine termes to which i do not readily remember any that fully answer in english but as for the argumentation it self tis built upon a precarious supposition that seems to me neither demonstrable nor true for how does it appear that where the same quality is to be met with in many bodies it must belong to them upon the account of some one body whereof they all partake for that the major of our authors argument is to be understood of the material ingredients of bodies appears by the instances of earth and fire he annexes to explain it for to begin with that very example which he is pleasd to alledge for himself how can he prove that the gravity of all bodies proceeds from what they participate of the element of earth since we see that not only common water but the more pure distilld rain water is heavy and quicksilver is much heavier than earth it self though none of my adversaries has yet provd that it contains any of that element and i the rather make use of this example of quicksilver because i see not how the assertors of the elements will give any better account of it then the chymists for if it be demanded how it comes to be fluid they will answer that it participates much of the nature of water and indeed according to them water may be the predominant element in it since we see that several bodies which by distillation afford liquors that weigh more then their caput mortuum do not yet consist of liquor enough to be fluid yet if it be demanded how quicksilver comes to be so heavy then tis replyd that tis by reason of the earth that abounds in it but since according to them it must consist also of air and partly of fire which they affirm to be light elements how comes it that it should be so much heavier then earth of the same bulk though to fill up the porosities and other cavities it be made up into a mass or paste with water which it self they allow to be a heavy element but to returne to our spagyrists we see that chymical oyles and fixt salts though never so exquisitely purifyd and freed from terrestrial parts do yet remain ponderous enough and experience has informd me that a pound for instance of some of the heaviest woods as guajacum that will sink in water being burnt to ashes will yield a much less weight of them whereof i found but a small part to be alcalyzate then much lighter vegetables as also that the black charcoal of it will not sink as did the wood but swim which argues that the differing gravity of bodies proceeds chiefly from their particular texture as is manifest in gold the closest and compactest of bodies which is many times heavier then we can possibly make any parcell of earth of the same bulk i will not examine what may be argud touching the gravity or quality analagous thereunto of even celestial bodies from the motion of the spots about the sun d errata and from the appearing equality of the supposd seas in the moon nor consider how little those phmonea transcribers note phnomena would agree with what sennertus presumes concerning gravity but further to invalidate his supposition i shall demand upon what chymical principle fluidity depends and yet fluidity is two or three perhaps excepted the most diffused quality of the universe and far more general then almost any other of those that are to be met with in any of the chymicall principles or aristotelian elements since not only the air but that vast expansion we call heaven in comparison of which our terrestrial globe supposing it were all solid is but a point and perhaps to errata too the sun and the fixt stars are fluid bodies i demand also from which of the chymical principles motion flowes which yet is an affection of matter much more general then any that can be deducd from any of the three chymical principles i might ask the like question concerning light which is not only to be found in the kindld sulphur of mixt bodis transcribers note bodies but not to mention those sorts of rotten woods and rotten fish that shine in the dark in the tails of living glowwormes and in the vast bodies of the sun and stars i would gladly also know in which of the three principles the quality we call sound resides as in its proper subject since either oyl falling upon oyle or spirit upon spirit or salt upon salt in a great quantity and from a considerable height will make a noise or if you please create a sound and that the objection may reach the aristotelians so will also water upon water and earth upon earth and i could name other qualities to be met within divers bodies of which i suppose my adversaries will not in haste assign any subject upon whose account it must needs be that the quality belongs to all the other several bodies and before i proceed any further i must here invite you to compare the supposition we are examining with some other of the chymical tenents for first they do in effect teach that more then one quality may belong to and be deducd from one principle for they ascribe to salt tasts and the power of coagulation to sulphur as well odours as inflamableness and some of them ascribe to mercury colours as all of them do effumability as they speak and on the other side it is evident that volatility belongs in common to all the three principles and to water too for tis manifest that chymical oyles are volatile that also divers salts emerging upon the analysis of many concretes are very volatile is plain from the figitiveness errata fugitivenesse of salt of hartshorne flesh c ascending in the distillation of those bodies how easily water may be made to ascend in vapours there is scarce any body that has not observd and as for what they call the mercuriall principle of bodies that is so apt to be raisd in the form of steam that paracelsus and others define it by that aptness to fly up so that to draw that inference by the way it seems not that chymists have been accurate in their doctrine of qualities and their respective principles since they both derive several qualities from the same principle and must ascribe the same quality to almost all their principles and other bodies besides and thus much for the first thing taken for granted without sufficient proof by your sennertus and to add that upon the bye continues carneades we may hence learn what to judge of the way of argumentation which that fierce champion of the aristotelians against the chymists anthonius guntherus billichius24 employes where he pretends to prove against beguinus that not only the four elements do immediately concur to constitute every mixt body and are both present in it and obtainable from it upon its dissolution but that in the tria prima themselves whereinto chymists are wont to resolve mixt bodies each of them clearly discovers it self to consist of four elements the ratiocination it self pursues carneades being somewhat unusual i did the other day transcribe it and sayes he pulling a paper out of his pocket it is this ordiamur cum beguino a ligno viridi quod si concremetur videbis in sudore aquam in fumo aerem in flamma prunis ignem terram in cineribus quod si beguino placuerit ex eo colligere humidum aquosum cohibere humidum oleaginosum extrahere ex

sententia qu de viridis ligni humore aquoso qu de liquore ejusdem oleoso qu de sale fuit footnote 24 in thessalo redivivo cap 10 pag 73 74 this bold discourse resumes carneades putting up again his paper i think it were not very difficult to confute if his arguments were as considerable as our time will probably prove short for the remaining and more necessary part of my discourse wherefore referring you for an answer to what was said concerning the dissipated parts of a burnt piece of green wood to what i told themistius on the like occasion i might easily shew you how sleightly and superficially our guntherus talks of the dividing the flame of green wood into his four elements when he makes that vapour to be air which being caught in glasses and condensd presently discovers it self to have been but an aggregate of innumerable very minute drops of liquor and when he would prove the phlegmes being composd of fire by that heat which is adventitious to the liquor and ceases upon the absence of what producd it whether that be an agitation proceeding from the motion of the external fire or the presence of a multitude of igneous atomes pervading the pores of the vessel and nimbly permeating the whole body of the water i might i say urge these and divers other weaknesses of his discourse but i will rather take notice of what is more pertinent to the occasion of this digression namely that taking it for granted that fluidity with which he unwarily seems to confound humidity must proceed from the element of water he makes a chymical oyle to consist of that elementary liquor and yet in the very next words proves that it consists also of fire by its inflamability not remembring that exquisitely pure spirit of wine is both more fluid then water it self and yet will flame all away without leaving the least aqueous moisture behind it and without such an amurca and soot as he would deduce the presence of earth from so that the same liquor may according to his doctrine be concluded by its great fluidity to be almost all water and by its burning all away to be all disguised fire and by the like way of probation our author would shew that the fixt salt of wood is compounded of the four elements for sayes he being turnd by the violence of the fire into steames it shews it self to be of kin to air whereas i doubt whether he ever saw a true fixt salt which to become so must have already endurd the violence of an incinerating fire brought by the fire alone to ascend in the forme of exhalations but i do not doubt that if he did and had caught those exhalations in convenient vessels he would have found them as well as the steames of common salt c of a saline and not an aereal nature and whereas our authour takes it also for granted that the fusibility of salt must be deducd from water it is indeed so much the effect of heat variously agitating the minute parts of a body without regard to water that gold which by its being the heavyest and fixtest of bodies should be the most earthy will be brought to fusion by a strong fire which sure is more likely to drive away then increase its aqueous ingredient if it have any and on the other side for want of a sufficient agitation of its minute parts ice is not fluid but solid though he presumes also that the mordicant quality of bodies must proceed from a fiery ingredient whereas not to urge that the light and inflamable parts which are the most likely to belong to the element of fire must probably be driven away by that time the violence of the fire has reducd the body to ashes not to urge this i i transcribers note extra i in original say nor that oyle of vitriol which quenches fire burnes the tongue and flesh of those that unwarily tast or apply it as a caustick doth it is precarious to prove the presence of fire in fixt salts from their caustick power unlesse it were first shewn that all the qualities ascribed to salts must be deducd from those of the elements which had i time i could easily manifest to be no easy talk and not to mention that our authour makes a body as homogeneous as any he can produce for elementary belong both to water and fire though it be neither fluid nor insipid like water nor light and volatile like fire he seems to omit in this anatomy the element of earth save that he intimates that the salt may pass for that but since a few lines before he takes ashes for earth i see not how he will avoid an inconsistency either betwixt the parts of his discourse or betwixt some of them and his doctrine for since there is a manifest difference betwixt the saline and the insipid parts of ashes i see not how substances that disagree in such notable qualities can be both said to be portions of an element whose nature requires that it be homogeneous especially in this case where an analysis by the fire is supposd to have separated it from the admixture of other elements which are confessd by most aristotelians to be generally found in common earth and to render it impure and sure if when we have considerd for how little a disparities sake the peripateticks make these symbolizing bodies aire and fire to be two distinct elements we shall also consider that the saline part of ashes is very strongly tasted and easily soluble in water whereas the other part of the same ashes is insipid and indissoluble in the same liquor not to add that the one substance is opacous and the other somewhat diaphanous nor that they differ in divers other particulars if we consider those things i say we shall hardly think that both these substances are elementary earth and as to what is sometimes objected that their saline tast is only an effect of incineration and adustion it has been elsewhere fully replyd to when proposd by themistius and where it has been provd against him that however insipid earth may perhaps by additaments be turnd into salt yet tis not like it should be so by the fire alone for we see that when we refine gold and silver the violentest fires we can employ on them give them not the least rellish of saltness and i think philoponus has rightly observd that the ashes of some concretes contain very little salt if any at all for refiners suppose that boneashes are free from it and therefore make use of them for tests and cuppels which ought to be destitute of salt lest the violence of the fire should bring them to vitrification and having purposely and heedfully tasted a cuppel made of only boneashes and fair water which i had causd to be exposd to a very violent fire acuated by the blast of a large pair of double bellows i could not perceive that the force of the fire had imparted to it the least saltness or so much as made it less insipid but sayes carneades since neither you nor i love repetitions i shall not now make any of what else was urgd against themistius but rather invite you to take notice with me that when our authour though a learned man and one that pretends skill enough in chymistry to reforme the whole art comes to make good his confident undertaking to give us an occular demonstration of the immediate presence of the four elements in the resolution of green wood he is fain to say things that agree very little with one another for about the beginning of that passage of his lately recited to you he makes the sweat as he calls it of the green wood to be water the smoke aire the shining matter fire and the ashes earth whereas a few lines after he will in each of these nay as i just now noted in one distinct part of the ashes shew the four elements so that either the former analysis must be incompetent to prove that number of elements since by it the burnt concrete is not reducd into elementary bodies but into such as are yet each of them compounded of the four elements or else these qualities from which he endeavours to deduce the presence of all the elements in the fixt salt and each of the other separated substances will be but a precarious way of probation especially if you consider that the extracted alcali of wood being for ought appears at least as similar a body as any that the peripateticks can shew us if its differing qualities must argue the presence of distinct elements it will scarce be possible for them by any way they know of employing the fire upon a body to shew that any body is a portion of a true element and this recals to my mind that i am now but in an occasional excussion which aiming only to shew that the peripateticks as well as the chymists take in our present controversie something for granted which they ought to prove i shall returne to my exceptions where i ended the first of them and further tell you that neither is that the only precarious thing that i take notice of in sennertus his argumentation for when he inferrs that because the qualities he mentions as colours smels and the like belong not to the elements they therefore must to the chymical principles he takes that for granted which will not in haste be provd as i might here manifest but that i may by and by have a fitter opportunity to take notice of it and thus much at present may suffice to have discoursd against the supposition that almost every quality must have some greek dektikon prton as they speak some native receptacle wherein as in its proper subject of inhesion it peculiarly resides and on whose account that quality belongs to the other bodies wherein it is to be met with now this fundamental supposition being once destroyd whatsoever is built upon it must fall to ruine of it self but i consider further that chymists are for ought i have found far from being able to explicate by any of the tria prima those qualities which they pretend to belong primarily unto it and in mixt bodies to deduce from it tis true indeed that such qualities are not explicable by the four elements but it will not therefore follow that they are so by the three hermetical principles and this is it that seems to have deceivd the chymists and is indeed a very common mistake amongst most disputants who argue as if there could be but two opinions concerning the difficulty about which they contend and consequently they inferr that if their adversaries opinion be erroneous theirs must needs be the truth whereas many questions and especially in matters physiological may admit of so many differing hypotheses that twill be very inconsiderate and fallacious to conclude except where the opinions are precisely contradictory the truth of one from the falsity of another and in our particular case tis no way necessary that the properties of mixt bodies must be explicable either by the hermetical or the aristotelian hypothesis there being divers other and more plausible wayes of explaining them and especially that which deduces qualities from the motion figure and contrivance of the small parts of bodies as i think might be shewn if the attempt were as seasonable as i fear it would be tedious i will allow then that the chymists do not causelessly accuse the doctrine of the four elements of incompetency to explain the properties of compound bodies and for this rejection of a vulgar error they ought not to be denyd what praise men may deserve for exploding a doctrine whose imperfections are so conspicuous that men needed but not to shut their eyes to discover them but i am mistaken if our hermetical philosophers themselves need not as well as the peripateticks have recourse to more fruitfull and comprehensive principles then the tria prima to make out the properties of the bodies they converse with not to accumulate examples to this purpose because i hope for a fitter opportunity to prosecute this subject let us at present only point at colour that you may guess by what they say of so obvious and familiar a quality how little instruction we are to expect from the tria prima in those more abstruse ones which they with the aristotelians stile occult for about colours neither do they at all agree among themselves nor have i met with any one of which of the three perswasions soever that does intelligibly explicate them the vulgar chymists are wont to ascribe colours to mercury paracelsus in divers places attributes them to salt and sennertus25 having recited their differing opinions dissents from both and referrs colours rather unto sulphur but how colours do nay how they may arise from either of these principles i think you will scarce say that any has yet intelligibly explicated and if mr boyle will allow me to shew you the experiments which he has collected about colours you will i doubt not confess that bodies exhibite colours not upon the account of the predominancy of this or that principle in them but upon that of their texture and especially the disposition of their superficial parts whereby the light rebounding thence to the eye is so modifid as by differing impressions variously to affect the organs of sight i might here take notice of the pleasing variety of colours exhibited by the triangular glass as tis wont to be calld and demand what addition or decrement of either salt sulphur or mercury befalls the body of the glass by being prismatically figurd and yet tis known that without that shape it would not afford those colours as it does but because it may be objected that these are not real but apparent colours that i may not lose time in examing the distinction i will alledge against the chymists a couple of examples of real and permanent colours drawn from metalline bodies and represent that without the addition of any extraneous body quicksilver may by the fire alone and that in glass vessels be deprivd of its silverlike colour and be turnd into a red body and from this red body without addition likewise may be obtaind a mercury bright and specular as it was before so that i have here a lasting colour generated and destroyd as i have seen at pleasure without adding or taking away either mercury salt or sulphur and if you take a clean and slender piece of hardend steel and apply to it the flame of a candle at some little distance short of the point you shall not have held the steel long in the flame but you shall perceive divers colours as yellow red and blew to appear upon the surface of the metal and as it were run along in chase of one another towards the point so that the same body and that in one and the same part may not only have a new colour producd in it but exhibite successively divers colours within a minute of an hour or thereabouts and any of these colours may by removing the steel from the fire become permanent and last many years and this production and variety of colours cannot reasonably be supposd to proceed from the accession of any of the three principles to which of them soever chymists will be pleasd to ascribe colours especially considering that if you but suddenly refrigerate that iron first made red hot it will be hardend and colourless again and not only by the flame of a candle but by any other equivalent heat conveniently applid the like colours will again be made to appear and succeed one another as at the first but i must not any further prosecute an occasional discourse though that were not so difficult for me to do as i fear it would be for the chymists to give a better account of the other qualities by their principles then they have done of colours and your sennertus himself though an author i much value would i fear have been exceedingly puzld to resolve by the tria prima halfe that catalogue of problems which he challenges the vulgar peripateticks to explicate by their four elements26 and supposing it were true that salt or sulphur were the principle to which this or that quality may be peculiarly referrd yet though he that teaches us this teaches us something concerning that quality yet he teaches us but something for indeed he does not teach us that which can in any tollerable measure satisfie an inquisitive searcher after truth for what is it to me to know that such a quality resides in such a principle or element whilst i remain altogether ignorant of the cause of that quality and the manner of its production and operation how little do i know more then any ordinary man of gravity if i know but that the heaviness of mixt bodies proceeds from that of the earth they are composd of if i know not the reason why the earth is heavy and how little does the chymist teach the philosopher of the nature of purgatition if he only tells him that the purgative vertue of medicines resides in their salt for besides that this must not be conceded without limitation since the purging parts of many vegetables extracted by the water wherein they are infusd are at most but such compounded salts i mean mingld with oyle and spirit and earth as tartar and divers other subjects of the vegetable kingdom afford and since too that quicksilver precipitated either with gold or without addition into a powder is wont to be strongly enough cathartical though the chymists have not yet provd that either gold or mercury have any salt at all much less any that is purgative besides this i say how little is it to me to know that tis the salt of the rhubarb for instance that purges if i find that it does not purge as salt since scarce any elementary salt is in small quantity cathartical and if i know not how purgation in general is effected in a humane body in a word as tis one thing to know a mans lodging and another to be acquainted with him so it may be one thing to know the subject wherein a quality principally resides and another thing to have a right notion and knowledg of the quality its self now that which i take to be the reason of this chymical deficiency is the same upon whose account i think the aristotelian and divers other theories incompetent to explicate the origen errata origine of qualities for i am apt to think that men will never be able to explain the phnomena of nature while they endeavour to deduce them only from the presence and proportion of such or such material ingredients and consider such ingredients or elements as bodies in a state of rest whereas indeed the greatest part of the affections of matter and consequently of the phnomena of nature seems to depend upon the motion and the continuance errata contrivance of the small parts of bodies for tis by motion that one part of matter acts upon another and tis for the most part the texture of the body upon which the moving parts strike that modifies to motion or impression and concurrs with it to the production of those effects which make up the chief part of the naturalists theme footnote 25 de cons dissen cap 11 pag 186 footnote 26 sennert de con seus transcribers note consens dissens pag 165 166 but sayes eleutherius me thinks for all this you have left some part of what i alledgd in behalf of the three principles unanswerd for all that you have said will not keep this from being a useful discovery that since in the salt of one concrete in the sulphur of another and the mercury of a third the medicinal vertue of it resides that principle ought to be separated from the rest and there the desired faculty must be sought for i never denyed replyes carneades that the notion of the tria prima may be of some use but continues he laughing by what you now alledg for it it will but appear that it is useful to apothecaries rather than to philosophers the being able to make things operative being sufficient to those whereas the knowledge of causes is the thing looked after by these and let me tell you eleutherius even this it self will need to be entertained with some caution for first it will not presently follow that if the purgative or other vertue of a simple may be easily extracted by water or spirit of wine it resides in the salt or sulphur of the concrete since unlesse the body have before been resolved by the fire or some other powerful agent it will for the most part afford in the liquors i have named rather the finer compounded parts of it self than the elementary ones as i noted before that water will dissolve not only pure salts but crystals of tartar gumme arabick myrrh and other compound bodies as also spirit of wine will dissolve not only the pure sulphur of concretes but likewise the whole substance of divers resinous bodies as benzoin the gummous parts of jallap gumme lacca and other bodies that are counted perfectly mixt and we see that the extracts made either with water or spirit of wine are not of a simple and elementary nature but masses consisting of the looser corpuscles and finer parts of the concretes whence they are drawn since by distillation they may be divided into more elementary substances next we may consider that even when there intervenes a chymical resolution by he transcribers note the fire tis seldom in the saline or sulphureous principle as such that the desird faculty of the concrete resides but as that titular salt or sulphur is yet a mixt body though the saline or sulphureous nature be predominant in it for if in chymical resolutions the separated substances were pure and simple bodies and of a perfect elementary nature no one would be indued with more specifick vertues than another and their qualities would differ as little as do those of water and let me add this upon the bye that even eminent chymists have sufferd themselves to be reprehended by me for their over great diligence in purifying some of the things they obtain by fire from mixt bodies for though such compleatly purifyed ingredients of bodies might perhaps be more satisfactory to our understanding yet others are often more useful to our lives the efficacy of such chymical productions depending most upon what they retain of the bodies whence they are separated or gain by the new associations of the dissipated among themselves whereas if they were meerly elementary their uses would be comparatively very small and the vertues of sulphurs salts or other such substances of one denomination would be the very same and by the way eleutherius i am inclind upon this ground to think that the artificial resolution of compound bodies by fire does not so much enrich mankind as it divides them into their supposed principles as upon the score of its making new compounds by now transcribers note new combinations of the dissipated parts of the resolvd body for by this means the number of mixt bodies is considerably increased and many of those new productions are indowd with useful qualities divers of which they owe not to the body from which they were obteind but to their newly acquired texture but thirdly that which is principally to be noted is this that as there are divers concretes whose faculties reside in some one or other of those differing substances that chymists call their sulphurs salts and mercuries and consequently may be best obtaind by analyzing the concrete whereby the desired principles may be had severd or freed from the rest so there are other wherein the noblest properties lodge not in the salt or sulphur or mercury but depend immediately upon the form or if you will result from the determinate structure of the whole concrete and consequently they that go about to extract the vertues of such bodies by exposing them to the violence of the fire do exceedingly mistake and take the way to destroy what they would obtain i remmember that helmont himself somewhere confesses that as the fire betters some things and improves their vertues so it spoyles others and makes them degenerate and elsewhere he judiciously affirmes that there may be sometimes greater vertue in a simple such as nature has made it than in any thing that can by the fire be separated from it and lest you should doubt whether he means by the vertues of things those that are medical he has in one place27 this ingenuous confession credo sayes he simplicia in sua simplicitate esse sufficientia pro sanatione omnium morborum nag errata nay barthias even in a comment upon beguinus28 scruples not to make this acknowledgment valde absurdum est sayes he ex omnibus rebus extracta facere salia quintas essentias prsertim ex substantiis per se plane vel subtilibus vel homogeneis quales sunt uniones corallia moscus ambra c consonantly whereunto he also tells us and vouches the famous platerus for having candidly given the same advertisement to his auditors that some things have greater vertues and better suited to our humane nature when unprepard than when they have past the chymists fire as we see sayes my author in pepper of which some grains swallowed perform more towards the relief of a distempered stomack than a great quantity of the oyle of the same spice footnote 27 helmont pharm dispens nov p 458 footnote 28 vide jer ad begu lib 1 cap 17 it has been pursues carneades by our friend here present observd concerning saltpetre that none of the substances into which the fire is wont to divide it retaines either the tast the cooling vertue or some other of the properties of the concrete and that each of those substances acquires new qualities not to be found in the saltpetre it self the shining property of the tayls of gloworms does survive but so short a time the little animal made conspicuous by it that inquisitive men have not scrupled publickly to deride baptista porta and others who deluded perhaps with some chymical surmises have venturd to prescribe the distillation of a water from the tayles of glowormes as a sure way to obtain a liquor shining in the dark to which i shall now add no other example than that afforded us by amber which whilst it remains an intire body is endowd with an electrical faculty of drawing to it self fethers strawes and such like bodies which i never could observe either in its salt its spirit its oyle or in the body i remember i once made by the reunion of its divided elements none of these having such a texture as the intire concrete and however chymists boldly deduce such and such properties from this or that proportion of their component principles yet in concretes that abound with this or that ingredient tis not alwayes so much by vertue of its presence nor its plenty that the concrete is qualifyd to perform such and such effects as upon the account of the particular texture of that and the other ingredients associated after a determinate manner into one concrete though possibly such a proportion of that ingredient may be more convenient than an other for the constituting of such a body thus in a clock the hand is movd upon the dyal the bell is struck and the other actions belonging to the engine are performd not because the wheeles are of brass or iron or part of one metal and part of another or because the weights are of lead but by vertue of the size shape bigness and coaptation of the several parts which would performe the same things though the wheels were of silver or lead or wood and the weights of stone or clay provided the fabrick or contrivance of the engine were the same though it be not to be denyd that brasse and steel are more convenient materials to make clockwheels of than lead or wood and to let you see eleutherius that tis sometimes at least upon the texture of the small parts of a body and not alwaies upon the presence or recesse or increase or decrement of any one of its principle that it may lose some such qualities and acquire some such others as are thought very strongly inherent to the bodies they reside in errata in i will add to what may from my past discourse be referd to this purpose this notable example from my own experience that lead may without any additament and only by various applications of the fire lose its colour and acquire sometimes a gray sometimes a yellowish sometimes a red sometimes an amethihstine transcribers note amethistine colour and after having past through these and perhaps divers others again recover its leaden colour and be made a bright body that also this lead which is so flexible a metal may be made as brittle as glasse and presently be brought to be again flexible and malleable as before and besides that the same lead which i find by microscopes to be one of the most opacous bodies in the world may be reduced to a fine transparent glasse whence yet it may returne to an opacous nature again and all this as i said without the addition of any extraneous body and meerly by the manner and method of exposing it to the fire but sayes carneades after having already put you to so prolix a trouble it is time for me to relieve you with a promise of putting speedily a period to it and to make good that promise i shall from all that i have hitherto discoursed with you deduce but this one proposition by way of corollary that it may as yet be doubted whether or no there be any determinate number of elements or if you please whether or no all compound bodies do consist of the same number of elementary ingredients or material principles this being but an inference from the foregoing discourse it will not be requisite to insist at large on the proofs of it but only to point at the chief of them and referr you for particulars to what has been already delivered in the first place then from what has been so largely discoursd it may appear that the experiments wont to be brought whether by the common peripateticks or by the vulgar chymists to demonstrate that all mixt bodies are made up precisely either of the four elements or the three hypostatical principles do not evince what they are alledgd to prove and as for the other common arguments pretended to be drawn from reason in favour of aristotelian hypothesis for the chymists are wont to rely almost altogether upon experiments they are commonly grounded upon such unreasonable or precarious suppositions that tis altogether as easie and as just for any man to reject them as for those that take them for granted to assert them being indeed all of them as indemonstrable as the conclusion to be inferrd from them and some of them so manifestly weak and prooflesse that he must be a very courteous adversary that can be willing to grant them and as unskilful a one that can be compelled to do so in the next place it may be considered if what those patriarchs of the spagyrists paracelsus and helmont do on divers occasions positively deliver be true namely that the alkahest does resolve all mixt bodies into other principles than the fire it must be decided which of the two resolutions that made by the alkahest or that made by the fire shall determine the number of the elements before we can be certain how many there are and in the mean time we may take notice in the last place that as the distinct substances whereinto the alkahest divides bodies are affirmd to be differing in nature from those whereunto they are wont to be reducd by fire and to be obtaind from some bodies more in number than from some others since he tells us he could totally reduce all sorts of stones into salt only whereas of a coal he had two distinct liquors29 so although we should acquiesce in that resolution which is made by fire we find not that all mixt bodies are thereby divided into the same number of elements and principles some concretes affordding more of them than others do nay and sometimes this or that body affording a greater number of differing substances by one way of management than the same yields by another and they that out of gold or mercury or muscovyglasse will draw me as many distinct substances as i can separate from vitriol or from the juice of grapes variously orderd may teach me that which i shall very thankfully learn nor does it appear more congruous to that variety that so much conduceth to the perfection of the universe that all elemented bodies be compounded of the same number of elements then it would be for a language that all its words should consist of the same number of letters footnote 29 novi saxum lapides omnes in merum salem suo saxo aut lapidi quiponderantem reducere absque omni prorsus sulphure aut mercurio helmont pag 409 the sceptical chymist or a paradoxical appendix to the foregoing treatise the sixth part here carneades having dispacht what he thought requisite to oppose against what the chymists are wont to alledge for proof of their three principles pausd awhile and lookd about him to discover whether it were time for him and his friend to rejoyne the rest of the company but eleutherius perceiving nothing yet to forbid them to prosecute their discourse a little further said to his friend who had likewise taken notice of the same thing i halfe expected carneades that after you had so freely declard your doubting whether there be any determinate number of elements you would have proceeded to question whether there be any elements at all and i confess it will be a trouble to me if you defeat me of my expectation especially since you see the leasure we have allowd us may probably suffice to examine that paradox because you have so largly deducd already many things pertinent to it that you need but intimate how you would have them applyd and what you would inferr from them carneades having in vain represented that their leasure could be but very short that he had already prated very long that he was unprepared to maintain so great and so invidious a paradox was at length prevaild with to tell his friend since eleutherius you will have me discourse ex tempore of the paradox you mention i am content though more perhaps to express my obedience then my opinion to tell you that supposing the truth of helmonts and paracelsuss alkahestical experiments if i may so call them though it may seem extravagant yet it is not absurd to doubt whether for ought has been provd there be a necessity to admit any elements or hypostatical principles at all and as formerly so now to avoid the needless trouble of disputing severally with the aristotelians and the chymists i will address my self to oppose them i have last namd because their doctrine about the elements is more applauded by the moderns as pretending highly to be grounded upon experience and to deal not only fairly but favourably with them i will allow them to take in earth and water to their other principles which i consent to the rather that my discourse may the better reach the tenents of the peripateticks who cannot plead for any so probably as for those two elements that of fire above the air being generally by judicious men exploded as an imaginary thing and the air not concurring to compose mixt bodies as one of their elements but only lodging in their pores or rather replenishing by reason of its weight and fluidity all those cavities of bodies here below whether compounded or not that are big enough to admit it and are not filld up with any grosser substance and to prevent mistakes i must advertize you that i now mean by elements as those chymists that speak plainest do by their principles certain primitive and simple or perfectly unmingled bodies which not being made of any other bodies or of one another are the ingredients of which all those calld perfectly mixt bodies are immediately compounded and into which they are ultimately resolved now whether there be any one such body to be constantly met with in all and each of those that are said to be elemented bodies is the thing i now question by this state of the controversie you will i suppose guess that i need not be so absurd errata absurd as to deny that there are such bodies as earth and water and quicksilver and sulphur but i look upon earth and water as component parts of the universe or rather of the terrestrial globe not of all mixt bodies and though i will not peremptorily deny that there may sometimes either a running mercury or a combustible substance be obtaind from a mineral or even a metal yet i need not concede either of them to be an element in the sence above declard as i shall have occasion to shew you by and by to give you then a brief account of the grounds i intend to proceed upon i must tell you that in matters of philosophy this seems to me a sufficient reason to doubt of a known and important proposition that the truth of it is not yet by any competent proof made to appear and congruously herunto if i shew that the grounds upon which men are perswaded that there are elements are unable to satisfie a considering man i suppose my doubts will appear rational now the considerations that induce men to think that there are elements may be conveniently enough referrd to two heads namely the one that it is necessary that nature make use of elements to constitute the bodies that are reputed mixt and the other that the resolution of such bodies manifests that nature had compounded them of elementary ones in reference to the former of these considerations there are two or three things that i have to represent and i will begin with reminding you of the experiments i not long since related to you concerning the growth of pompions mint and other vegetables out of fair water for by those experiments its seems evident that water may be transmuted into all the other elements from whence it may be inferrd both that tis not every thing chymists will call salt sulphur or spirit that needs alwayes be a primordiate and ingenerable body and that nature may contex a plant though that be a perfectly mixt concrete without having all the elements previously presented to her to compound it of and if you will allow the relation i mentiond out of mounsieur de rochas to be true then may not only plants but animals and minerals too be produced out of water and however there is little doubt to be made but that the plants my tryals afforded me as they were like in so many other respects to the rest of the plants of the same denomination so they would in case i had reducd them to putrefaction have likewise producd wormes or other insects as well as the resembling vegetables are wont to do so that water may by various seminal principles be successively transmuted into both plants and animals and if we consider that not only men but even sucking children are but too often tormented with solid stones but that divers sorts of beasts themselves whatever helmont against experience think to the contrary may be troubled with great and heavy stones in their kidneys and bladders though they feed but upon grass and other vegetables that are perhaps but disguised water it will not seem improbable that even some concretes of a mineral nature may likewise be formd of water we may further take notice that as a plant may be nourisht and consequently may consist of common water so may both plants and animals perhaps even from their seminal rudiments consist of compound bodies without having any thing meerly elementary brought them by nature to be compounded by them this is evident in divers men who whilst they were infants were fed only with milk afterwards live altogether upon flesh fish wine and other perfectly mixt bodies it may be seen also in sheep who on some of our english downs or plains grow very fat by feeding upon the grasse without scarce drinking at all and yet more manifestly in the magots that breed and grow up to their full bignesse within the pulps of apples pears or the like fruit we see also that dungs that abound with a mixt salt give a much more speedy increment to corn and other vegetables than water alone would do and it hath been assurd me by a man experiencd in such matters that sometimes when to bring up roots very early the mould they were planted in was made overrich the very substance of the plant has tasted of the dung and let us also consider a graft of one kind of fruit upon the upper bough of a tree of another kind as for instance the ciens of a pear upon a whitethorne for there the ascending liquor is already alterd either by the root or in its ascent by the bark or both wayes and becomes a new mixt body as may appear by the differing qualities to be met with in the saps of several trees as particularly the medicinal vertue of the birchwater which i have sometimes drunk upon helmonts great and not undeserved commendation now the graft being fastend to the stock must necessarily nourish its self and produce its fruit only out of this compound juice prepared for it by the stock being unable to come at any other aliment and if we consider how much of the vegetable he feeds upon may as we noted above remain in an animal we may easily suppose that the blood of that animal who feeds upon this though it be a well constituted liquor and have all the differing corpuscles that make it up kept in order by one prsiding form may be a strangely decompounded body many of its parts being themselves decompounded so little is it necessary that even in the mixtures which nature her self makes in animal and vegetable bodies she should have pure elements at hand to make her compositions of having said thus much touching the constitution of plants and animals i might perhaps be able to say as much touching that of minerals and even metalls if it were as easy for us to make experiment in order to the production of these as of those but the growth or increment of minerals being usually a work of excessively long time and for the most part performd in the bowels of the earth where we cannot see it i must instead of experiments make use on this occasion of observations that stones were not all made at once but that are some of them now adayes generated may though it be denyd by some be fully provd by several examples of which i shall now scarce alledg any other then that famous place in france known by the name of les caves gentieres errata goutieres where the water falling from the upper parts of the cave to the ground does presently there condense into little stones of such figures as the drops falling either severally or upon one another and coagulating presently into stone chance to exhibit of these stones some ingenuous friends of ours that went a while since to visit that place did me the favour to present me with some that they brought thence and i remember that both that sober relator of his voyages van linschoten and another good author inform us that in the diamond mines as they call them in the eastindies when having digd the earth though to no great depth they find diamonds and take them quite away yet in a very few years they find in the same place new diamonds producd there since from both which relations especially the first it seems probable that nature does not alwayes stay for divers elementary bodies when she is to produce stones and as for metals themselves authors of good note assure us that even they were not in the beginning producd at once altogether but have been observd to grow so that what was not a mineral or metal before became one afterwards of this it were easie to alledg many testimonies of professed chymists but that they may have the greater authority i shall rather present you with a few borrowed from more unsuspected writers sulphuris mineram as the inquisitive p fallopius notes qu nutrix est caloris subterranei fabri seu archi fontium mineralium infra terram citissime renasci testantur histori metallic sunt enim loca e quibus si hoc anno sulphur effossum fuerit intermissa fossione per quadriennium redeunt fossores omnia sulphure ut autea errata antea rursus inveniunt plena pliny relates in itali insula ilva gigni ferri metallum strabo multo expressius effossum ibi metallum semper regenerari nam si effossio spatio centum annorum intermittebatur iterum illuc revertebantur fossores reperisse maximam copiam ferri regeneratam which history not only is countenanced by fallopius from the incom which the iron of that island yielded the duke of florence in his time but is mentiond more expressely to our purpose by the learned cesalpinus vena sayes he ferri copiosissima est in italia ob eam nobilitata ilva tirrheni maris insula incredibili copia etiam nostris temporibus eam gignens nam terra qu eruitur dum vena effoditur tota procedente tempore in venam convertitur which last clause is therefore very notable because from thence we may deduce that earth by a metalline plastick principle latent in it may be in processe of time changd into a metal and even agricola himself though the chymists complain of him as their adversary acknowledges thus much and more by telling us that at a town called saga in germany30 they dig up iron in the fields by sinking ditches two foot deep and adding that within the space of ten years the ditches are digged again for iron since produced as the same metal is wont to be obtaind in elva also concerning lead not to mention what even galen notes that it will increase both in bulk and weight if it be long kept in vaults or sellars where the air is gross and thick as he collects from the smelling of those pieces of lead that were imployd to fasten together the parts of old statues not to mention this i say boccacius certaldus as i find him quoted by a diligent writer has this passage touching the growth of lead fessularum mons sayes he in hetruria florenti civitati imminens lapides plumbarios habet qui si excidantur brevi temporis spatio novis incrementis instaurantur ut annexes my author tradit boccacius certaldus qui id compotissimum errata compertissimum esse scribit nihil

dictis ad asylum recrementa congesta in cumulos exposita solibus pluviisque paucis annis redunt suum metallum cum fenore i might add to these continues carneades many things that i have met with concerning the generation of gold and silver but for fear of wanting time i shall mention but two or three narratives the first you may find recorded by gerhardus the physick professor in these words in valle sayes he joachimaca errata joachimica argentum gramini errata graminis modo more e lapidibus miner velut e radice excrevisse digiti longitudine testis est dr schreterus qui ejusmodi venas aspectu jucundas admirabiles domi sua aliis spe monstravit donavit item aqua crulea inventa est anneberg ubi argentum erat adhuc in primo ente qu coagulata redacta est in calcem fixi boni argenti footnote 30 in lygiis ad sagam opidum in pratis eruitur ferrum fossis ad altitudinem bipedaneam actis id decennio renatum denuo foditur non aliter ac ilv ferrum the other two relations i have not met with in latine authours and yet they are both very memorable in themselves and as pertinent to our present purpose the first i meet with in the commentary of johannes valehius upon the kleine baur in which that industrious chymist relates with many circumstances that at a minetown if i may so english the german bergstat eight miles or leagues distant from strasburg calld mariakirch a workman came to the overseer and desired employment but he telling him that there was not any of the best sort at present for him added that till he could be preferrd to some such he might in the mean time to avoid idleness work in a grove or minepit thereabouts which at that time was little esteemd this workman after some weeks labour had by a crack appearing in the stone upon a stroak given near the wall an invitation given him to work his way through which as soon as he had done his eyes were saluted by a mighty stone or lump which stood in the middle of the cleft that had a hollow place behind it upright and in shew like an armedman but consisted of pure fine silver having no vein or ore by it or any other additament but stood there free having only underfoot something like a burnt matter and yet this one lump held in weight above a 1000 marks which according to the dutch account errata dutch account makes 500 pound weight of fine silver from which and other circumstances my author gathers that by the warmth of the place the noble metalline spirits sulphureous and mercurial were carrid from the neighbouring galleries or vaults through other smaller cracks and clefts into that cavity and there collected as in a close chamber or cellar whereinto when they were gotten they did in process of time settle into the forementioned precious mass of metal the other germane relation is of that great traveller and laborious chymist johannes not georgus agricola who in his notes upon what poppius has written of antimony relates that when he was among the hungarian mines in the deep groves he observd that there would often arise in them a warm steam not of that malignant sort which the germains call shwadt which sayes he is a meer poyson and often suffocates the diggers errata diggers which fastend it self to the walls and that coming again to review it after a couple of dayes he discernd that it was all very fast and glistering whereupon having collected it and distilld it per retortam he obtaind from it a fine spirit adding that the minemen informd him that this steam or damp of the english mine errata damp as the englishmen also call it retaining the dutch term would at last have become a metal as gold or silver i referr sayes carneades to another occasion the use that may be made of these narratives towards the explicating the nature of metalls and that of fixtness malleableness and some other qualities conspicuous in them and in the mean time this i may at present deduce from these observations that tis not very probable that whensoever a mineral or even a metall is to be generated in the bowels of the earth nature needs to have at hand both salt and sulphur and mercury to compound it of for not to urge that the two last relations seem less to favour the chymists than aristotle who would have metals generated of certain halitus or steams the forementiond observations together make it seem more likely that the mineral earths or those metalline steams wherewith probably such earths are plentifully imbud do contain in them some seminal rudiment or some thing equivalent thereunto by whose plastick power the rest of the matter though perhaps terrestrial and heavy is in tract of time fashiond into this or that metalline ore almost as i formerly noted that fair water was by the seminal principle of mint pompions and other vegetables contrivd into bodies answerable to such seeds and that such alterations of terrestrial matter are not impossible seems evident from that notable practice of the boylers of saltpetre who unanimously observe as well here in england as in other countries that if an earth pregnant with nitre be deprivd by the affusion of water of all its true and dissoluble salt yet the earth will after some years yield them saltpetre again for which reason some of the eminent and skillfullest of them keep it in heaps as a perpetual mine of salt petre whence it may appear that the seminal principle of nitre latent in the earth does by degrees transforme the neighbouring matter into a nitrous body for though i deny that some volatile nitre may by such earths be attracted as they speak out of the air yet that the innermost parts of such great heaps that lye so remote from the air should borrow from it all the nitre they abound with is not probable for other reasons besides the remoteness of the air though i have not the leasure to mention them and i remember that a person of great credit and well acquainted with the wayes of making vitriol affirmd to me that he had observd that a kind of mineral which abounds in that salt being kept within doors and not exposd as is usual to the free air and rains did of it self in no very long time turn into vitriol not only in the outward or superficial but even in the internal and most central parts and i also remember that i met with a certain kind of merkasite that lay together in great quantities under ground which did even in my chamber in so few hours begin of it self to turne into vitriol that we need not distrust the newly recited narrative but to return to what i was saying of nitre as nature made this saltpetre out of the once almost and inodorous earth it was bred in and did not find a very stinking and corrosive acid liquor and a sharp alcalyzate salt to compound it of though these be the bodies into which the fire dissolves it so it were not necessary that nature should make up all metals and other minerals of preexistent salt and sulphur and mercury though such bodies might by fire be obtained from it which one consideration duly weighd is very considerable in the present controversy and to this agree well the relations of our two german chymists for besides that it cannot be convincingly provd it is not so much as likely that so languid and moderate a heat as that within the mines should carry up to so great a heat errata height though in the forme of fumes salt sulphur and mercury since we find in our distillations that it requires a considerable degree of fire to raise so much as to the height of one foot not only salt but even mercury it self in close vessels and if it be objected that it seems by the stink that is sometimes observd when lightening falls down here below that sulphureous steams may ascend very high without any extraordinary degree of heat it may be answerd among other things that the sulphur of silver is by chymists said to be a fixt sulphur though not altogether so well digested as that of gold but proceeds carneades if it had not been to afford you some hints concerning the origine of metals i need not have deducd any thing from these observations it not being necessary to the validity of my argument that my deductions from them should be irrefragable because my adversaries the aristotelians and vulgar chymists do not i presume know any better then i a priori of what ingredients nature compounds metals and minerals for their argument to prove that those bodies are made up of such principles is drawn a posteriori i mean from this that upon the analysis of mineral bodies they are resolvd into those differing substances that we may therefore examine this argument let us proceed to consider what can be alledgd in behalf of the elements from the resolutions of bodies by the fire which you remember was the second tophick transcribers note topick whence i told you the arguments of my adversaries were desumd and that i may first dispatch what i have to say concerning minerals i will begin the remaining part of my discourse with considering how the fire divides them and first i have partly noted above that though chymists pretend from some to draw salt from others running mercury and from others a sulphur yet they have not hitherto taught us by any way in us errata use among them to separate any one principle whether salt sulphur or mercury from all sorts of minerals without exception and thence i may be allowd to conclude that there is not any of the elements that is an ingredient of all bodies since there are some of which it is not so in the next place supposing that either sulphur or mercury were obtainable from all sorts of minerals yet still this sulphur or mercury would be but a compounded not an elementary body as i told you already on another occasion and certainly he that takes notice of the wonderful operations of quicksilver whether it be common or drawn from mineral bodies can scarce be so inconsiderate as to think it of the very same nature with that immature and fugitive substance which in vegetables and animals chymists have been pleasd to call their mercury so that when mercury is got by the help of the fire out of a metal or other mineral body if we will not suppose that it was not preexistent in it but producd by the action of the fire upon the concrete we may at least suppose this quicksilver to have been a perfect body of its own kind though perhaps lesse heterogeneous then more secundary mixts which happend to be mingld per minima and coagulated with the other substances whereof the metal or mineral consisted as may be exemplyfied partly by native vermillion wherein the quicksilver and sulphur being exquisitely blended both with one another and that other course mineral stuff what ever it be that harbours them make up a red body differing enough from both and yet from which part of the quicksilver and of the sulphur may be easily enough obtaind partly by those mines wherein nature has so curiously incorporated silver with lead that tis extreamly difficult and yet possible to separate the former out of the latter errata latter and partly too by native vitriol wherein the metalline corpuscles are by skill and industry separable from the saline ones though they be so concoagulated with them that the whole concrete is reckond among salts and here i further observe that i never could see any earth or water properly so calld separated from either gold or silver to name now no other metalline bodies and therefore to retort the argument upon my adversaries i may conclude that since there are some bodies in which for ought appears there is neither earth nor water errata water i may be allowd to conclude that neither of those two is an universal ingredient of all those bodies that are counted perfectly mixt which i desire you would remember against anon it may indeed be objected that the reason why from gold or silver we cannot separate any moisture is because that when it is melted out of the oare the vehement fire requisite to its fusion forcd away all the aqueous and fugitive moisture and the like fire may do from the materials of glass to which i shall answer that i remember i read not long since in the learned josephus acosta31 who relates it upon his own observation that in america where he long lived there is a kind of silver which the indians call papas and sometimes sayes he they find pieces very fine and pure like to small round roots the which is rare in that metal but usuall in gold concerning which metal he tells us that besides this they find some which they call gold in grains which he tells us are small morsels of gold that they find whole without mixture of any other metal which hath no need of melting or refining in the fire footnote 31 acosta natural and moral history of the indies l 3 c 5 p 212 i remember that a very skilful and credible person affirmed to me that being in the hungarian mines he had the good fortune to see a mineral that was there diggd up wherein pieces of gold of the length and also almost of the bigness of a humane finger grew in the oar as if they had been parts and branches of trees and i have my self seen a lump of whitish mineral that was brought as a rarity to a great and knowing prince wherein there grew here and there in the stone which looked like a kind of sparr divers little lumps of fine gold for such i was assured that tryal had manifested it to be some of them seeming to be about the bigness of pease but that is nothing to what our acosta subjoynes which is indeed very memorable namely that of the morsels of native and pure gold which we lately heard him mentioning he had now and then seen some that weighed many pounds32 to which i shall add that i my self have seen a lump of oar not long since digged up in whose stony part there grew almost like trees divers parcels though not of gold yet of what perhaps mineralists will more wonder at another metal which seemed to be very pure or unmixt with any heterogeneous substances and were some of them as big as my finger if not bigger but upon observations of this kind though perhaps i could yet i must not at present dwell any longer footnote 32 see acosta in the forecited place and the passage of pliny quoted by him to proceed therefore now sayes carneades to the consideration of the analysis of vegetables although my tryals give me no cause to doubt but that out of most of them five differing substances may be obtaind by the fire yet i think it will not be so easily demonstrated that these deserve to be calld elements in the notion above explaind and before i descend to particulars i shall repeat and premise this general consideration that these differing substances that are calld elements or principles differ not from each other as metals plants and animals or as such creatures as are immediately producd each by its peculiar seed and constitutes a distinct propagable sort of creatures in the universe but these are only various schemes of matter or substances that differ from each other but in consistence as running mercury and the same metal congeald by the vapor of lead and some very few other accidents as tast or smel or inflamability or the want of them so that by a change of texture not impossible to be wrought by the fire and other agents that have the faculty not only to dissociate the smal parts of bodies but afterwards to connect them after a new manner the same parcell of matter may acquire or lose such accidents as may suffice to denominate it salt or sulphur or earth if i were fully to clear to you my apprehensions concerning this matter i should perhaps be obliged to acquaint you with divers of the conjectures for i must yet call them no more i have had concerning the principles of things purely corporeal for though because i seem not satisfid with the vulgar doctrines either of the peripatetick or paracelsian schools many of those that know me and perhaps among them eleutherius himself have thought me wedded to the epicurean hypotheses as others have mistaken me for an helmontian yet if you knew how little conversant i have been with epicurean authors and how great a part of lucretius himself i never yet had the curiosity to read you would perchance be of another mind especially if i were to entertain you at large i say not of my present notions but of my former thoughts concerning the principles of things but as i said above fully to clear my apprehensions would require a longer discourse than we can now have for i should tell you that i have sometimes thought it not unfit that to the principles which may be assignd to things as the world is now constituted we should if we consider the great mass of matter as it was whilst the universe was in making add another which may conveniently enough be calld an architectonick principle or power by which i mean those various determinations and that skilfull guidance of the motions of the small parts of the universal matter by the most wise author of things which were necessary at the beginning to turn that confusd chaos into this orderly and beautifull world and especially to contrive the bodies of animals and plants and the seeds of those things whose kinds were to be propagated for i confess i cannot well conceive how from matter barely put into motion and then left to it self there could emerge such curious fabricks as the bodies of men and perfect animals and such yet more admirably contrivd parcels of matter as the seeds of living creatures i should likewise tell you upon what grounds and in what sence i suspected the principles of the world as it now is to be three matter motion and rest i say as the world now is because the present fabrick of the universe and especially the seeds of things together with the establisht course of nature is a requisite or condition upon whose account divers things may be made out by our three principles which otherwise would be very hard if possible to explicate i should moreover declare in general for i pretend not to be able to do it otherwise not only why i conceive that colours odors tasts fluidness and solidity and those other qualities that diversifie and denominate bodies may intelligibly be deduced from these three but how two of the three epicurean principles which i need not tell you transcribers note tell you are magnitude figure and weight are themselves deducible from matter and motion since the latter of these variously agitating and as it were distracting the former must needs disjoyne its parts which being actually separated must each of them necessarily both be of some size and obtain some shape or other nor did i add to our principles the aristotelean privation partly for other reasons which i must not now stay to insist on and partly because it seems to be rather an antecedent or a terminus a quo then a true principle as the startingpost is none of the horses legs or limbs i should also explain why and how i made rest errata rest to be though not so considerable a principle of things as motion yet a principle of them partly because it is for ought we know errata know as ancient at least as it and depends not upon motion nor any other quality of matter and partly because it may enable the body in which it happens to be both to continue in a state of rest till some external force put it out of that state and to concur to the production of divers changes in the bodies that hit against it by either quite stopping or lessning their motion whilst the body formerly at rest receives all or part of it into it self or else by giving a new byass or some other modification to motion that is to the grand and primary instrument whereby nature produces all the changes and other qualities that are to be met with in the world i should likewise after all this explain to you how although matter motion and rest seemd to me to be the catholick principles of the universe i thought the principles of particular bodies might be commodiously enough reducd to two namely matter and what comprehends the two other and their effects the result or aggregate errata aggregate or complex of those accidents which are the motion or rest for in some bodies both are not to be found the bigness figure texture errata delete and the thence resulting qualities of the small parts errata delete which are necessary to intitle the body whereto they belong to this or that peculiar denomination and discriminating it from others to appropriate it to a determinate kind of things as errata as yellowness fixtness such a degree of weight and of ductility do make the portion of matter wherein they concur to be reckond among perfect metals and obtain the name of gold which errata this aggregate or result of accidents you may if you please call either structure or texture errata no paragraph break though errata though indeed that do not so properly comprehend the motion of the constituent parts especially in case some of them be fluid errata fluid or what other appellation shall appear most expressive or if retaining the vulgar terme you will call it the forme of the thing it denominates i shall not much oppose it provided the word be interpreted to mean but what i have expressd and not a scholastick substantial forme which so many intelligent men profess to be to them altogether unintelligible but sayes carneades if you remember that tis a sceptick speaks to you and that tis not so much my present talk to make assertions as to suggest doubts i hope you will look upon what i have proposd rather as a narrative of my former conjectures touching the principles of things then as a resolute declaration of my present opinions of them especially since although they cannot but appear very much to their disadvantage if you consider them as they are proposd without those reasons and explanations by which i could perhaps make them appear much lesse extravagant yet i want time to offer you what may be alledgd to clear and countenance these notions my design in mentioning them unto you at present being partly to bring some light and confirmation to divers passages of my discourse to you partly to shew you that i do not as you seem to have suspected embrace all epicurus his principles but dissent from him in some main things as well as from aristotle and the chymists in others partly also or rather chiefly to intimate to you the grounds upon which i likewise differ from helmont in this that whereas he ascribes almost all things and even diseases themselves to their determinate seeds i am of opinion that besides the peculiar fabricks of the bodies of plants and animals and perhaps also of some metals and minerals which i take to be the effects of seminal principles there are many other bodies in nature which have and deserve distinct and proper names but yet do but result from such contextures of the matter they are made of as may without determinate seeds be effected by heat cold artificial mixtures and compositions and divers other causes which sometimes nature imployes of her own accord and oftentimes man by his power and skill makes use of to fashion the matter according to his intentions this may be exemplified both in the productions of nature and in those of art of the first sort i might name multitudes but to shew how sleight a variation of textures without addition of new ingredients may procure a parcel of matter divers names and make it be lookt upon as different things i shall invite you to observe with me that clouds rain hail snow froth and ice may be but water having its parts varyed as to their size and distance in respect of each other and as to motion and rest and among artificial productions we may take notice to skip the crystals of tartar of glass regulus martisstellatus errata regulus martis stellatus and particularly of the sugar of lead which though made of that insipid metal and sour salt of vinager has in it a sweetnesse surpassing that of common sugar and divers other qualities which being not to be found in either of its two ingredients must be confessd to belong to the concrete it self upon the account of its texture this consideration premisd it will be i hope the more easie to perswade you that the fire may as well produce some new textures in a parcel of matter as destroy the old wherefore hoping that you have not forgot the arguments formerly imployd against the doctrine of the tria prima namely that the salt sulphur and mercury into which the fire seems to resolve vegetable and animal bodies are yet compounded not simple and elementary substances and that as appeared by the experiment of pompions the tria prima may be made out of water hoping i say that you remember these and the other things that i formerly represented to the same purpose i shall now add only that if we doubt not the truth of some of helmonts relation errata relations we may well doubt whether any of these heterogeneities be i say not preexistent so as to convene together when a plant or animal is to be constituted but so much as inexistent in the concrete whence they are obtaind when the chymists errata chymist first goes about to resolve it for not to insist upon the uninflamable spirit of such concretes because that may be pretended to be but a mixture of phlegme and salt the oyle or sulphur of vegetables or animals is according to him reducible by the help of lixiviate salts into sope as that sope is by the help of repeated distillations from a caput mortuum of chalk into insipid water and as for the saline substance that seems separable from mixt bodies the same helmonts tryals33 give us cause to think that it may be a production of the fire which by transporting and otherwise altering the particles of the matter does bring it to a saline nature footnote 33 omne autem alcali addita pinguedine in aqueum liquorem qui tandem mera simplex aqua fit reducitur ut videre est in sapone lazurio lapide c quoties per adjuncta fixa semen pinguedinis deponit helmont for i know sayes he in the place formerly alledgd to another purpose a way to reduce all stones into a meer salt of equal weight with the stone whence it was producd and that without any of the least either sulphur or mercury which asseveration of my author would perhaps seem less incredible to you if i durst acquaint you with all i could say upon that subject and hence by the way you may also conclude that the sulphur and mercury as they call them that chymists are wont to obtain from compound bodies by the fire may possibly in many cases be the productions of it since if the same bodies had been wrought upon by the agents employd by helmont they would have yielded neither sulphur nor mercury and those portions of them which the fire would have presented us in the forme of sulphureous and mercurial bodies would have by helmonts method been exhibited to us in the form of salt but though sayes eleutherius you have alledgd very plausible arguments against the tria prima yet i see not how it will be possible for you to avoid acknowledging that earth and water are elementary ingredients though not of mineral concretes yet of all animal and vegetable bodies since if any of these of what sort soever be committed to distillation there is regularly and constantly separated from it a phlegme or aqueous part and a caput mortuum or earth i readily acknowledged answers carneades it is not so easy to reject water and earth and especially the former as tis to reject the tria prima from being the elements of mixt bodies but tis not every difficult thing that is impossible i consider then as to water that the chief qualities which make men give that name to any visible substance are that it is fluid or liquid and that it is insipid and inodorous now as for the tast of these qualities i think you have never seen any of those separated substances that the chymists call phlegme which was perfectly devoyd both of tast and smell and if you object that yet it may be reasonably supposd that since the whole body is liquid the mass is nothing but elementary water faintly imbud with some of the saline or sulphureous parts of the same concrete which it retaind with it upon its separation from the other ingredients to this i answer that this objection would not appear so stong transcribers note strong as it is plausible if chymists understood the nature of fluidity and compactnesse and that as i formerly observd to a bodies being fluid there is nothing necessary but that it be divided into parts small enough and that these parts be put into such a motion among themselves as to glide some this way and some that way along each others surfaces so that although a concrete were never so dry and had not any water or other liquor inexistent in it yet such a comminution of its parts may be made by the fire or other agents as to turn a great portion of them into liquor of this truth i will give an instance employd by our friend here present as one of the most conducive of his experiments to illustrate the nature of salts if you take then sea salt and melt it in the fire to free it from the aqueous parts and afterward distill it with a vehement fire from burnt clay or any other as dry a caput mortuum as you please you will as chymists confess errata confesse delete comma by teaching it drive over a good part of the salt in the form of a liquor and to satisfy some ingenious men that a great part of this liquor was still true sea salt brought by the operation of the fire into corpuscles so small and perhaps so advantageously shapd as to be capable of the forme of a fluid body he did in my presence poure to such spiritual salts a due proportion of the spirit or salt and phlegme of urine whereby having evaporated the superfluous moisture he soon obtaind such another concrete both as to tast and smell and easie sublimableness as common salt armoniack which you know is made up of grosse and undistilld sea salt united with the salts of urine and of soot which two are very neer of kin to each other and further to manifest that the corpuscles of sea salt and the saline ones of urine retain their several natures in this concrete he mixt it with a convenient quantity of salt of tartar and committing it to distillation soon regaind his spirit of urine in a liquid form by its self the sea salt staying behind with the salt of tartar wherefore it is very possible that dry bodies may by the fire be reducd to liquors without any separation of elements but barely by a certain kind of dissipation and comminution of the matter whereby its parts are brought into a new state and if it be still objected that the phlegme of mixt bodies must be reputed water because so weak a tast needs but a very small proportion of salt to impart it it may be replyd that for ought appears common salt and divers other bodies though they be distilld never so dry and in never so close vessels will yield each of them pretty store of a liquor wherein though as i lately noted saline corpuscles abound yet there is besides a large proportion of phlegme as may easily be discovered by coagulating the saline corpuscles with any convenient body as i lately told you our friend coagulated part of the spirit of salt with spirit of urine and as i have divers times separated a salt from oyle of vitriol it self though a very ponderous liquor and drawn from a saline body by boyling it with a just quantity of mercury and then washing the newly coagulated salt from the precipitate with fair water now to what can we more probably ascribe this plenty of aqueous substance afforded us by the distillation of such bodies than unto this that among the various operations of the fire upon the matter of a concrete divers particles of that matter are reducd to such a shape and bignesse as is requisite to compose such a liquor as chymists are wont to call phlegme or water how i conjecture this change may be effected tis neither necessary for me to tell you nor possible to do so without a much longer discourse then were now seasonable but i desire you would with me reflect upon what i formerly told you concerning the change of quicksilver into water for that water having but a very faint tast if any whit more than divers of those liquors that chymists referr to phlegme by that experiment it seems evident that even a metalline body and therefore much more such as are but vegetable or animal may by a simple operation of the fire be turnd in great part into water and since those i dispute with are not yet able out of gold or silver or divers other concretes to separate any thing like water i hope i may be allowd to conclude against them that water it self is not an universal and preexistent ingredient of mixt bodies but as for those chymists that supposing with me the truth of what helmont relates of the alkahests wonderful effects have a right to press me with his authority concerning them and to alledge that he could transmute all reputedly mixt bodies into insipid and meer water to those i shall represent that though his affirmations conclude strongly against the vulgar chymists against whom i have not therefore scrupld to employ them since they evince that the commonly reputed principles or ingredients of things are not permanent and indestructible since they may be further reducd into insipid phlegme differing from them all yet till we can be allowd to examine this liquor i think it not unreasonable to doubt whether it be not something else then meer water for i find not any other reason given by helmont of his pronouncing it so then that it is insipid now sapour being an accident or an affection of matter that relates to our tongue palate and other organs of tast it may very possibly be that the small parts of a body may be of such a size and shape as either by their extream littleness or by their slenderness or by their figure to be unable to pierce into and make a perceptible impression upon the nerves or membranous parts of the organs of tast and what errata yet may be fit to work otherwise upon divers other bodies than meer water can and consequently to disclose it self to be of a nature farr enough from elementary in silke dyed red or of any other colour whilst many contiguous threads makes up a skein the colour of the silke is conspicuous but if only a very few of them be lookt upon the colour will appear much fainter then before but if you take out one simple thread you shall not easily be able to discern any colour at all so subtile an object having not the force to make upon the optick nerve an impression great enough to be taken notice of it is also observd that the best sort of oylolive is almost tastless and yet i need not tell you how exceedingly distant in nature oyle is from water the liquor into which i told you upon the relation of lully and errata an eyewitness that mercury might be transmuted has sometimes but a very languid if any tast and yet its operations even upon some mineral bodies are very peculiar quicksilver it self also though the corpuscles it consists of be so very small as to get into the pores of that closest and compactest of bodies gold is yet you know altogether tastless and our helmont several times tells us that fair water wherein a little quantity f errata of quicksilver has lain for some time though it acquire no certain tast or other sensible quality from the quicksilver yet it has a power to destroy wormes in humane bodies which he does much but not causelessly extoll and i remember a great lady that had been eminent for her beauty in divers courts confessd to me that this insipid liquor was of all innocent washes for the face the best that she ever met with and here let me conclude my discourse concerning such waters or liquors as i have hitherto been examining with these two considerations whereof the first is that by reason of our being wont to drink nothing but wine bear cyder or other strongly tasted liquors there may be in several of these liquors that are wont to pass for insipid phlegme very peculiar and distinct tasts errata distinct tasts though unheeded and perhaps not to be perceivd by us for to omit what naturalists affirm of apes and which probably may be true of divers other animals that they have a more exquisite palate than men among men themselves those that are wont to drink nothing but water may as i have tryd in my self discern very sensibly a great difference of tasts in several waters which one unaccustomed to drink water would take to be all alike insipid and this is the first of my two considerations the other is that it is not impossible that the corpuscles into which a body is dissipated by the fire may by the operation of the same fire have their figures so altered or may be by associations with one another brought into little masses of such a size and shape as not to be fit to make sensible impressions on the tongue and that you may not think such alterations impossible be pleased to consider with me that not only the sharpest spirit of vinager having dissolved as much corall as it can will coagulate with it into a substance which though soluble in water like salt is incomparably less strongly tasted then the vinager was before but what is more considerable though the acid salts that are carried up with quicksilver in the preparation of common sublimate are so sharp that being moistened with water it will corrode some of the metals themselves yet this corrosive sublimate being twice or thrice resublimd with a full proportion of insipid quicksilver constitutes as you know that factitious concrete which the chymists call mercurius dulcis not because it is sweet but because the sharpness of the corrosive salts is so taken away by their combination with the mercurial corpuscles that the whole mixture when it is prepard is judgd to be insipid and thus continues carneades having given you some reasons why i refuse to admit elementary water for a constant ingredient of mixt bodies it will be easie for me to give you an account why i also reject earth for first it may well be suspected that many substances pass among chymists under the name of earth because like it they are dry and heavy and fixt which yet are very farr from an elementary nature this you will not think improbable if you recall to mind what i formerly told you concerning what chymists call the dead earth of things and especially touching the copper to be drawn from the caput mortuum of vitriol and if also you allow me to subjoyn a casual but memorable experiment made by johannes agricola upon the terra damnata of brimstone our author then tells us in his notes upon popius transcribers note poppius that in the year 1621 he made an oyle of sulphur the remaining fces he reverberated in a moderate fire fourteen dayes afterwards he put them well luted up in a wind oven and gave them a strong fire for six hours purposing to calcine the fces to a perfect whiteness that he might make someting transcribers note something else out of them but coming to break the pot he found above but very little fces and those grey and not white but beneath there lay a fine red regulus which he first marvelld at and knew not what to make of being well assured that not the least thing besides the fces of the sulphur came into the pot and that the sulphur it self had only been dissolvd in linseed oyle this regulus he found heavy and malleable almost as lead having causd a goldsmith to draw him a wire of it he found it to be of the fairest copper and so rightly colourd that a jew of prague offerd him a great price for it and of this metal he sayes he had 12 loth or six ounces out of one pound of ashes or fces and this story may well incline us to suspect that since the caput mortuum of the sulphur was kept so long in the fire before it was found to be any thing else then a terra damnata there may be divers other residences of bodies which are wont to pass only for the terrestrial fces of things and therefore to be thrown away as soon as the distillation or calcination of the body that yielded them is ended which yet if they were long and skilfully examind by the fire would appear to be differing from elementary earth and i have taken notice of the unwarrantable forwardness of common chymists to pronounce things useless fces by observing how often they reject the caput mortuum of verdegrease which is yet so farr from deserving that name that not only by strong fires and convenient additaments it may in some hours be reducd into copper but with a certain flux powder i sometimes make for recreation i have in two or three minutes obtaind that metal from it to which i may add that having for tryall sake kept venetian taclk errata talck in no less a heat than that of a glass furnace i found after all the brunt of the fire it had indurd the remaining body though brittle and discolourd had not lost very much of its former bulke and seemd still to be nearer of kin to talck than to meer earth and i remember too that a candid mineralist famous for his skill in trying of oars requesting me one day to procure him a certain american mineral earth of a virtuoso who he thought would not refuse me i enquird of him why he seemd so greedy of it he confessd to me that this gentleman having brought that earth to the publick saymasters and they upon their being unable by any means to bring it to fusion or make it fly away he the relator had procurd a little of it and having tryd it with a peculiar flux separated from it neer a third part of pure gold so great mistakes may be committed in hastily concluding things to be uselesse earth next it may be supposd that as in the resolution of bodies by the fire some of the dissipated parts may by their various occursion occasiond by the heat be brought to stick together so closely as to constitute corpuscles too heavy for the fire to carry away the aggregate of which corpuscles is wont to be calld ashes or earrh errata earth so other agents may resolve the concrete into minute parts after so differing a manner as not to produce any caput mortuum or dry and heavy body as you may remember helmont above informd us that with his great dissolvent he divided a coal into two liquid and volatile bodies quiponderant to the coal without any dry or fixt residence at all and indeed i see not why it should be necessary that all agents that resolve bodies into portions of differingly qualifid matter must work on them the same way and divide them into just such parts both for nature and number as the fire dissipates them into for since as i noted before the bulk and shape of the small parts of bodies together with their fitness and unfitness to be easily put into motion may make the liquors or other substances such corpuscles compose as much to differ from each other as do some of the chymical principles why may not something happen in this case not unlike what is usuall in the grosser divisions of bodies by mechanical instruments where we see that some tools reduce wood for instance into darts errata parts of several shapes bignesse and other qualities as hatchets and wedges divide it into grosser parts some more long and slender as splinters and some more thick and irregular as chips but all of considerable bulk but files and saws makes a comminution of it into dust which as all the others is of the more solid sort of parts whereas others divide it into long and broad but thin and flexible parts as do planes and of this kind of parts it self there is also a variety according to the difference of the tools employd to work on the wood the shavings made by the plane being in some things differing from those shives or thin and flexible pieces of wood that are obtaind by borers and these from some others obtainable by other tools some chymical examples applicable to this purpose i have elsewhere given you to which i may add that whereas in a mixture of sulphur and salt of tartar well melted and incorporated together the action of pure spirit of wine digested on it is to separate the sulphureous from the alcalizate parts by dissolving the former and leaving the latter the action of wine probably upon the score of its copious phlegme upon the same mixture is to divide it into corpuscles consisting of both alcalizate and sulphureous parts united and if it be objected that this is but a factitious concrete i answer that however the instance may serve to illustrate what i proposd if not to prove it and that nature her self doth in the bowels of the earth make decompounded bodies as we see in vitriol cinnaber and even in sulphur it self i will not urge that the fire divides new milk into five differing substances but runnet and acid liquors divide it into a coagulated matter and a thin whey and on the other side churning divides it into butter and buttermilk which may either of them be yet reducd to other substances differing from the former i will not presse this i say nor other instances of this nature because i cannot in few words answer what may be objected that these concretes sequestred without the help of the fire may by it be further divided into hypostatical principles but i will rather represent that whereas the same spirit of wine will dissociare transcribers note dissociate the parts of camphire and make them one liquor with it self aqua fortis will also disjoyn them and put them into motion but so as to keep them together and yet alter their texture into the form of an oyle i know also an uncompounded liquor that an extraordinary chymist would not allow to be so much as saline which doth as i have tryd from coral it self as fixt as divers judicious writers assert that concrete to be not only obtain a noble tincture without the intervention of nitre or other salts but will carry over the tincture in distillation and if some reasons did not forbid me i could now tell you of a menstruum i make my self that doth more odly dissociate the parts of minerals very fixt in the fire so that it seems not incredible that there may be some agent or way of operation found whereby this or that concrete if not all firme bodies may be resolvd into parts so very minute and so unapt to stick close to one another that none of them may be fixt enough to stay behind in a strong fire and to be incapable of distillation nor consequently to be lookd upon as earth but to return to helmont the same authour somewhere supplys me with another argument against the earths being such an element as my adversaries would have it for he somewhere affirms that he can reduce all the terrestrial parts of mixt bodies into insipid water whence we may argue against the earths being one of their elements even from that notion of elements which you may remember philoponus recited out of aristotle himself when he lately disputed for his chymists against themistius and here we may on this occasion consider that since a body from which the fire hath driven away its looser parts is wont to be lookd upon as earth upon the account of its being endowd with both these qualities tastlessenesse and fixtnesse for salt of tartar though fixt passes not among the chymists for earth because tis strongly tasted if it be in the power of natural agents to deprive the caput mortuum of a body of either of those two qualities or to give them both to a portion of matter that had them not both before the chymists will not easily define what part of a resolvd concrete is earth and make out that that earth is a primary simple and indestructible body now there are some cases wherein the more skilful of the vulgar chymists themselves pretend to be able by repeated cohobations and other fit operations to make the distilled parts of a concrete bring its own caput mortuum over the helme in the forme of a liquor in which state being both fluid and volatile you will easily believe it would not be taken for earth and indeed by a skilful but not vulgar way of managing some concretes there may be more effected in this kind then you perhaps would easily think and on the other side that either earth may be generated or at least bodies that did not before appear to be neer totally earth may be so alterd as to pass for it seems very possible if helmont34 have done that by art which he mentions in several places especially where he sayes that he knowes wayes whereby sulphur once dissolvd is all of it fixd into a terrestrial powder and the whole bodie of saltpetre may be turnd into earth which last he elsewhere sayes is done by the odour only of a certain sulphureous fire and in another place he mentions one way of doing this which i cannot give you an account of because the materialls i had prepard for trying it were by a servants mistake unhappily thrown away footnote 34 novi item modos quibus totum salpeti errata salpetr in terram convertitur totumque sulphur semel dissolutum fixetur in pulvearem terreum helmont in compl atque mist elementor sect 24 and these last arguments may be confirmd by the experiment i have often had occasion to mention concerning the mint i producd out of water and partly by an observation of rondeletius concerning the growth of animals also nourishd but by water which i rememberd not to mention when i discoursd to you about the production of things out of water this diligent writer then in his instructive book of fishes35 affirmes that his wife kept a fish in a glass of water without any other food for three years in which space it was constantly augmented till at last it could not come out of the place at which it was put in and at length was too big for the glass it self though that were of a large capacity and because there is no just reason to doubt that this fish if distilld would have yielded the like differing substances with other animals and however because the mint which i had out of water afforded me upon distillation a good quantity of charcoal i think i may from thence inferr that earth it self may be producd out of water or if you please that water may be transmuted into earth and consequently that though it could be provd that earth is an ingredient actually inexistent in the vegetable and animal bodies whence it may be obtaind by fire yet it would not necessarily follow that earth as a preexistent element does with other principles convene to make up those bodies whence it seems to have been separated footnote 35 lib 1 cap 2 after all is said sayes eleutherius i have yet something to object that i cannot but think considerable since carneades himself alledgd it as such for continues eleutherius smiling i must make bold to try whether you can as luckily answer your own arguments as those of your antagonists i mean pursues he that part of your concessions wherein you cannot but remember that you supplyd your adversaries with an example to prove that there may be elementary bodies by taking notice that gold may be an ingredient in a multitude of differing mixtures and yet retain its nature notwithstanding all that the chymists by their fires and corrosive waters are able to do to destroy it i sufficiently intimated to you at that time replies carneades that i proposd this example chiefly to shew you how nature may be conceived to have made elements not to prove that she actually has made any and you know that a posse ad esse the inference will not hold but continues carneades to answer more directly to the objection drawn from gold i must tell you that though i know very well that divers of the more sober chymists have complaind of the vulgar chymists as of mountebanks or cheats for pretending so vainly as hitherto they have done to destroy gold yet i know a certain menstruum which our friend has made and intends shortly to communicate to the ingenious of so piercing and powerfull a quality that if notwithstanding much care and some skill i did not much deceive myself i have with it really destroyd even refind gold and brought it into a metalline body of another colour and nature as i found by tryals purposely made and if some just considerations did not for the present forbid it i could perchance here shew you by another experiment or two of my own trying that such menstruums may be made as to entice away and retain divers parts from bodies which even the more judicious and experiencd spagyrists have pronouncd irresoluble by the fire though which i desire you would mark in neither of these instances the gold or precious stones be analysd into any of the tria prima but only reducd to new concretes and indeed there is a great disparity betwixt the operations of the several agents whereby the parts of a body come to be dissipated as if for instance you dissolve the purer sort of vitriol in common water the liquor will swallow up the mineral and so dissociate its corpuscles that they will seem to make up but one liquor with those of the water and yet each of these corpuscles retains its nature and texture and remains a vitriolate and compounded body but if the same vitriol be exposed to a strong fire it will then be divided not only as before into smaller parts but into heterogeneous substances each of the vitriolate corpuscles that remaind entire in the water being it self upon the destruction of its former texture dissipated or divided into new particles of differing qualities but instances more fitly applicable to this purpose i have already given you wherefore to return to what i told you about the destruction of gold that experiment invites me to represent to you that though there were either saline or sulphureous or terrestrial portions of matter whose parts were so small so firmly united together or of a figure so fit to make them cohere to one another as we see that in quicksilver broken into little globes the parts brought to touch one another do immediately reimbody that neither the fire nor the usual agents employd by chymists are pierceing enough to divide their parts so as to destroy the texture of the single corpuscles yet it would not necessarily follow that such permanent bodies were elementary since tis possible there may be agents found in nature some of whose parts may be of such a size and figure as to take better hold of some parts of these seemingly elementary corpuscles than these parts do of the rest and consequently may carry away such parts with them and so dissolve the texture of the corpuscle by pulling its parts asunder and if it be said that at least we may this way discover the elementary ingredients of things by observing into what substances these corpuscles that were reputed pure are divided i answer that it is not necessary that such a discovery should be practicable for if the particles of the dissolvent do take such firme hold of those of the dissolved body they must constitute together new bodies as well as destroy the old and the strickt union which according to this hypothesis may well be supposd betwixt the parts of the emergent body will make it as little to be expected that they should be pulld asunder but by little parts of matter that to divide them associate themselves and stick extreamly close to those of them which they sever from their former adherents besides that it is not impossible that a corpuscle supposd to be elementary may have its nature changed without suffering a divorce of its parts barely by a new texture effected by some powerfull agent as i formerly told you the same portion of matter may easily by the operation of the fire be turnd at pleasure into the form of a brittle and transparent or an opacous and malleable body and indeed if you consider how farr the bare change of texture whether made by art or nature or rather by nature with or without the assistance of man can go in producing such new qualities in the same parcel of matter and how many inanimate bodies such as are all the chymical productions of the fire we know are denominated and distinguishd not so much by any imaginary substantial form as by the aggregate of these qualities if you consider these things i say and that the varying of either the figure or the size or the motion or the situation or connexion of the corpuscles whereof any of these bodies is composd may alter the fabrick of it you will possibly be invited to suspect with me that there is no great need that nature should alwayes have elements before hand whereof to make such bodies as we call mixts and that it is not so easie as chymists and others have hitherto imagind to discern among the many differing substances that may without any extraordinary skill be obtaind from the same portion of matter which ought to be esteemed exclusively to all the rest its inexistent elementary ingredients much lesse to determine what primogeneal and simple bodies convened together to compose it to exemplify this i shall add to what i have already on several occasions represented but this single instance you may remember eleutherius that i formerly intimated to you that besides mint and pompions i produced divers other vegetables of very differing natures out of water wherefore you will not i presume think it incongruous to suppose that when a slender vineslip is set into the ground and takes root there it may likewise receive its nutriment from the water attracted out of the earth by his roots or impelld by the warmth of the sun or pressure of the ambient air into the pores of them and this you will the more easily believe if you ever observd what a strange quantity of water will drop out of a wound given to the vine in a convenient place at a seasonable time in the spring and how little of tast or smell this aqua vitis as physitians call it is endowd with notwithstanding what concoction or alteration it may receive in its passage through the vine to discriminate it from common water supposing then this liquor at its first entrance into the roots of the vine to be common water let us a little consider how many various substances may be obtaind from it though to do so i must repeat somewhat that i had a former occasion to touch upon and first this liquor being digested in the plant and assimilated by the several parts of it is turnd into the wood bark pith leaves c of the vine the same liquor may be further dryd and fashond into vinebuds and these a while after are advanced unto sour grapes which expressd yield verjuice a liquor very differing in several qualities both from wine and other liquors obtainable from the vine these soure grapes being by the heat of the sun concocted and ripened turne to well tasted grapes these if dryd in the sun and distilld afford a ftid oyle and a piercing empyreumatical spirit but not a vinous spirit these dryd grapes or raisins boyld in a convenient proportion of water make a sweet liquor which being betimes distilld afford an oyle and spirit much like those of the raisins themselves if the juice of the grapes be squeezd out and put to ferment it first becomes a sweet and turbid liquor then grows lesse sweet and more clear and then affords in common distillations not an oyle but a spirit which though inflamable like oyle differs much from it in that it is not fat and that it will readily mingle with water i have likewise without addition obtaind in processe of time and by an easie way which i am ready to teach you from one of the noblest sorts of wine pretty store of pure and curiously figured crystals of salt together with a great proportion of a liquor as sweet almost as hony and these i obtained not from must but true and sprightly wine besides the vinous liquor the fermented juice of grapes is partly turned into liquid dregs or leeze and partly into that crust or dry feculancy that is commonly called tartar and this tartar may by the fire be easily divided into five differing substances four of which are not acid and the other not so manifestly acid as the tartar it self the same vinous juice after some time especially if it be not carefully kept degenerates into that very sour liquor called vinegar from which you may obtain by the fire a spirit and a crystalline salt differing enough from the spirit and lixiviate salt of tartar and if you pour the dephlegmd spirit of the vinegar upon the salt of tartar there will be producd such a conflict or ebullition as if there were scarce two more contrary bodies in nature and oftentimes in this vinager you may observe part of the matter to be turned into an innumerable company of swimming animals which our friend having divers years ago observed hath in one of his papers taught us how to discover clearly without the help of a microscope into all these various schemes of matter or differingly qualifyed bodies besides divers others that i purposely forbear to mention may the water that is imbibd by the roots of the vine be brought partly by the formative power of the plant and partly by supervenient agents or causes without the visible concurrence of any extraneous ingredient but if we be allowed to add to the productions of this transmuted water a few other substances we may much encrease the variety of such bodies although in this second sort of productions the vinous parts seem scarce to retain any thing of the much more fixd bodies wherewith they were mingld but only to have by their mixture with them acquird such a disposition that in their recess occasiond by the fire they came to be alterd as to shape or bigness or both and associated after a new manner thus as i formerly told you i did by the addition of a caput mortuum of antimony and some other bodies unfit for distillation obtain from crude tartar store of a very volatile and crystalline salt differing very much in smell and other qualities from the usuall salts of tartar but sayes eleutherius interrupting him at these words if you have no restraint upon you i would very gladly before you go any further be more particularly informd how you make this volatile salt because you know that such multitudes of chymists have by a scarce imaginable variety of wayes attempted in vain the volatilization of the salt of tartar that divers learned spagyrists speak as if it were impossible to make any thing out of tartar that shall be volatile in a saline forme or as some of them express it in forma sicca i am very farr from thinking answers carneades that the salt i have mentiond is that which paracelsus and helmont mean when they speak of sal tartari volatile and ascribe such great things to it for the salt i speak of falls extreamly short of those virtues not seeming in its tast smel and other obvious qualities to differ very much though something it do differ from salt of hartshorn and other volatile salts drawn from the distilld parts of animals nor have i yet made tryals enough to be sure that it is a pure salt of tartar without participating any thing at all of the nitre or antimony but because it seems more likely to proceed from the tartar than from any of the other ingredients and because the experiment is in it self not ignoble and luciferous enough as shewing a new way to produce a volatile salt contrary to acid salts from bodies that otherwise are observd to yield no such liquor but either only or chiefly acid ones i shall to satisfie you acquaint you before any of my other friends with the way i now use for i have formerly usd some others to make it take then of good antimony saltpetre and tartar of each an equal weight and of quicklime halfe the weight of any one of them let these be powderd and well mingld this done you must have in readiness a long neck or retort of earth which must be placd in a furnace for a naked fire and have at the top of it a hole of a convenient bigness at which you may cast in the mixture and presently stop it up again this vessel being fitted with a large receiver must have fire made under it till the bottom of the sides be red hot and then you must cast in the above prepard mixture by about halfe a spoonfull more or less at a time at the hole made for that purpose which being nimbly stopt the fumes will pass into the receiver and condense there into a liquor that being rectifid will be of a pure golden colour and carry up that colour to a great height this spirit abounds in the salt i told you of part of which may easily enough be separated by the way i use in such cases which is to put the liquor into a glass egg or bolthead with a long and narrow neck for if this be placd a little inclining in hot sand there will sublime up a fine salt which as i told you i find to be much of kin to the volatile salts of animals for like them it has a saltish not an acid salt it hisses upon the affusion of spirit of nitre or oyle of vitriol it precipitates corals dissolvd in spirit of vinager it turnes the blew syrup of violets immediately green it presently turnes the solution of sublimate into a milkie whiteness and in summ has divers operations like those that i have observd in that sort of salts to which i have resembled it and is so volatile that for distinction sake i call it tartari fugitivus errata sal tartari fugitivus what virtues it may have in physick i have not yet had the opportunity to try but i am apt to think they will not be despicable and besides that a very ingenious friend of mine tells me he hath done great matters against the stone with a preparation not very much differing from ours a very experiencd germane chymist finding that i was unacquainted with the wayes of making this salt told me that in a great city in his country a noted chymist prizes it so highly that he had a while since procurd a priviledge from the magistrates that none but he or by his licence should vent a spirit made almost after the same way with mine save that he leaves out one of the ingredients namely the quicklime but continues carneades to resume my former discourse where your curiosity interrupted it tis also a common practice in france to bury thin plates of copper in the marc as the french call it or husks of grapes whence the juice has been squeezd out in the winepress and by this means the more saline parts of those husks working by little and little upon the copper coagulate themselves with it into that blewish green substance we in english call verdigrease of which i therefore take notice because having distilld it in a naked fire i found as i expected that by the association of the saline with the metalline parts the former were so alterd that the distilld liquor even without rectification seemd by smell and tast strong almost like aqua fortis and very much surpassed the purest and most rectifid spirit of vinager that ever i made and this spirit i therefore ascribe to the salt of the husks alterd by their comixture with the copper though the fire afterwards divorce and transmute them because i found this later in the bottom of the retort in the forme of a crocus or redish powder and because copper is of too sluggish a nature to be forcd over in close vessels by no stronger a heat and that which is also somewhat remarkable in the destillation of good verdigrease or at least of that sort that i usd is this that i never could observe that it yielded me any oyl unless a little black slime which was separated in rectification may pass for oyle though both tartar and vinager especially the former will by destillation yield a moderate proportion of it if likewise you pour spirit of vinager upon calcind lead the acid salt of the liquor will by its commixture with the metalline parts though insipid acquire in a few hours a more than saccharine sweetness and these saline parts being by a strong fire destilld from the lead wherewith they were imbodyd will as i formerly also noted to a different purpose leave the metal behind them alterd in some qualities from what it was and will themselves ascend partly in the forme of an unctuous body or oyle partly in that of phlegme but for the greatest part in the forme of a subtile spirit indowd besides divers new qualities which i am not now willing to take notice of with a strong smell very much other than that of vinager and a piercing tast quite differing both from the sowerness of the spirit of vinager and the sweetness of the sugar of lead to be short as the difference of bodies may depend meerly upon that of the schemes whereinto their common matter is put so the seeds of things the fire and the other agents are able to alter the minute parts of a body either by breaking them into smaller ones of differing shapes or by uniting together these fragments with the unbroken corpuscles or such corpuscles among themselves and the same agents partly by altering the shape or bigness of the constituent corpuscles of a body partly by driving away some of them partly by blending others with them and partly by some new manner of connecting them may give the whole portion of matter a new texture of its minute parts and thereby make it deserve a new and distinct name so that according as the small parts of matter recede from each other or work upon each other or are connected together after this or that determinate manner a body of this or that denomination is produced as some other body happens thereby to be alterd or destroyd since then those things which chymists produce by the help of the fire are but inanimate bodies since such fruits of the chymists skill differ from one another but in so few qualities that we see plainly that by fire and other agents we can employ we can easily enough work as great alterations upon matter as those that are requisite to change one of these chymical productions into another since the same portion of matter may without being compounded with any extraneous body or at least element be made to put on such a variety of formes and consequently to be successively turnd into so many differing bodies and since the matter cloathd with so many differing formes was originally but water and that in its passage thorow so many transformations it was never reducd into any of those substances which are reputed to be the principles or elements of mixt bodies except by the violence of the fire which it self divides not bodies into perfectly simple or elementary substances but into new compounds since i say these things are so i see not why we must needs believe that there are any primogeneal and simple bodies of which as of preexsistent elements nature is obliged to compound all others nor do i see why we may not conceive that she may produce the bodies accounted mixt out of one another by variously altering and contriving their minute parts without resolving the matter into any such simple or homogeneous substances as are pretended neither to dispatch do i see why it should be counted absurd transcribers note absurd to think that when a body is resolvd by the fire into its supposd simple ingredients those substances are not true and proper elements but rather were as it were accidentally producd by the fire which by dissipating a body into minute parts does if those parts be shut up in close vessels for the most part necessarily bring them to associate themselves after another manner than before and so bring them into bodies of such different consistences as the former texture of the body and concurrent circumstances make such disbanded particles apt to constitute as experience shews us and i have both noted it and provd it already that as there are some concretes whose parts when dissipated by fire are fitted to be put into such schemes of matter as we call oyle and salt and spirit so there are others such as are especially the greatest part of minerals whose corpuscles being of another size or figure or perhaps contrivd another way will not in the fire yield bodies of the like consistences but rather others of differing textures not to mention that from gold and some other bodies we see not that the fire separates any distinct substances at all nor that even those similar parts of bodies which the chymists obtain by the fire are the elements whose names they bear but compound bodies upon which for their resemblance to them in consistence or some other obvious quality chymists have been pleasd to bestow such appellations the conclusion these last words of carneades being soon after followd by a noise which seemd to come from the place where the rest of the company was he took it for a warning that it was time for him to conclude or break off his discourse and told his friend by this time i hope you see eleutherius that if helmonts experiments be true it is no absurdity to question whether that doctrine be one that doth not assert any elements in the sence before explaind but because that as divers of my arguments suppose the marvellous power of the alkahest in the analyzing of bodies so the effects ascribd to that power are so unparallelld and stupendious that though i am not sure but that there may be such an agent yet little less than greek autopsia seems requisite to make a man sure there is and consequently i leave it to you to judge how farre those of my arguments that are built upon alkahestical operations are weakned by that liquors being matchless and shall therefore desire you not to think that i propose this paradox that rejects all elements as an opinion equally probable with the former part of my discourse for by that i hope you are satisfied that the arguments wont to be brought by chymists to prove that all bodies consist of either three principles or five are far from being so strong as those that i have employd to prove that there is not any certain and determinate number of such principles or elements to be met with universally in all mixt bodies and i suppose i need not tell you that these antichymical paradoxes might have been managd more to their advantage but that having not confind my curiosity to chymical experiments i who am but a young man and younger chymist can yet be but slenderly furnished with them in reference to so great and difficult a task as you imposd upon me besides that to tell you the truth i durst not employ some even of the best experiments i am acquainted with because i must not yet disclose them but however i think i may presume that what i have hitherto discoursed will induce you to think that chymists have been much more happy in finding experiments than the causes of them or in assigning the principles by which they may best be explaind and indeed when in the writings of paracelsus i meet with such phantastick and unintelligible discourses as that writer often puzzels and tyres his reader with fatherd upon such excellent experiments as though he seldom clearly teaches i often find he knew me thinks the chymists in their searches after truth are not unlike the navigators of solomons tarshish fleet who brought home from their long and tedious voyages not only gold and silver and ivory but apes and peacocks too for so the writings of several for i say not all of your hermetick philosophers present us together with divers substantial and noble experiments theories which either like peacocks feathers make a great shew but are neither solid nor useful or else like apes if they have some appearance of being rational are blemishd with some absurdity or other that when they are attentively considerd makes them appear ridiculous carneades having thus finishd his discourse against the received doctrines of the elements eleutherius judging he should not have time to say much to him before their separation made some haste to tell him i confess carneades that you have said more in favour of your paradoxes then i expected for though divers of the experiments you have mentiond are no secrets and were not unknown to me yet besides that you have added many of your own unto them you have laid them together in such a way and applyd them to such purposes and made such deductions from them as i have not hitherto met with but though i be therefore inclind to think that philoponus had he heard you would scarce have been able in all points to defend the chymical hypothesis against the arguments wherewith you have opposd it yet me thinks that however your objections seem to evince a great part of what they pretend to yet they evince it not all and the numerous tryals of those you call the vulgar chymists may be allowd to prove something too wherefore if it be granted you that you have made it probable first that the differing substances into which mixt bodies are wont to be resolved by the fire are not of a pure and an elementary nature especially for this reason that they yet retain so much of the nature of the concrete that afforded them as to appear to be yet somewhat compounded and oftentimes to differ in one concrete from principles of the same denomination in another next that as to the number of these differing substances neither is it precisely three because in most vegetable and animal bodies earth and phlegme are also to be found among their ingredients nor is there any one determinate number into which the fire as it is wont to be employd does precisely and universally resolve all compound bodies whatsoever as well minerals as others that are reputed perfectly mixt lastly that there are divers qualities which cannot well be referd to any of these substances as if they primarily resided in it and belongd to it and some other qualities which though they seem to have their chief and most ordinary residence in some one of these principles or elements of mixt bodies are not yet so deducible from it but that also some more general principles must be taken in to explicate them if i say the chymists continues eleutherius be so liberall as to make you these three concessions i hope you will on your part be so civil and equitable as to grant them these three other propositions namely first that divers mineral bodies and therefore probably all the rest may be resolvd into a saline a sulphureous and a mercurial part and that almost all vegetable and animal concretes may if not by the fire alone yet by a skilfull artist employing the fire as his chief instrument be divided into five differing substances salt spirit oyle phlegme and earth of which the three former by reason of their being so much more operative than the two later deserve to be lookt upon as the three active principles and by way of eminence to be calld the three principles of mixt bodies next that these principles though they be not perfectly devoid of all mixture yet may without inconvenience be stild the elements of compounded bodies and bear the names of those substances which they most resemble and which are manifestly predominant in them and that especially for this reason that none of these elements is divisible by the fire into four or five differing substances like the concrete whence it was separated lastly that divers of the qualities of a mixt body and especially the medical virtues do for the most part lodge in some one or other of its principles and may therefore usefully be sought for in that principle severd from the others and in this also pursues eleutherius methinks both you and the chymists may easily agree that the surest way is to learn by particular experiments what differing parts particular bodies do consist of and by what wayes either actual or potential fire they may best and most conveniently be separated as without relying too much upon the fire alone for the resolving of bodies so without fruitlessly contending to force them into more elements than nature made them up of or strip the severd principles so naked as by making them exquisitely elementary to make them almost useless these things subjoynes eleu i propose without despairing to see them granted by you not only because i know that you so much preferr the reputation of candor before that of subtility that your having once supposd a truth would not hinder you from imbracing it when clearly made out to you but because upon the present occasion it will be no disparagement to you to recede from some of your paradoxes since the nature and occasion of your past discourse did not oblige you to declare your own opinions but only to personate an antagonist of the chymists so that concludes he with a smile you may now by granting what i propose add the reputation of loving the truth sincerely to that of having been able to oppose it subtilly carneadess haste forbidding him to answer this crafty piece of flattery till i shal sayes he have an opportunity to acquaint you with my own opinions about the controversies i have been discoursing of you will not i hope expect i should declare my own sence of the arguments i have employd wherefore i shall only tell you thus much at present that though not only an acute naturalist but even i my self could take plausible exceptions at some of them yet divers of them too are such as will not perhaps be readily answerd and will reduce my adversaries at least to alter and reform their hypothesis i perceive i need not minde you that the objections i made against the quaternary of elements and ternary of principles needed not to be opposd so much against the doctrines themselves either of which especially the latter may be much more probably maintaind than hitherto it seems to have been by those writers for it i have met with as against the unaccurateness and the unconcludingness of the analytical experiments vulgarly relyed on to demonstrate them and therefore if either of the two examind opinions or any other theory of elements shall upon rational and experimental grounds be clearly made out to me tis obliging but not irrational in you to expect that i shall not be so farr in love with my disquieting doubts as not to be content to change them for undoubted truths and concludes carneades smiling it were no great disparagement for a sceptick to confesse to you that as unsatisfyd as the past discourse may have made you think me with the doctrines of the peripateticks and the chymists about the elements and principles i can yet so little discover what to acquiesce in that perchance the enquiries of others have scarce been more unsatisfactory to me than my own have been to my self finis the authors constant absence from the presse whilst the former treatise was printing and the nature of the subject it self wherewith ordinary composers are not wont to be at all acquainted will tis hopd procure the readers excuse till the next edition if the errata be somewhat numerous and if among them there want not some grosser mistakes which yet are not the only blemishes these lines must take notice of and acknowledg for the author now perceives that through the fault of those to whom he had committed the former treatise in loose sheets some papers that belonged to it have altogether miscarryed and though it have luckily enough happend for the most part that the omission of them does not marr the cohrence of the rest yet till the next designd edition afford an opportunity of inserting them it is thought fit that the printer give notice of one omission at the end of the first dialogue and that to these errata there be annexd the ensuing sheet of paper that was casually lost or forgotten by him that should have put it into the presse where it ought to have been inserted in the 187 printed page at the break betwixt the words nature in the 13th line and but in the next line after though it is to be noted here that by the mistake of the printer in some books the number of 187 is placed at the top of two somewhat distant pages and in such copies the following addition ought to be inserted in the latter of the two as followeth and on this occasion i cannot but take notice that whereas the great argument which the chymists are wont to employ to vilify earth and water and make them be lookd upon as useless and unworthy to be reckond among the principles of mixt bodies is that they are not endowd with specifick properties but only with elementary qualities of which they use to speak very sleightingly as of qualities contemptible and unactive i see no sufficient reason for this practice of the chymists for tis confessd that heat is an elementary quality and yet that an almost innumerable company of considerable things are performd by heat is manifest to them that duly consider the various phnomena wherein it intervenes as a principall actor and none ought less to ignore or distrust this truth then a chymist since almost all the operations and productions of his art are performed chiefly by the means of heat and as for cold it self upon whose account they so despise the earth and water if they please to read in the voyages of our english and dutch navigators in nova zembla and other northern regions what stupendious things may be effected by cold they would not perhaps think it so despicable and not to repeat what i lately recited to you out of paracelsus himself who by the help of an intense cold teaches to separate the quintessence of wine i will only now observe to you that the conservation of the texture of many bodies both animate and inanimate dos so much depend upon the convenient motion both of their own fluid and looser parts and of the ambient bodies whether air water c that not only in humane bodies we see that the immoderate or unseasonable coldness of the air especially when it finds such bodies overheated dos very frequently discompose the oeconomie of them and occasion variety of diseases but in the solid and durable body of iron it self in which one would not expect that suddain cold should produce any notable change it may have so great an operation that if you take a wire or other slender piece of steel and having brought it in the fire to a white heat you suffer it afterwards to cool leasurely in the air it will when it is cold be much of the same hardnesse it was of before whereas if as soon as you remove it from the fire you plunge it into cold water it will upon the sudden refrigeration acquire a very much greater hardness then it had before nay and will become manifestly brittle and that you may not impute this to any peculiar quality in the water or other liquor or unctuous matter wherein such heated steel is wont to be quenched that it may be temperd i know a very skillful tradesman that divers times hardens steel by suddenly cooling it in a body that is neither a liquor nor so much as moist a tryal of that nature i remember i have seen made and however by the operation that water has upon steel quenched in it whether upon the account of its coldness and moisture or upon that of any other of its qualities it appears that water is not alwaies so inefficacious and contemptible a body as our chymists would have it passe for and what i have said of the efficacy of cold and heat might perhaps be easily enough carried further by other considerations and experiments were it not that having been mentiond only upon the bye i must not insist on it but proceed to another subject errata pag 5 line 6
