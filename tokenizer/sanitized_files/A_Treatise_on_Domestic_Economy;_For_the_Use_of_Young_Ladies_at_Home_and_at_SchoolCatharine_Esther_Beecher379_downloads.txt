harper brothers 82 cliff street 1845 entered according to act of congress in the year 1842 by thomas h webb co in the clerks office of the district court of massachusetts to american mothers whose intelligence and virtues have inspired admiration and respect whose experience has furnished many valuable suggestions in this work whose approbation will be highly valued and whose influence in promoting the object aimed at is respectfully solicited this work is dedicated by their friend and countrywoman the author preface to the third edition the author of this work was led to attempt it by discovering in her extensive travels the deplorable sufferings of multitudes of young wives and mothers from the combined influence of poor health poor domestics and a defective domestic education the number of young women whose health is crushed ere the first few years of married life are past would seem incredible to one who has not investigated this subject and it would be vain to attempt to depict the sorrow discouragement and distress experienced in most families where the wife and mother is a perpetual invalid the writer became early convinced that this evil results mainly from the fact that young girls especially in the more wealthy classes are not trained for their profession in early life they go through a course of school training which results in great debility of constitution while at the same time their physical and domestic education is almost wholly neglected thus they enter on their most arduous and sacred duties so inexperienced and uninformed and with so little muscular and nervous strength that probably there is not one chance in ten that young women of the present day will pass through the first years of married life without such prostration of health and spirits as makes life a burden to themselves and it is to be feared such as seriously interrupts the confidence and happiness of married life the measure which more than any other would tend to remedy this evil would be to place domestic economy on an equality with the other sciences in female schools this should be done because it can be properly and systematically taught not practically but as a science as much so as political economy or moral science or any other branch of study because it embraces knowledge which will be needed by young women at all times and in all places because this science can never be properly taught until it is made a branch of study and because this method will secure a dignity and importance in the estimation of young girls which can never be accorded while they perceive their teachers and parents practically attaching more value to every other department of science than this when young ladies are taught the construction of their own bodies and all the causes in domestic life which tend to weaken the constitution when they are taught rightly to appreciate and learn the most convenient and economical modes of performing all family duties and of employing time and money and when they perceive the true estimate accorded to these things by teachers and friends the grand cause of this evil will be removed women will be trained to secure as of first importance a strong and healthy constitution and all those rules of thrift and economy that will make domestic duty easy and pleasant to promote this object the writer prepared this volume as a textbook for female schools it has been examined by the massachusetts board of education and been deemed worthy by them to be admitted as a part of the massachusetts school library it has also been adopted as a textbook in some of our largest and most popular female schools both at the east and west the following from the pen of mr george b emmerson one of the most popular and successful teachers in our country who has introduced this work as a textbook in his own school will exhibit the opinion of one who has formed his judgment from experience in the use of the work it may be objected that such things cannot be taught by books why not why may not the structure of the human body and the laws of health deduced therefrom be as well taught as the laws of natural philosophy why are not the application of these laws to the management of infants and young children as important to a woman as the application of the rules of arithmetic to the extraction of the cube root why may not the properties of the atmosphere be explained in reference to the proper ventilation of rooms or exercise in the open air as properly as to the burning of steel or sodium why is not the human skeleton as curious and interesting as the airpump and the action of the brain as the action of a steamengine why may not the healthiness of different kinds of food and drink the proper modes of cooking and the rules in reference to the modes and times of taking them be discussed as properly as rules of grammar or facts in history are not the principles that should regulate clothing the rules of cleanliness the advantages of early rising and domestic exercise as readily communicated as the principles of mineralogy or rules of syntax are not the rules of jesus christ applied to refine domestic manners and preserve a good temper as important as the abstract principles of ethics as taught by paley wayland or jouffroy may not the advantages of neatness system and order be as well illustrated in showing how they contribute to the happiness of a family as by showing how they add beauty to a copybook or a portfolio of drawings would not a teacher be as well employed in teaching the rules of economy in regard to time and expenses or in regard to dispensing charity as in teaching double or single entry in bookkeeping are not the principles that should guide in constructing a house and in warming and ventilating it properly as important to young girls as the principles of the athenian commonwealth or the rules of roman tactics is it not as important that children should be taught the dangers to the mental faculties when overexcited on the one hand or left unoccupied on the other as to teach them the conflicting theories of political economy or the speculations of metaphysicians for ourselves we have always found children especially girls peculiarly ready to listen to what they saw would prepare them for future duties the truth that education should be a preparation for actual real life has the greatest force with children the constantlyrecurring inquiry what will be the use of this study is always satisfied by showing that it will prepare for any duty relation or office which in the natural course of things will be likely to come we think this book extremely well suited to be used as a textbook in schools for young ladies and many chapters are well adapted for a reading book for children of both sexes to this the writer would add the testimony of a lady who has used this work with several classes of young girls and young ladies she remarked that she had never known a schoolbook that awakened more interest and that some young girls would learn a lesson in this when they would study nothing else she remarked also that when reciting the chapter on the construction of houses they became greatly interested in inventing plans of their own which gave an opportunity to the teacher to point out difficulties and defects had this part of domestic economy been taught in schools our land would not be so defaced with awkward misshapen inconvenient and at the same time needlessly expensive houses as it now is although the writer was trained to the care of children and to perform all branches of domestic duty by some of the best of housekeepers much in these pages is offered not as the result of her own experience but as what has obtained the approbation of some of the most judicious mothers and housekeepers in the nation the articles on physiology and hygiene and those on horticulture were derived from standard works on these subjects and are sanctioned by the highest authorities the american housekeepers receipt book is another work prepared by the author of the domestic economy in connexion with several experienced housekeepers and is designed for a supplement to this work on pages 354a and 354b will be found the preface and analysis of that work the two books being designed for a complete course of instructions on every department of domestic economy the copyright interest in these two works is held by a board of gentlemen appointed for the purpose who after paying a moderate compensation to the author for the time and labour spent in preparing these works will employ all the remainder paid over by the publishers to aid in educating and locating such female teachers as wish to be employed in those portions of our country which are most destitute of schools the contract with the publisher provides that the publisher shall guaranty the sales and thus secure against any losses for bad debts for which he shall receive five per cent he shall charge twenty per cent for commissions paid to retailers and also the expenses of printing paper and binding at the current market prices and make no other charges the net profits thus determined are then to be divided equally the publishers taking one half and paying the other half to the board above mentioned contents

reasons why american women should feel an interest in the support of the democratic institutions of their country which it is important that they should consider the great maxim which is the basis of all our civil and political institutions is that all men are created equal and that they are equally entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness but it can readily be seen that this is only another mode of expressing the fundamental principle which the great ruler of the universe has established as the law of his eternal government thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them are the scripture forms by which the supreme lawgiver requires that each individual of our race shall regard the happiness of others as of the same value as his own and which forbid any institution in private or civil life which secures advantages to one class by sacrificing the interests of another the principles of democracy then are identical with the principles of christianity but in order that each individual may pursue and secure the highest degree of happiness within his reach unimpeded by the selfish interests of others a system of laws must be established which sustain certain relations and dependencies in social and civil life what these relations and their attending obligations shall be are to be determined not with reference to the wishes and interests of a few but solely with reference to the general good of all so that each individual shall have his own interest as well as the public benefit secured by them for this purpose it is needful that certain relations be sustained which involve the duties of subordination there must be the magistrate and the subject one of whom is the superior and the other the inferior there must be the relations of husband and wife parent and child teacher and pupil employer and employed each involving the relative duties of subordination the superior in certain particulars is to direct and the inferior is to yield obedience society could never go forward harmoniously nor could any craft or profession be successfully pursued unless these superior and subordinate relations be instituted and sustained but who shall take the higher and who the subordinate stations in social and civil life this matter in the case of parents and children is decided by the creator he has given children to the control of parents as their superiors and to them they remain subordinate to a certain age or so long as they are members of their household and parents can delegate such a portion of their authority to teachers and employers as the interests of their children require in most other cases in a truly democratic state each individual is allowed to choose for himself who shall take the position of his superior no woman is forced to obey any husband but the one she chooses for herself nor is she obliged to take a husband if she prefers to remain single so every domestic and every artisan or laborer after passing from parental control can choose the employer to whom he is to accord obedience or if he prefers to relinquish certain advantages he can remain without taking a subordinate place to any employer each subject also has equal power with every other to decide who shall be his superior as a ruler the weakest the poorest the most illiterate has the same opportunity to determine this question as the richest the most learned and the most exalted and the various privileges that wealth secures are equally open to all classes every man may aim at riches unimpeded by any law or institution which secures peculiar privileges to a favored class at the expense of another every law and every institution is tested by examining whether it secures equal advantages to all and if the people become convinced that any regulation sacrifices the good of the majority to the interests of the smaller number they have power to abolish it the institutions of monarchical and aristocratic nations are based on precisely opposite principles they secure to certain small and favored classes advantages which can be maintained only by sacrificing the interests of the great mass of the people thus the throne and aristocracy of england are supported by laws and customs which burden the lower classes with taxes so enormous as to deprive them of all the luxuries and of most of the comforts of life poor dwellings scanty food unhealthy employments excessive labor and entire destitution of the means and time for education are appointed for the lower classes that a few may live in palaces and riot in every indulgence the tendencies of democratic institutions in reference to the rights and interests of the female sex have been fully developed in the united states and it is in this aspect that the subject is one of peculiar interest to american women in this country it is established both by opinion and by practice that woman has an equal interest in all social and civil concerns and that no domestic civil or political institution is right which sacrifices her interest to promote that of the other sex but in order to secure her the more firmly in all these privileges it is decided that in the domestic relation she take a subordinate station and that in civil and political concerns her interests be intrusted to the other sex without her taking any part in voting or in making and administering laws the result of this order of things has been fairly tested and is thus portrayed by m de tocqueville a writer who for intelligence fidelity and ability ranks second to none there are people in europe who confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike they would give to both the same functions impose on both the same duties and grant to both the same rights they would mix them in all thingstheir business their occupations their pleasures it may readily be conceived that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other both are degraded and from so preposterous a medley of the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women it is not thus that the americans understand the species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes they admit that as nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitutions of man and woman her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things but in getting each of them to fulfil their respective tasks in the best possible manner the americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactories of our age by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on in no country has such constant care been taken as in america to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other but in two pathways which are always different american women never manage the outward concerns of the family or conduct a business or take a part in political life nor are they on the other hand ever compelled to perform the rough labor of the fields or to make any of those laborious exertions which demand the exertion of physical strength no families are so poor as to form an exception to this rule if on the one hand an american woman cannot escape from the quiet circle of domestic employments on the other hand she is never forced to go beyond it hence it is that the women of america who often exhibit a masculine strength of understanding and a manly energy generally preserve great delicacy of personal appearance and always retain the manners of women although they sometimes show that they have the hearts and minds of men nor have the americans ever supposed that one consequence of democratic principles is the subversion of marital power or the confusion of the natural authorities in families they hold that every association must have a head in order to accomplish its object and that the natural head of the conjugal association is man they do not therefore deny him the right of directing his partner and they maintain that in the smaller association of husband and wife as well as in the great social community the object of democracy is to regulate and legalize the powers which are necessary not to subvert all power this opinion is not peculiar to one sex and contested by the other i never observed that the women of america considered conjugal authority as a fortunate usurpation of their rights nor that they thought themselves degraded by submitting to it it appears to me on the contrary that they attach a sort of pride to the voluntary surrender of their own will and make it their boast to bend themselves to the yoke not to shake it off such at least is the feeling expressed by the most virtuous of their sex the others are silent and in the united states it is not the practice for a guilty wife to clamor for the rights of woman while she is trampling on her holiest duties although the travellers who have visited north america differ on a great number of points they agree in remarking that morals are far more strict there than elsewherea it is evident that on this point the americans are very superior to their progenitors the english in england as in all other countries of europe public malice is constantly attacking the frailties of women philosophers and statesmen are heard to deplore that morals are not sufficiently strict and the literary productions of the country constantly lead one to suppose so in america all books novels not excepted suppose women to be chaste and no one thinks of relating affairs of gallantry it has often been remarked that in europe a certain degree of contempt lurks even in the flattery which men lavish upon women although a european frequently affects to be the slave of woman it may be seen that he never sincerely thinks her his equal in the united states men seldom compliment women but they daily show how much they esteem them they constantly display an entire confidence in the understanding of a wife and a profound respect for her freedom they have decided that her mind is just as fitted as that of a man to discover the plain truth and her heart as firm to embrace it and they have never sought to place her virtue any more than his under the shelter of prejudice ignorance and fear it would seem that in europe where man so easily submits to the despotic sway of woman they are nevertheless curtailed of some of the greatest qualities of the human species and considered as seductive but imperfect beings and what may well provoke astonishment women ultimately look upon themselves in the same light and almost consider it as a privilege that they are entitled to show themselves futile feeble and timid the women of america claim no such privileges it is true that the americans rarely lavish upon women those eager attentions which are commonly paid them in europe but their conduct to women always implies that they suppose them to be virtuous and refined and such is the respect entertained for the moral freedom of the sex that in the presence of a woman the most guarded language is used lest her ear should be offended by an expression in america a young unmarried woman may alone and without fear undertake a long journey thus the americans do not think that man and woman have either the duty or the right to perform the same offices but they show an equal regard for both their respective parts and though their lot is different they consider both of them as beings of equal value they do not give to the courage of woman the same form or the same direction as to that of man but they never doubt her courage and if they hold that man and his partner ought not always to exercise their intellect and understanding in the same manner they at least believe the understanding of the one to be as sound as that of the other and her intellect to be as clear thus then while they have allowed the social inferiority of woman to subsist they have done all they could to raise her morally and intellectually to the level of man and in this respect they appear to me to have excellently understood the true principle of democratic improvement as for myself i do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the united states are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence i have nowhere seen women occupying a loftier position and if i were asked now i am drawing to the close of this work in which i have spoken of so many important things done by the americans to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed i should replyto the superiority of their women this testimony of a foreigner who has had abundant opportunities of making a comparison is sanctioned by the assent of all candid and intelligent men who have enjoyed similar opportunities it appears then that it is in america alone that women are raised to an equality with the other sex and that both in theory and practice their interests are regarded as of equal value they are made subordinate in station only where a regard to their best interests demands it while as if in compensation for this by custom and courtesy they are always treated as superiors universally in this country through every class of society precedence is given to woman in all the comforts conveniences and courtesies of life in civil and political affairs american women take no interest or concern except so far as they sympathize with their family and personal friends but in all cases in which they do feel a concern their opinions and feelings have a consideration equal or even superior to that of the other sex in matters pertaining to the education of their children in the selection and support of a clergyman in all benevolent enterprises and in all questions relating to morals or manners they have a superior influence in such concerns it would be impossible to carry a point contrary to their judgement and feelings while an enterprise sustained by them will seldom fail of success if those who are bewailing themselves over the fancied wrongs and injuries of women in this nation could only see things as they are they would know that whatever remnants of a barbarous or aristocratic age may remain in our civil institutions in reference to the interests of women it is only because they are ignorant of them or do not use their influence to have them rectified for it is very certain that there is nothing reasonable which american women would unite in asking that would not readily be bestowed the preceding remarks then illustrate the position that the democratic institutions of this country are in reality no other than the principles of christianity carried into operation and that they tend to place woman in her true position in society as having equal rights with the other sex and that in fact they have secured to american women a lofty and fortunate position which as yet has been attained by the women of no other nation there is another topic presented in the work of the above author which demands the profound attention of american women the following is taken from that part of the introduction to the work illustrating the position that for ages there has been a constant progress in all civilized nations towards the democratic equality attained in this country the various occurrences of national existence have every where turned to the advantage of democracy all men have aided it by their exertions those who have intentionally labored in its cause and those who have served it unwittingly those who have fought for it and those who have declared themselves its opponents have all been driven along in the same track have all labored to one end all have been blind instruments in the hands of god the gradual developement of the equality of conditions is therefore a providential fact and it possesses all the characteristics of a divine decree it is universal it is durable it constantly eludes all human interference and all events as well as all men contribute to its progress the whole book which is here offered to the public has been written under the impression of a kind of religious dread produced in the authors mind by the contemplation of so irresistible a revolution which has advanced for centuries in spite of such amazing obstacles and which is still proceeding in the midst of the ruins it has made it is not necessary that god himself should speak in order to disclose to us the unquestionable signs of his will we can discern them in the habitual course of nature and in the invariable tendency of events if the men of our time were led by attentive observation and by sincere reflection to acknowledge that the gradual and progressive developement of social equality is at once the past and future of their history this solitary truth would confer the sacred character of a divine decree upon the change to attempt to check democracy would be in that case to resist the will of god and the nations would then be constrained to make the best of the social lot awarded to them by providence it is not then merely to satisfy a legitimate curiosity that i have examined america my wish has been to find instruction by which we may ourselves profit i have not even affected to discuss whether the social revolution which i believe to be irresistible is advantageous or prejudicial to mankind i have acknowledged this revolution as a fact already accomplished or on the eve of its accomplishment and i have selected the nation from among those which have undergone it in which its developement has been the most peaceful and the most complete in order to discern its natural consequences and if it be possible to distinguish the means by which it may be rendered profitable i confess that in america i saw more than america i sought the image of democracy itself with its inclinations its character its prejudices and its passions in order to learn what we have to fear or to hope from its progress it thus appears that the sublime and elevating anticipations which have filled the mind and heart of the religious world have become so far developed that philosophers and statesmen are perceiving the signs and are predicting the approach of the same grand consummation there is a day advancing by seers predicted and by poets sung when the curse of selfishness shall be removed when scenes surpassing fable and yet true shall be realized when all nations shall rejoice and be made blessed under those benevolent influences which the messiah came to establish on earth and this is the country which the disposer of events designs shall go forth as the cynosure of nations to guide them to the light and blessedness of that day to us is committed the grand the responsible privilege of exhibiting to the world the beneficent influences of christianity when carried into every social civil and political institution and though we have as yet made such imperfect advances already the light is streaming into the dark prisonhouse of despotic lands while startled kings and sages philosophers and statesmen are watching us with that interest which a career so illustrious and so involving their own destiny is calculated to excite they are studying our institutions scrutinizing our experience and watching for our mistakes that they may learn whether a social revolution so irresistible be advantageous or prejudicial to mankind there are persons who regard these interesting truths merely as food for national vanity but every reflecting and christian mind must consider it as an occasion for solemn and anxious reflection are we then a spectacle to the world has the eternal lawgiver appointed us to work out a problem involving the destiny of the whole earth are such momentous interests to be advanced or retarded just in proportion as we are faithful to our high trust what manner of persons then ought we to be in attempting to sustain so solemn so glorious a responsibility but the part to be enacted by american women in this great moral enterprise is the point to which special attention should here be directed the success of democratic institutions as is conceded by all depends upon the intellectual and moral character of the mass of the people if they are intelligent and virtuous democracy is a blessing but if they are ignorant and wicked it is only a curse and as much more dreadful than any other form of civil government as a thousand tyrants are more to be dreaded than one it is equally conceded that the formation of the moral and intellectual character of the young is committed mainly to the female hand the mother forms the character of the future man the sister bends the fibres that are hereafter to be the forest tree the wife sways the heart whose energies may turn for good or for evil the destinies of a nation let the women of a country be made virtuous and intelligent and the men will certainly be the same the proper education of a man decides the welfare of an individual but educate a woman and the interests of a whole family are secured if this be so as none will deny then to american women more than to any others on earth is committed the exalted privilege of extending over the world those blessed influences which are to renovate degraded man and clothe all climes with beauty no american woman then has any occasion for feeling that hers is an humble or insignificant lot the value of what an individual accomplishes is to be estimated by the importance of the enterprise achieved and not by the particular position of the laborer the drops of heaven which freshen the earth are each of equal value whether they fall in the lowland meadow or the princely parterre the builders of a temple are of equal importance whether they labor on the foundations or toil upon the dome thus also with those labors which are to be made effectual in the regeneration of the earth and it is by forming a habit of regarding the apparently insignificant efforts of each isolated laborer in a comprehensive manner as indispensable portions of a grand result that the minds of all however humble their sphere of service can be invigorated and cheered the woman who is rearing a family of children the woman who labors in the schoolroom the woman who in her retired chamber earns with her needle the mite which contributes to the intellectual and moral elevation of her country even the humble domestic whose example and influence may be moulding and forming young minds while her faithful services sustain a prosperous domestic stateeach and all may be animated by the consciousness that they are agents in accomplishing the greatest work that ever was committed to human responsibility it is the building of a glorious temple whose base shall be coextensive with the bounds of the earth whose summit shall pierce the skies whose splendor shall beam on all lands and those who hew the lowliest stone as much as those who carve the highest capital will be equally honored when its topstone shall be laid with new rejoicings of the morning stars and shoutings of the sons of god footnote a miss martineau is a singular exception to this remark after receiving unexampled hospitalities and kindnesses she gives the following picture of her entertainers having in other places spoken of the american woman as having her intellect confined and her morals crushed and as deficient in education because she has none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite she saysit is assumed in america particularly in new england that the morals of society there are peculiarly pure i am grieved to doubt the fact but i do doubt it the auldrobingray story is a frequentlyenacted tragedy here and one of the worst symptoms that struck me was that there was usually a demand upon my sympathy in such casesthe unavoidable consequence of such a mode of marrying is that the sanctity of marriage is impaired and that vice succeeds there are sad tales in country villages here and there that attest this and yet more in towns in a rank of society where such things are seldom or never heard of in englandi unavoidably knew of more cases of lapse in highly respectable families in one state than ever came to my knowledge at home and they were got over with a disgrace far more temporary and superficial than they could have been visited with in englandthe vacuity of mind of many women is i conclude the cause of a vice which it is painful to allude to but which cannot honestly be passed overit is no secret on the spot that the habit of intemperance is not infrequent among women of station and education in the most enlightened parts of the country i witnessed some instances and heard of more it does not seem to me to be regarded with all the dismay which such a symptom ought to excite to the stranger a novelty so horrible a spectacle so fearful suggests wide and deep subjects of investigation it is not possible for language to give representations more false in every item in evidence of this the writer would mention that within the last few years she has travelled almost the entire route taken by miss martineau except the lower tier of the southern states and though not meeting the same individuals has mingled in the very same circles moreover she has resided from several months to several years in eight of the different northern and western states and spent several weeks at a time in five other states she has also had pupils from every state in the union but two and has visited extensively at their houses but in her whole life and in all these different positions the writer has never to her knowledge seen even one woman of the classes with which she has associated who had lapsed in the manner indicated by miss martineau nor does she believe that such a woman could find admission in such circles any where in the country as to intemperate women five cases are all of whom the writer has ever heard in such circles and two of these many believed to be unwarrantably suspected after following in miss martineaus track and discovering all the falsehood twaddle gossip old saws and almanac stories which have been strung together in her books no charitable mode of accounting for the medley remains but to suppose her the pitiable dupe of that love of hoaxing so often found in our country again miss martineau says we passed an unshaded meadow where the grass had caught fire every day at eleven oclock the preceding summer this demonstrates the necessity of shade a woman with so little common sense as to swallow such an absurdity for truth and then tack to it such an astute deduction must be a tempting subject for the abovementioned mischievous propensity chapter ii difficulties peculiar to american women in the preceding chapter were presented those views which are calculated to inspire american women with a sense of their high responsibilities to their country and to the world and of the excellence and grandeur of the object to which their energies may be consecrated but it will be found to be the law of moral action that whatever involves great results and great benefits is always attended with great hazards and difficulties and as it has been shown that american women have a loftier position and a more elevated object of enterprise than the females of any other nation so it will appear that they have greater trials and difficulties to overcome than any other women are called to encounter properly to appreciate the nature of these trials it must be borne in mind that the estimate of evils and privations depends not so much on their positive nature as on the character and habits of the person who meets them a woman educated in the savage state finds it no trial to be destitute of many conveniences which a woman even of the lowest condition in this country would deem indispensable to existence so a woman educated with the tastes and habits of the best new england or virginia housekeepers would encounter many deprivations and trials which would never occur to one reared in the log cabin of a new settlement so also a woman who has been accustomed to carry forward her arrangements with welltrained domestics would meet a thousand trials to her feelings and temper by the substitution of ignorant foreigners or shiftless slaves which would be of little account to one who had never enjoyed any better service now the larger portion of american women are the descendants of english progenitors who as a nation are distinguished for systematic housekeeping and for a great love of order cleanliness and comfort and american women to a greater or less extent have inherited similar tastes and habits but the prosperity and democratic tendencies of this country produce results materially affecting the comfort of housekeepers which the females of monarchical and aristocratic lands are not called to meet in such countries all ranks and classes are fixed in a given position and each person is educated for a particular sphere and style of living and the dwellings conveniences and customs of life remain very nearly the same from generation to generation this secures the preparation of all classes for their particular station and makes the lower orders more dependent and more subservient to employers but how different is the state of things in this country every thing is moving and changing persons in poverty are rising to opulence and persons of wealth are sinking to poverty the children of common laborers by their talents and enterprise are becoming nobles in intellect or wealth or office while the children of the wealthy enervated by indulgence are sinking to humbler stations the sons of the wealthy are leaving the rich mansions of their fathers to dwell in the log cabins of the forest where very soon they bear away the daughters of ease and refinement to share the privations of a new settlement meantime even in the more stationary portions of the community there is a mingling of all grades of wealth intellect and education there are no distinct classes as in aristocratic lands whose bounds are protected by distinct and impassable lines but all are thrown into promiscuous masses thus persons of humble means are brought into contact with those of vast wealth while all intervening grades are placed side by side thus too there is a constant comparison of conditions among equals and a constant temptation presented to imitate the customs and to strive for the enjoyments of those who possess larger means in addition to this the flow of wealth among all classes is constantly increasing the number of those who live in a style demanding much hired service while the number of those who are compelled to go to service is constantly diminishing our manufactories also are making increased demands for female labor and offering larger compensation in consequence of these things there is such a disproportion between those who wish to hire and those who are willing to go to domestic service that in the nonslaveholding states were it not for the supply of povertystricken foreigners there would not be a domestic for each family who demands one and this resort to foreigners poor as it is scarcely meets the demand while the disproportion must every year increase especially if our prosperity increases for just in proportion as wealth rolls in upon us the number of those who will give up their own independent homes to serve strangers will be diminished the difficulties and sufferings which have accrued to american women from this cause are almost incalculable there is nothing which so much demands system and regularity as the affairs of a housekeeper made up as they are of ten thousand desultory and minute items and yet this perpetually fluctuating state of society seems forever to bar any such system and regularity the anxieties vexations perplexities and even hard labor which come upon american women from this state of domestic service are endless and many a woman has in consequence been disheartened discouraged and ruined in health the only wonder is that amid so many real difficulties american women are still able to maintain such a character for energy fortitude and amiableness as is universally allowed to be their due but the second and still greater difficulty peculiar to american women is a delicacy of constitution which renders them early victims to disease and decay the fact that the women of this country are unusually subject to disease and that their beauty and youthfulness are of shorter continuance than those of the women of other nations is one which always attracts the attention of foreigners while medical men and philanthropists are constantly giving fearful monitions as to the extent and alarming increase of this evil investigations make it evident that a large proportion of young ladies from the wealthier classes have the incipient stages of curvature of the spine one of the most sure and fruitful causes of future disease and decay the writer has heard medical men who have made extensive inquiries say that a very large proportion of the young women at boarding schools are affected in this way while many other indications of disease and debility exist in cases where this particular evil cannot be detected in consequence of this enfeebled state of their constitutions induced by a neglect of their physical education as soon as they are called to the responsibilities and trials of domestic life their constitution fails and their whole existence is rendered a burden for no woman can enjoy existence when disease throws a dark cloud over the mind and incapacitates her for the proper discharge of every duty the writer who for some ten years has had the charge of an institution consisting of young ladies from almost every state in the union since relinquishing that charge has travelled and visited extensively in most of the nonslaveholding states in these circuits she has learned the domestic history not merely of her pupils but of many other young wives and mothers whose sorrowful experience has come to her knowledge and the impression produced by the dreadful extent of this evil has at times been almost overwhelming it would seem as if the primeval curse which has written the doom of pain and sorrow on one period of a young mothers life in this country had been extended over all so that the hour seldom arrives when she forgetteth her sorrow for joy that a man is born into the world many a mother will testify with shuddering that the most exquisite sufferings she ever endured were not those appointed by nature but those which for week after week have worn down health and spirits when nourishing her child and medical men teach us that this in most cases results from a debility of constitution consequent on the mismanagement of early life and so frequent and so mournful are these and the other distresses that result from the delicacy of the female constitution that the writer has repeatedly heard mothers say that they had wept tears of bitterness over their infant daughters at the thought of the sufferings which they were destined to undergo while they cherished the decided wish that these daughters should never marry at the same time many a reflecting young woman is looking to her future prospects with very different feelings and hopes from those which providence designed a perfectly healthy woman especially a perfectly healthy mother is so unfrequent in some of the wealthier classes that those who are so may be regarded as the exceptions and not as the general rule the writer has heard some of her friends declare that they would ride fifty miles to see a perfectly healthy and vigorous woman out of the laboring classes this although somewhat jocose was not an entirely unfair picture of the true state of female health in the wealthier classes there are many causes operating which serve to perpetuate and increase this evil it is a wellknown fact that mental excitement tends to weaken the physical system unless it is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase of exercise and fresh air now the people of this country are under the influence of high commercial political and religious stimulus altogether greater than was ever known by any other nation and in all this women are made the sympathizing companions of the other sex at the same time young girls in pursuing an education have ten times greater an amount of intellectual taxation demanded than was ever before exacted let any daughter educated in our best schools at this day compare the course of her study with that pursued in her mothers early life and it will be seen that this estimate of the increase of mental taxation probably falls below the truth though in some countries there are small classes of females in the higher circles who pursue literature and science to a far greater extent than in any corresponding circles in this country yet in no nation in the world are the advantages of a good intellectual education enjoyed by so large a proportion of the females and this education has consisted far less of accomplishments and far more of those solid studies which demand the exercise of the various powers of mind than the education of the women of other lands and when american women are called to the responsibilities of domestic life the degree in which their minds and feelings are taxed is altogether greater than it is in any other nation no women on earth have a higher sense of their moral and religious responsibilities or better understand not only what is demanded of them as housekeepers but all the claims that rest upon them as wives mothers and members of a social community an american woman who is the mistress of a family feels her obligations in reference to her influence over her husband and a still greater responsibility in rearing and educating her children she feels too the claims which the moral interests of her domestics have on her watchful care in social life she recognises the claims of hospitality and the demands of friendly visiting her responsibility in reference to the institutions of benevolence and religion is deeply realized the regular worship of the lords day and all the various religious meetings and benevolent societies which place so much dependence on female influence and example she feels obligated to sustain add to these multiplied responsibilities the perplexities and evils which have been pointed out resulting from the fluctuating state of society and the deficiency of domestic service and no one can deny that american women are exposed to a far greater amount of intellectual and moral excitement than those of any other land of course in order to escape the danger resulting from this a greater amount of exercise in the fresh air and all those methods which strengthen the constitution are imperiously required but instead of this it will be found that owing to the climate and customs of this nation there are no women who secure so little of this healthful and protecting regimen as ours walking and riding and gardening in the open air are practised by the women of other lands to a far greater extent than by american females most english women in the wealthier classes are able to walk six and eight miles without oppressive fatigue and when they visit this country always express their surprise at the inactive habits of american ladies in england regular exercise in the open air is very commonly required by the mother as a part of daily duty and is sought by young women as an enjoyment in consequence of a different physical training english women in those circles which enjoy competency present an appearance which always strikes american gentlemen as a contrast to what they see at home an english mother at thirty or thirtyfive is in the full bloom of perfected womanhood as fresh and healthful as her daughters but where are the american mothers who can reach this period unfaded and unworn in america young ladies of the wealthier classes are sent to school from early childhood and neither parents nor teachers make it a definite object to secure a proper amount of fresh air and exercise to counterbalance this intellectual taxation as soon as their school days are over dressing visiting evening parties and stimulating amusements take the place of study while the most unhealthful modes of dress add to the physical exposures to make morning calls or do a little shopping is all that can be termed their exercise in the fresh air and this compared to what is needed is absolutely nothing and on some accounts is worse than nothingb in consequence of these and other evils which will be pointed out more at large in the following pages the young women of america grow up with such a delicacy of constitution that probably eight out of ten become subjects of disease either before or as soon as they are called to the responsibilities of domestic life but there is one peculiarity of situation in regard to american women which makes this delicacy of constitution still more disastrous it is the liability to the exposures and hardships of a newlysettled country one more extract from de tocqueville will give a view of this part of the subject which any one familiar with western life will admire for its verisimilitude the same strength of purpose which the young wives of america display in bending themselves at once and without repining to the austere duties of their new condition is no less manifest in all the great trials of their lives in no country in the world are private fortunes more precarious than in the united states it is not uncommon for the same man in the course of his life to rise and sink again through all the grades which lead from opulence to poverty american women support these vicissitudes with a calm and unquenchable energy it would seem that their desires contract as easily as they expand with their fortunes the greater part of the adventurers who migrate every year to people the western wilds belong to the old angloamerican race of the northern states many of these men who rush so boldly onward in pursuit of wealth were already in the enjoyment of a competency in their own part of the country they take their wives along with them and make them share the countless perils and privations which always attend the commencement of these expeditions i have often met even on the verge of the wilderness with young women who after having been brought up amid all the comforts of the large towns of new england had passed almost without any intermediate stage from the wealthy abode of their parents to a comfortless hovel in a forest fever solitude and a tedious life had not broken the springs of their courage their features were impaired and faded but their looks were firm they appeared to be at once sad and resolute in another passage he gives this picturesque sketch by the side of the hearth sits a woman with a baby on her lap she nods to us without disturbing herself like the pioneer this woman is in the prime of life her appearance would seem superior to her condition and her apparel even betrays a lingering taste for dress but her delicate limbs appear shrunken her features are drawn in her eye is mild and melancholy her whole physiognomy bears marks of a degree of religious resignation a deep quiet of all passion and some sort of natural and tranquil firmness ready to meet all the ills of life without fearing and without braving them her children cluster about her full of health turbulence and energy they are true children of the wilderness their mother watches them from time to time with mingled melancholy and joy to look at their strength and her languor one might imagine that the life she had given them had exhausted her own and still she regrets not what they have cost her the house inhabited by these emigrants has no internal partition or loft in the one chamber of which it consists the whole family is gathered for the night the dwelling is itself a little world an ark of civilization amid an ocean of foliage a hundred steps beyond it the primeval forest spreads its shades and solitude resumes its sway such scenes and such women the writer has met and few persons realize how many refined and lovely women are scattered over the broad prairies and deep forests of the west and none but the father above appreciates the extent of those sacrifices and sufferings and the value of that firm faith and religious hope which live in perennial bloom amid those vast solitudes if the american women of the east merit the palm for their skill and success as accomplished housekeepers still more is due to the heroines of the west who with such unyielding fortitude and cheerful endurance attempt similar duties amid so many disadvantages and deprivations but though american women have those elevated principles and feelings which enable them to meet such trials in so exemplary a manner their physical energies are not equal to the exertions demanded though the mind may be bright and firm the casket is shivered though the spirit may be willing the flesh is weak a woman of firm health with the hope and elasticity of youth may be envied rather than pitied as she shares with her young husband the hopes and enterprises of pioneer life but when the body fails then the eye of hope grows dim the heart sickens the courage dies and in solitude weariness and suffering the wanderer pines for the dear voices and the tender sympathies of a far distant home then it is that the darkest shade is presented which marks the peculiar trials and liabilities of american women and which exhibits still more forcibly the disastrous results of that delicacy of constitution which has been pointed out for though all american women or even the greater part of them are not called to encounter such trials yet no mother who rears a family of daughters can say that such a lot will not fall to one of her flock nor can she know which will escape the reverses of fortune and the chances of matrimony expose every woman in the nation to such liabilities for which she needs to be prepared footnote b so little idea have most ladies in the wealthier classes of what is a proper amount of exercise that if they should succeed in walking a mile or so at a moderate pace three or four times a week they would call it taking a great deal of exercise chapter iii remedies for the preceding difficulties having pointed out the peculiar responsibilities of american women and the peculiar embarrassments which they are called to encounter the following suggestions are offered as remedies for such difficulties in the first place the physical and domestic education of daughters should occupy the principal attention of mothers in childhood and the stimulation of the intellect should be very much reduced as a general rule daughters should not be sent to school before they are six years old and when they are sent far more attention should be paid to their physical developement than is usually done they should never be confined at any employment more than an hour at a time and this confinement should be followed by sports in the open air such accommodations should be secured that at all seasons and in all weathers the teacher can every half hour send out a portion of her school for sports and still more care should be given to preserve pure air in the schoolroom the close stoves crowded condition and poisonous air of most schoolrooms act as constant drains on the health and strength of young children in addition to this much less time should be given to school and much more to domestic employments especially in the wealthier classes a little girl may begin at five or six years of age to assist her mother and if properly trained by the time she is ten she can render essential aid from this time until she is fourteen or fifteen it should be the principal object of her education to secure a strong and healthy constitution and a thorough practical knowledge of all kinds of domestic employments during this period though some attention ought to be paid to intellectual culture it ought to be made altogether secondary in importance and such a measure of study and intellectual excitement as is now demanded in our best female seminaries ought never to be allowed until a young lady has passed the most critical period of her youth and has a vigorous and healthful constitution fully established the plan might be adopted of having schools for young girls kept only in the afternoon that their mornings might be occupied in domestic exercise without interfering with school employments where a proper supply of domestic exercise cannot be afforded the cultivation of flowers and fruits might be resorted to as a delightful and unfailing promotive of pleasure and health and it is to that class of mothers who have the best means of securing hired service and who are the most tempted to allow their daughters to grow up with inactive habits that their country and the world must look for a reformation in this respect whatever ladies in the wealthier classes decide shall be fashionable will be followed by all the rest but while they persist in the aristocratic habits now so common and bring up their daughters to feel as if labor was degrading and unbecoming the evils pointed out will never find a remedy it is therefore the peculiar duty of ladies who have wealth to set a proper example in this particular and make it their first aim to secure a strong and healthful constitution for their daughters by active domestic employments all the sweeping dusting care of furniture and beds the clear starching and the nice cooking should be done by the daughters of a family and not by hired servants it may cost the mother more care and she may find it needful to hire a person for the express purpose of instructing and superintending her daughters in these employments but it should be regarded as indispensable to be secured either by the mothers agency or by a substitute it is in this point of view that the dearth of good domestics in this country may in its results prove a substantial blessing if all housekeepers who have the means could secure good servants there would be little hope that so important a revolution in the domestic customs of the wealthy classes could be effected and so great is the natural indolence of mankind that the amount of exercise needful for health will never be secured by those who are led to it through no necessity but merely from rational considerations yet the pressure of domestic troubles from the want of good domestics has already determined many a mother in the wealthy classes to train her daughters to aid her in domestic service and thus necessity is compelling mothers to do what abstract principles of expediency could never secure a second method of promoting the same object is to raise the science and practice of domestic economy to its appropriate place as a regular study in female seminaries the succeeding chapter will present the reasons for this more at large but it is to the mothers of our country that the community must look for this change it cannot be expected that teachers who have their attention chiefly absorbed by the intellectual and moral interests of their pupils should properly realize the importance of this department of education but if mothers generally become convinced of this their judgement and wishes will meet the respectful consideration they deserve and the object will be accomplished the third method of securing a remedy for the evils pointed out is the endowment of female institutions under the care of suitable trustees who shall secure a proper course of education the importance of this measure cannot be realized by those who have not turned their attention to this subject and for such the following considerations are presented the endowment of colleges and of law medical and divinity schools for the other sex is designed to secure a thorough and proper education for those who have the most important duties of society to perform the men who are to expound the laws the men who have the care of the public health and the men who are to communicate religious instruction should have welldisciplined and wellinformed minds and it is mainly for this object that collegiate and professional institutions are established liberal and wealthy individuals contribute funds and the legislatures of the states also lend assistance so that every state in this nation has from one to twenty such endowed institutions supplied with buildings apparatus a library and a faculty of learned men to carry forward a superior course of instruction and the use of all these advantages is secured in many cases at an expense no greater than is required to send a boy to a common school and pay his board there no private school could offer these advantages without charging such a sum as would forbid all but the rich from securing its benefits by furnishing such superior advantages on low terms multitudes are properly educated who would otherwise remain in ignorance and thus the professions are supplied by men properly qualified for them were there no such institutions and no regular and appropriate course of study demanded for admission to the bar the pulpit and to medical practice the education of most professional men would be desultory imperfect and deficient parents and children would regulate the course of study according to their own crude notions and instead of having institutions which agree in carrying on a similar course of study each school would have its own peculiar system and compete and conflict with every other meantime the public would have no means of deciding which was best nor any opportunity for learning when a professional man was properly qualified for his duties but as it is the diploma of a college and the license of an appointed body of judges must both be secured before a young man feels that he has entered the most promising path to success in his profession our country then is most abundantly supplied with endowed institutions which secure a liberal education on such low terms as make them accessible to all classes and in which the interests of education are watched over sustained and made permanent by an appropriate board of trustees but are not the most responsible of all duties committed to the charge of woman is it not her profession to take care of mind body and soul and that too at the most critical of all periods of existence and is it not as much a matter of public concern that she should be properly qualified for her duties as that ministers lawyers and physicians should be prepared for theirs and is it not as important to endow institutions which shall make a superior education accessible to all classesfor females as for the other sex and is it not equally important that institutions for females be under the supervision of intelligent and responsible trustees whose duty it shall be to secure a uniform and appropriate education for one sex as much as for the other it would seem as if every mind must accord an affirmative reply as soon as the matter is fairly considered as the education of females is now conducted any man or woman who pleases can establish a female seminary and secure recommendations which will attract pupils but whose business is it to see that these young females are not huddled into crowded rooms or that they do not sleep in illventilated chambers or that they have healthful food or that they have the requisite amount of fresh air and exercise or that they pursue an appropriate and systematic course of study or that their manners principles and morals are properly regulated parents either have not the means or else are not qualified to judge or if they are furnished with means and capacity they are often restricted to a choice of the best school within reach even when it is known to be exceedingly objectionable if the writer were to disclose all that can truly be told of boardingschool life and its influence on health manners disposition intellect and morals the disclosure would both astonish and shock every rational mind and yet she believes that such institutions are far better managed in this country than in any other and that the number of those which are subject to imputations in these respects is much less than could reasonably be expected but it is most surely the case that much remains to be done in order to supply such institutions as are needed for the proper education of american women in attempting a sketch of the kind of institutions which are demanded it is very fortunate that there is no necessity for presenting a theory which may or may not be approved by experience it is the greatest honor of one of our newest western states that it can boast of such an institution endowed too wholly by the munificence of a single individual a slight sketch of this institution which the writer has examined in all its details will give an idea of what can be done by showing what has actually been accomplished this institutionc is under the supervision of a board of trustees who hold the property in trust for the object to which it is devoted and who have the power to fill their own vacancies it is furnished with a noble and tasteful building of stone so liberal in dimensions and arrangement that it can accommodate ninety pupils and teachers giving one room to every two pupils and all being so arranged as to admit of thorough ventilation this building is surrounded by extensive grounds enclosed with handsome fences where remains of the primeval forest still offer refreshing shade for juvenile sports to secure adequate exercise for the pupils two methods are adopted by the first each young lady is required to spend a certain portion of time in domestic employments either in sweeping dusting setting and clearing tables washing and ironing or other household concerns let not the aristocratic mother and daughter express their dislike of such an arrangement till they can learn how well it succeeds let them walk as the writer has done through the large airy halls kept clean and in order by their fair occupants to the washing and ironingrooms there they will see a long hall conveniently fitted up with some thirty neatlypainted tubs with a clean floor and water conducted so as to save both labor and slopping let them see some thirty or forty merry girls superintended by a motherly lady chatting and singing washing and starching while every convenience is at hand and every thing around is clean and comfortable two hours thus employed enable each young lady to wash the articles she used during the previous week which is all that is demanded while thus they are all practically initiated into the arts and mysteries of the washtub the superintendent remarked to the writer that after a few weeks of probation most of her young washers succeeded quite as well as those whom she could hire and who made it their business adjacent to the washingroom is the ironing establishment where another class are arranged on the ironingday around long extended tables with heatingfurnaces clothesframes and all needful appliances by a systematic arrangement of school and domestic duties a moderate portion of time usually not exceeding two hours a day from each of the pupils accomplished all the domestic labor of a family of ninety except the cooking which was done by two hired domestics this part of domestic labor it was deemed inexpedient to incorporate as a portion of the business of the pupils inasmuch as it could not be accommodated to the arrangements of the school and was in other respects objectionable is it asked how can young ladies paint play the piano and study when their hands and dresses must be unfitted by such drudgery the woman who asks this question has yet to learn that a pure and delicate skin is better secured by healthful exercise than by any other method and that a young lady who will spend two hours a day at the washtub or with a broom is far more likely to have rosy cheeks a finelymoulded form and a delicate skin than one who lolls all day in her parlor or chamber or only leaves it girt in tight dresses to make fashionable calls it is true that longprotracted daily labor hardens the hand and unfits it for delicate employments but the amount of labor needful for health produces no such effect as to dress and appearance if neat and convenient accommodations are furnished there is no occasion for the exposures which demand shabby dresses a dark calico genteelly made with an oiledsilk apron and wide cuffs of the same material secures both good looks and good service this plan of domestic employments for the pupils in this institution not only secures regular healthful exercise but also aids to reduce the expenses of education so that with the help of the endowments it is brought within the reach of many who otherwise could never gain such advantages in addition to this a system of calisthenicd exercises is introduced which secures all the advantages which dancing is supposed to effect and which is free from the dangerous tendencies of that fascinating and fashionable amusement this system is so combined with music and constantly varying evolutions as to serve as an amusement and also as a mode of curing distortions particularly all tendencies to curvature of the spine while at the same time it tends to promote grace of movement and easy manners another advantage of this institution is an elevated and invigorating course of mental discipline many persons seem to suppose that the chief object of an intellectual education is the acquisition of knowledge but it will be found that this is only a secondary object the formation of habits of investigation of correct reasoning of persevering attention of regular system of accurate analysis and of vigorous mental action is the primary object to be sought in preparing american women for their arduous duties duties which will demand not only quickness of perception but steadiness of purpose regularity of system and perseverance in action it is for such purposes that the discipline of the mathematics is so important an element in female education and it is in this aspect that the mere acquisition of facts and the attainment of accomplishments should be made of altogether secondary account in the institution here described a systematic course of study is adopted as in our colleges designed to occupy three years the following slight outline of the course will exhibit the liberal plan adopted in this respect in mathematics the whole of arithmetic contained in the larger works used in schools the whole of euclid and such portions from days mathematics as are requisite to enable the pupils to demonstrate the various problems in olmsteds larger work on natural philosophy in language besides english grammar a short course in latin is required sufficient to secure an understanding of the philosophy of the language and that kind of mental discipline which the exercise of translating affords in philosophy chemistry astronomy botany geology and mineralogy intellectual and moral philosophy political economy and the evidences of christianity the same textbooks are used as are required at our best colleges in geography the most thorough course is adopted and in history a more complete knowledge is secured by means of charts and textbooks than most of our colleges offer to these branches are added griscoms physiologye bigelows technology and jahns archology together with a course of instruction in polite literature for which chamberss english literature is employed as the textbook each recitation being attended with selections and criticisms from teacher or pupils on the various authors brought into notice vocal music on the plan of the boston academy is a part of the daily instructions linear drawing and pencilling are designed also to be a part of the course instrumental music is taught but not as a part of the regular course of study to secure the proper instruction in all these branches the division of labor adopted in colleges is pursued each teacher has distinct branches as her department for which she is responsible and in which she is independent one teacher performs the duties of a governess in maintaining rules and attending to the habits and manners of the pupils by this method the teachers have sufficient time both to prepare themselves and to impart instruction and illustration in the classroom in this institution it is made a direct object of effort to cure defects of character and habits at the frequent meetings of the principal and teachers the peculiarities of each pupil are made the subjects of inquiry and methods are devised for remedying defects through the personal influence of the several teachers this when thus made a direct object of combined effort often secures results most gratifying and encouraging one peculiarity of this institution demands consideration by the method adopted here the exclusive business of educating their own sex is as it ever ought to be confined to females the principal of the institution indeed is a gentleman but while he takes the position of a father of the family and responsible head of the whole concern the entire charge of instruction and most of the responsibilities in regard to health morals and manners rest upon the female teachers in their several departments the principal is the chaplain and religious teacher and is a member of the board of instructors so far as to have a right to advise and an equal vote in every question pertaining to the concerns of the school and thus he acts as a sort of regulator and mainspring in all the various departments but no one person in the institution is loaded with the excessive responsibilities which rest upon one where a large institution of this kind has a principal who employs and directs all the subordinate assistants the writer has never before seen the principle of the division of labor and responsibility so perfectly carried out in any female institution and she believes that experience will prove that this is the true model for combining in appropriate proportions the agency of both sexes in carrying forward such an institution there are cases where females are well qualified and feel willing to take the place occupied by the principal but such cases are rare one thing more should be noticed to the credit of the rising state where this institution is located a female association has been formed embracing a large portion of the ladies of standing and wealth the design of which is to educate gratuitously at this and other similar institutions such females as are anxious to obtain a good education and are destitute of the means if this enterprise is continued with the same energy and perseverance as has been manifested during the last few years that state will take the lead of her sister states in welleducated women and if the views in the preceding pages are correct this will give her precedence in every intellectual and moral advantage many who are not aware of the great economy secured by a proper division of labor will not understand how so extensive a course can be properly completed in three years but in this institution none are received under fourteen and a certain amount of previous acquisition is required in order to admission as is done in our colleges this secures a diminution of classes so that but few studies are pursued at one time while the number of wellqualified teachers is so adequate that full time is afforded for all needful instruction and illustration where teachers have so many classes that they merely have time to find out what the pupils learn from books without any aid from their teachers the acquisitions of the pupils are vague and imperfect and soon pass away so that an immense amount of expense time and labor is spent in acquiring or recalling what is lost about as fast as it is gained parents are little aware of the immense waste incurred by the present mode of conducting female education in the wealthy classes young girls are sent to school as a matter of course year after year confined for six hours a day to the schoolhouse and required to add some time out of school to learning their lessons thus during the most critical period of life they are for a long time immured in a room filled with an atmosphere vitiated by many breaths and are constantly kept under some sort of responsibility in regard to mental effort their studies are pursued at random often changed with changing schools while book after book heavily taxing the parents purse is conned awhile and then supplanted by others teachers have usually so many pupils and such a variety of branches to teach that little time can be afforded to each pupil while scholars at this thoughtless period of life feeling sure of going to school as long as they please manifest little interest in their pursuits the writer believes that the actual amount of education permanently secured by most young ladies from the age of ten to fourteen could all be acquired in one year at the institution described by a young lady at the age of fifteen or sixteen instead of such a course as the common one if mothers would keep their daughters as their domestic assistants until they are fourteen requiring them to study one lesson and go out once a day to recite it to a teacher it would abundantly prepare them after their constitutions are firmly established to enter such an institution where in three years they could secure more than almost any young lady in the country now gains by giving the whole of her youth to school pursuits in the early years of female life reading writing needlework drawing and music should alternate with domestic duties and one hour a day devoted to some study in addition to the above pursuits would be all that is needful to prepare them for a thorough education after growth is attained and the constitution established this is the time when young women would feel the value of an education and pursue their studies with that maturity of mind and vividness of interest which would double the perpetuity and value of all their acquisitions the great difficulty which opposes such a plan is the want of institutions that would enable a young lady to complete in three years the liberal course of study here described but if american mothers become convinced of the importance of such advantages for their daughters and will use their influence appropriately and efficiently they will certainly be furnished there are other men of liberality and wealth besides the individual referred to who can be made to feel that a fortune expended in securing an appropriate education to american women is as wisely bestowed as in founding colleges for the other sex who are already so abundantly supplied we ought to have institutions similar to the one described in every part of this nation and funds should be provided for educating young women destitute of means and if american women think and feel that by such a method their own trials will be lightened and their daughters will secure a healthful constitution and a thorough domestic and intellectual education the appropriate expression of their wishes will secure the necessary funds the tide of charity which has been so long flowing from the female hand to provide a liberal education for young men will flow back with abundant remuneration the last method suggested for lessening the evils peculiar to american women is a decided effort to oppose the aristocratic feeling that labor is degrading and to bring about the impression that it is refined and ladylike to engage in domestic pursuits in past ages and in aristocratic countries leisure and indolence and frivolous pursuits have been deemed ladylike and refined because those classes which were most refined countenanced such an opinion but whenever ladies of refinement as a general custom patronise domestic pursuits then these employments will be deemed ladylike it may be urged however that it is impossible for a woman who cooks washes and sweeps to appear in the dress or acquire the habits and manners of a lady that the drudgery of the kitchen is dirty work and that no one can appear delicate and refined while engaged in it now all this depends on circumstances if a woman has a house destitute of neat and convenient facilities if she has no habits of order and system if she is remiss and careless in person and dressthen all this may be true but if a woman will make some sacrifices of costly ornaments in her parlor in order to make her kitchen neat and tasteful if she will sacrifice expensive dishes in order to secure such conveniences for labor as protect from exposures if she will take pains to have the dresses in which she works made of suitable materials and in good taste if she will rise early and systematize and oversee the work of her family so as to have it done thoroughly neatly and in the early part of the day she will find no necessity for any such apprehensions it is because such work has generally been done by vulgar people and in a vulgar way that we have such associations and when ladies manage such things as ladies should then such associations will be removed there are pursuits deemed very refined and genteel which involve quite as much exposure as kitchen employments for example to draw a large landscape in colored crayons would be deemed very ladylike but the writer can testify from sad experience that no cooking washing sweeping or any other domestic duty ever left such deplorable traces on hands face and dress as this same ladylike pursuit such things depend entirely on custom and associations and every american woman who values the institutions of her country and wishes to lend her influence in extending and perpetuating such blessings may feel that she is doing this whenever by her example and influence she destroys the aristocratic association which would render domestic labor degrading footnotes c the writer omits the name of this institution lest an inference should be drawn which would be unjust to other institutions there are others equally worthy of notice and the writer selects this only because her attention was especially directed to it as being in a new state and endowed wholly by an individual d from two greek wordsgreek kalos kalos beauty and greek sthenos sthenos strength being the union of both the writer is now preparing for the press an improved system of her own invention which in some of its parts has been successfully introduced into several female seminaries with advantage this plan combines singing with a great variety of amusing and graceful evolutions designed to promote both health and easy manners e this work which has gone through numerous editions and been received by the public with great favour forms no lxxxv of the family library and no lvii of the school district library issued by the publishers of this volume it is abundantly illustrated by engravings and has been extensively introduced as a school textbook chapter iv on domestic economy as a branch of study the greatest impediment to making domestic economy a branch of study is the fact that neither parents nor teachers realize the importance or the practicability of constituting it a regular part of school education it is with reference to this that the first aim of the writer will be to point out some of the reasons for introducing domestic economy as a branch of female education to be studied at school the first reason is that there is no period in a young ladys life when she will not find such knowledge useful to herself and to others the state of domestic service in this country is so precarious that there is scarcely a family in the free states of whom it can be affirmed that neither sickness discontent nor love of change will deprive them of all their domestics so that every female member of the family will be required to lend some aid in providing food and the conveniences of living and the better she is qualified to render it the happier she will be and the more she will contribute to the enjoyment of others a second reason is that every young lady at the close of her schooldays and even before they are closed is liable to be placed in a situation in which she will need to do herself or to teach others to do all the various processes and duties detailed in this work that this may be more fully realized the writer will detail some instances which have come under her own observation the eldest daughter of a family returned from school on a visit at sixteen years of age before her vacation had closed her mother was laid in the grave and such were her fathers circumstances that she was obliged to assume the cares and duties of her lost parent the care of an infant the management of young children the superintendence of domestics the charge of family expenses the responsibility of entertaining company and the many other cares of the family state all at once came upon this young and inexperienced schoolgirl again a young lady went to reside with a married sister in a distant state while on this visit the elder sister died and there was no one but this young lady to fill the vacant place and assume all the cares of the nursery parlor and kitchen again a pupil of the writer at the end of her schooldays married and removed to the west she was an entire novice in all domestic matters an utter stranger in the place to which she removed in a year she became a mother and her health failed while for most of the time she had no domestics at all or only irish or germans who scarcely knew even the names or the uses of many cooking utensils she was treated with politeness by her neighbors and wished to return their civilities but how could this young and delicate creature who had spent all her life at school or in visiting and amusement take care of her infant attend to her cooking washing ironing and baking the concerns of her parlor chambers kitchen and cellar and yet visit and receive company if there is any thing that would make a kindly heart ache with sorrow and sympathy it would be to see so young so amiable so helpless a martyr to the mistaken system of female education now prevalent i have the kindest of husbands said the young wife after her narrative of sufferings and i never regretted my marriage but since this babe was born i have never had a single waking hour of freedom from anxiety and care o how little young girls know what is before them when they enter married life let the mother or teacher whose eye may rest on these lines ask herself if there is no cause for fear that the young objects of her care may be thrown into similar emergencies where they may need a kind of preparation which as yet has been withheld another reason for introducing such a subject as a distinct branch of school education is that as a general fact young ladies will not be taught these things in any other way in reply to the thousandtimesrepeated remark that girls must be taught their domestic duties by their mothers at home it may be inquired in the first place what proportion of mothers are qualified to teach a proper and complete system of domestic economy when this is answered it may be asked what proportion of those who are qualified have that sense of the importance of such instructions and that energy and perseverance which would enable them actually to teach their daughters in all the branches of domestic economy presented in this work it may then be asked how many mothers actually do give their daughters instruction in the various branches of domestic economy is it not the case that owing to ill health deficiency of domestics and multiplied cares and perplexities a large portion of the most intelligent mothers and those too who most realize the importance of this instruction actually cannot find the time and have not the energy necessary to properly perform the duty they are taxed to the full amount of both their mental and physical energies and cannot attempt any thing more almost every woman knows that it is easier to do the work herself than it is to teach an awkward and careless novice and the great majority of women in this country are obliged to do almost every thing in the shortest and easiest way this is one reason why the daughters of very energetic and accomplished housekeepers are often the most deficient in these respects while the daughters of ignorant or inefficient mothers driven to the exercise of their own energies often become the most systematic and expert it may be objected that such things cannot be taught by books this position may fairly be questioned do not young ladies learn from books how to make hydrogen and oxygen do they not have pictures of furnaces alembics and the various utensils employed in cooking the chemical agents do they not study the various processes of mechanics and learn to understand and to do many as difficult operations as any that belong to housekeeping all these things are explained studied and recited in classes when every one knows that little practical use can ever be made of this knowledge why then should not that science and art which a woman is to practise during her whole life be studied and recited it may be urged that even if it is studied it will soon be forgotten and so will much of every thing studied at school but why should that knowledge most needful for daily comfort most liable to be in demand be the only study omitted because it may be forgotten it may also be objected that young ladies can get such books and attend to them out of school and so they can get books on chemistry and philosophy and study them out of school but will they do it and why ought we not to make sure of the most necessary knowledge and let the less needful be omitted if young ladies study such a work as this in school they will remember a great part of it and when they forget in any emergency they will know where to resort for instruction but if such books are not put into schools probably not one in twenty will see or hear of them especially in those retired places where they are most needed and is it at all probable that a branch which is so lightly esteemed as to be deemed unworthy a place in the list of female studies will be sought for and learned by young girls who so seldom look into works of solid instruction after they leave school so deeply is the writer impressed with the importance of this as a branch of female education at school that she would deem it far safer and wiser to omit any other rather than this another reason for introducing such a branch of study into female schools is the influence it would exert in leading young ladies more correctly to estimate the importance and dignity of domestic knowledge it is now often the case that young ladies rather pride themselves on their ignorance of such subjects and seem to imagine that it is vulgar and ungenteel to know how to work this is one of the relics of an aristocratic state of society which is fast passing away here the tendency of every thing is to the equalisation of labor so that all classes are feeling more and more that indolence is disreputable and there are many mothers among the best educated and most wealthy classes who are bringing up their daughters not only to know how to do but actually to do all kinds of domestic work the writer knows young ladies who are daughters of men of wealth and standing and who are among the most accomplished in their sphere who have for months been sent to work with a mantuamaker to acquire a practical knowledge of her occupation and who have at home learned to perform all kinds of domestic labor and let the young women of this nation find that domestic economy is placed in schools on equal or superior ground to chemistry philosophy and mathematics and they will blush to be found ignorant of its first principles as much as they will to hesitate respecting the laws of gravity or the composition of the atmosphere but as matters are now conducted many young ladies know how to make oxygen and hydrogen and to discuss questions of philosophy or political economy far better than they know how to make a bed and sweep a room properly and they can construct a diagram in geometry with far more skill than they can make the simplest article of female dress it may be urged that the plan suggested by the writer in the previous pages would make such a book as this needless for young ladies would learn all these things at home before they go to school but it must be remembered that the plan suggested cannot fully be carried into effect till such endowed institutions as the one described are universally furnished this probably will not be done till at least one generation of young women are educated it is only on the supposition that a young lady can at fourteen or fifteen years of age enter such an institution and continue there three years that it would be easy to induce her to remain during all the previous period at home in the practice of domestic economy and the limited course of study pointed out in the present imperfect desultory varying mode of female education where studies are begun changed partially learned and forgotten it requires nearly all the years of a womans youth to acquire the intellectual education now demanded while this state of things continues the only remedy is to introduce domestic economy as a study at school it is hoped that these considerations will have weight not only with parents and teachers but with young ladies themselves and that all will unite their influence to introduce this as a popular and universal branch of education into every female school chapter v on the care of health there is no point where a woman is more liable to suffer from a want of knowledge and experience than in reference to the health of a family committed to her care many a young lady who never had any charge of the sick who never took any care of an infant who never obtained information on these subjects from books or from the experience of others in short with little or no preparation has found herself the principal attendant in dangerous sickness the chief nurse of a feeble infant and the responsible guardian of the health of a whole family the care the fear the perplexity of a woman suddenly called to these unwonted duties none can realize till they themselves feel it or till they see some young and anxious novice first attempting to meet such responsibilities to a woman of age and experience these duties often involve a measure of trial and difficulty at times deemed almost insupportable how hard then must they press on the heart of the young and inexperienced there is no really efficacious mode of preparing a woman to take a rational care of the health of a family except by communicating that knowledge in regard to the construction of the body and the laws of health which is the basis of the medical profession not that a woman should undertake the minute and extensive investigation requisite for a physician but she should gain a general knowledge of first principles as a guide to her judgement in emergencies when she can rely on no other aid therefore before attempting to give any specific directions on the subject of this chapter a short sketch of the construction of the human frame will be given with a notice of some of the general principles on which specific rules in regard to health are based this description will be arranged under the general heads of bones muscles nerves bloodvessels organs of digestion and respiration and the skin bones the bones are the most solid parts of the body they are designed to protect and sustain it and also to secure voluntary motion they are about two hundred and fifty in number there being sometimes a few more or less and are fastened together by cartilage or gristle a substance like the bones but softer and more elastic in order to convey a more clear and correct idea of the form relative position and connection of the bones constituting the human framework the engraving on page 70 fig 1 is given illustration fig 1 by the preceding engraving it will be seen that the cranium or skull consists of several distinct pieces which are united by sutures or seams as represented by the zigzag lines a being the frontal bone b the parietal bone c the temporal bone and d the place of the occipital bone which forms the back part of the head and therefore is not seen in the engraving the nasal bones or bones of the nose are shown at e f is the cheek bone g the upper and h the lower jaw bones i i the spinal column or back bone consisting of numerous small bones called vertebr j j the seven true ribs which are fastened to the spine behind and by the cartilages k k to the sternum or breast bone l in front m m are the first three false ribs which are so called because they are not united directly to the breast bone but by cartilages to the seventh true rib n n are the lower two false which are also called floating ribs because they are not connected with the breast bone nor the other ribs in front o o p q are the bones of the pelvis which is the foundation on which the spine rests r r are the collar bones s s the shoulder blades t t the bones of the upper arm u u the elbow joints where the bones of the upper arm and fore arm are united in such a way that they can move like a hinge v w v w are the bones of the fore arm x x those of the wrists y y those of the fingers z z are the round heads of the thigh bones where they are inserted into the sockets of the bones of the pelvis giving motion in every direction and forming the hip joint a b a b are the thigh bones c c the knee joints d e d e the leg bones f f the ankle joints g g the bones of the foot the bones are composed of two substancesone animal and the other mineral the animal part is a very fine network called the cellular membrane in this are deposited the harder mineral substances which are composed principally of carbonate and phosphate of lime in very early life the bones consist chiefly of the animal part and are then soft and pliant as the child advances in age the bones grow harder by the gradual deposition of the phosphate of lime which is supplied by the food and carried to the bones by the blood in old age the hardest material preponderates making the bones more brittle than in earlier life as we shall soon have occasion to refer particularly to the spinal or vertebral column and the derangement to which it is liable we give on page 72 representations of the different classes of vertebr viz the cervical from the latin cervix the neck the dorsal from dorsum the back and lumbar from lumbus the loins illustration fig 2 fig 2 represents one of the cervical vertebr seven of these placed one above another constitute that part of the spine which is in the neck illustration fig 3 fig 3 is one of the dorsal vertebr twelve of which form the central part of the spine illustration fig 4 fig 4 represents one of the lumbar vertebr five in number which are immediately above the sacrum these vertebr are so fastened that the spine can bend in any direction and the muscles of the trunk are used in holding it erect or in varying its movements by the drawings here presented it will be seen that the vertebr of the neck back and loins differ somewhat in size and shape although they all possess the same constituent parts thus a in each represents the body of the vertebr b the articulating processes by which each is joined to its fellow above and below it c the spinous process or that part of the vertebr which forms the ridge to be felt on pressure the whole length of the centre of the back the back bone receives its name spine or spinal column from these spinous processes it is the universal law of the human frame that exercise is indispensable to the health of the several parts thus if a bloodvessel be tied up so as not to be used it shrinks and becomes a useless string if a muscle be condemned to inaction it shrinks in size and diminishes in power and thus it is also with the bones inactivity produces softness debility and unfitness for the functions they are designed to perform this is one of the causes of the curvature of the spine that common and pernicious defect in the females of america from inactivity the bones of the spine become soft and yielding and then if the person is often placed for a length of time in positions that throw the weight of the body unequally on certain portions of the spine they yield to this frequent compression and a distortion ensues the positions taken by young persons when learning to write or draw or to play on the guitar harp or piano and the position of the body when sleeping on one side on high pillows all tend to produce this effect by throwing the weight of the body unequally and for a length of time on particular parts of the spine illustration fig 5 muscles the muscles are the chief organs of motion and consist of collections of fine fibres or strings united in casings of membrane or thin skin they possess an elastic power like india rubber which enables them to extend and contract the red meat in animals consists of muscles every muscle has connected with it nerves veins and arteries and those designed to move the bones are fastened to them by tendons at their extremities the muscles are laid over each other and are separated by means of membranes and layers of fat which enable them to move easily without interfering with each other the figure on page 74 represents the muscles of the arm as they appear when the skin and fat are removed the muscles a and b are attached at their upper ends to the bone of the arm and by their lower ends to the upper part of the fore arm near the elbow joint when the fibres of these muscles contract the middle part of them grows larger and the arm is bent at the elbow the muscle c is in like manner fastened by its upper end to the shoulder blade and the upper part of the arm and by its lower end to one of the bones of the fore arm near the elbow when the arm is bent and we wish to straighten it it is done by contracting this muscle the muscles d d are fastened at one end near the elbow joint and at the other near the ends of the fingers and on the back of the hand are reduced in size appearing like strong cords these cords are called tendons they are employed in straightening the fingers when the hand is shut these tendons are confined by the ligament or band e which binds them down around the wrist and thus enables them to act more efficiently and secures beauty of form to the limb the muscles at f are those which enable us to turn the hand and arm outward every different motion of the arm has one muscle to produce it and another to restore the limb to its natural position those muscles which bend the body are called flexors those which straighten it extensors when the arm is thrown up one set of muscles is used to pull it down another set when it is thrown forward a still different set is used when it is thrown back another different from the former when the arm turns in its socket still another set is used and thus every different motion of the body is made by a different set of muscles all these muscles are compactly and skilfully arranged so as to work with perfect ease among them run the arteries veins and nerves which supply each muscle with blood and nervous power as will be hereafter described the size and strength of the muscles depend greatly on their frequent exercise if left inactive they grow thin and weak instead of giving the plumpness to the figure designed by nature the delicate and feeble appearance of many american women is chiefly owing to the little use they make of their muscles many a pale puny shadshaped girl would have become a plump rosy wellformed person if half the exercise afforded to her brothers in the open air had been secured to her during childhood and youth nerves the nerves are the organs of sensation they enable us to see hear feel taste and smell and also combine with the bones and muscles in producing motion the first engraving on p 77 fig 6 is a vertical section of the skull and of the spinal column or back bone which supports the head and through which runs the spinal cord whence most of the nerves originate it is a side view and represents the head and spine as they would appear if they were cut through the middle from front to back fig 7 exhibits them as they would appear if viewed from behind in fig 6 a represents the cerebrum or great brain b the cerebellum or little brain which is situated directly under the great brain at the back and lower part of the head c d e is the spinal marrow which is connected with the brain at c and runs through the whole length of the spinal column this column consists as has already been stated of a large number of small bones f f called vertebr laid one above another and fastened together by cartilage or gristle g between them illustration fig 6 illustration fig 7 between each two vertebr or spinal bones there issues from the spine on each side a pair of nerves the lower broad part of the spine see p fig 1 p 70 and fig 7 p 77 is called the sacrum in this are eight holes through which the lower pairs of nerves pass off the nerves of the head and lungs run directly from the brain those of all other parts of the body proceed from the spine passing out in the manner already mentioned the nerves which thus proceed from the spine branch out like the limbs and twigs of a tree till they extend over the whole body and so minutely are they divided and arranged that a point destitute of a nerve cannot be found on the skin some idea of the ramifications of the nerves may be obtained by reference to the following engraving fig 8 in this a a represents the cerebrum or great brain b b the cerebellum or little brain see also a b in fig 6 c c represents the union of the fibres of the cerebrum d d the union of the two sides of the cerebellum e e e the spinal marrow which passes through the centre of the spine as seen at c d e in fig 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 branches of the nerves going to different parts of the body as the nerves are the organs of sensation all pain is an affection of some portion of the nerves the health of the nerves depends very greatly on the exercise of the muscles with which they are so intimately connected this shows the reason why the headache tic douloureux diseases of the spine and other nervous affections are so common among american women their inactive habits engender a debility of the nervous system and these diseases follow as the consequence illustration fig 8 it can be seen by a reference to the side view represented on page 77 fig 6 that the spine is naturally curved back and forward when from want of exercise its bones are softened and the muscles weakened the spine acquires an improper curve and the person becomes what is called crooked having the neck projected forward and in some cases having the back convex where it should be concave probably one half of the american women have the head thus projecting forward instead of carrying it in the natural erect position which is both graceful and dignified the curvature of the spine spoken of in this work as so common and as the cause of so many diseases among american women is what is denominated the lateral curvature and is much more dangerous than the other distortion the indications of this evil are the projection of one shoulder blade more than the other and in bad cases one shoulder being higher and the hip on the opposite side more projecting than the other in this case the spine when viewed from behind instead of running in a straight line as in fig 7 and 9 is curved somewhat as may be seen in figures 10 and 11 this effect is occasioned by the softness of the bones induced by want of exercise together with tight dressing which tends to weaken the muscles that are thus thrown out of use improper and long continued positions in drawing writing and sleeping which throw the weight of the body on one part of the spine induce the same evil this distortion is usually accompanied with some consequent disease of the nervous system or some disarrangement of the internal organs by comparing figures 9 and 11 the difference between a natural and distorted spine will be readily perceived in fig 10 the curved line shows the course of the spine occasioned by distortion the perpendicular line in this and fig 11 indicates the true direction of the spine the horizontal lines show that one shoulder and hip are forced from their proper level illustration fig 9 illustration fig 10 illustration fig 11 bloodvessels the blood is the fluid into which our food is changed and which is employed to minister nourishment to the whole body for this purpose it is carried to every part of the body by the arteries and after it has given out its nourishment returns to the heart through the veins the subjoined engraving fig 12 which presents a rude outline of the vascular system will more clearly illustrate this operation as we shall presently show illustration fig 12 before entering the heart the blood receives a fresh supply of nourishment by a duct which leads from the stomach the arteries have their origin from the heart in a great trunk called the aorta which is the parent of all the arteries as the spinal marrow is the parent of the nerves which it sends out when the arteries have branched out into myriads of minute vessels the blood which is in them passes into as minute veins and these run into each other like the rills and branches of a river until they are all united in two great veins which run into the heart one of these large receivers called the vena cava superior or upper vena cava brings back the blood from the arms and head the other the vena cava inferior or lower vena cava brings back the blood from the body and lower limbs in the preceding figure h is the heart which is divided into four compartments two called auricles used for receiving the blood and two called ventricles used for sending out the blood a is the aorta or great artery which sends its branches to every part of the body in the upper part at a a a are the main branches of the aorta which go to the head and arms below at a a are the branches which go to the lower limbs the branches which set off at x x are those by which the intestines are supplied by vessels from the aorta every muscle in the whole body all the organs of the body and the skin are supplied by branches sent off from this great artery when the blood is thus dispersed through any organ in minute vessels it is received at their terminations by numerous minute veins which gradually unite forming larger branches till they all meet in either the upper or lower vena cava which returns the blood to the heart v i is the vena cava inferior which receives the blood from the veins of the lower parts of the body as seen at v v the blood sent into the lower limbs from the aorta is received by minute veins which finally unite at v v and thus it is emptied through the lower vena cava into the heart o o represent the points of entrance of those tributaries of the vena cava which receive that blood from the intestines which is sent out by the aorta at x x in the upper part v s is the vena cava superior which receives the blood from the head and arms v v v are the tributaries of the upper vena cava which bring the blood back from the head and arms d d represents the course of the thoracic duct a delicate tube by which the chyle is carried into the blood as mentioned on page 89 t shows the place where this duct empties into a branch of the vena cava it thus appears that wherever a branch of the aorta goes to carry blood there will be found a tributary of the upper or lower vena cava to bring it back the succeeding engravings will enable the reader to form a more definite idea of this important function of the systemthe circulation of the blood the heart in man and in all warmblooded animals is double having two auricles and two ventricles in animals with cold blood as fishes the heart is single having but one auricle and one ventricle fig 13 represents the double heart as it appears when the two sides are separated and also the great bloodvessels those on the left of the figure being on the right side of the body and vice versa the direction of the blood is represented by the arrows a represents the lower vena cava returning the blood from the lower parts of the body and l the upper vena cava returning the blood from the head and arms b is the right sinus or auricle into which the returned blood is poured from this cavity of the heart the blood is carried into the right ventricle c and from this ventricle the pulmonary arteries d convey into the lungs the blood which is returned from the body these five vessels a b c d and l belong to the right side of the heart and contain the venous or darkcolored blood which has been through the circulation and is now unfit for the uses of the system till it has passed through the lungs illustration fig 13 when the blood reaches the lungs and is exposed to the action of the air which we breathe it throws off its impurities becomes bright in color and is then called arterial blood it then returns to the left side of the heart on the right of the engraving by the pulmonary veins e e also seen at m m fig 15 into the left auricle f whence it is forced into the ventricle g from the left ventricle proceeds the aorta h h which is the great artery of the body and conveys the blood to every part of the system i j k are branches of the aorta going to the head and arms illustration fig 14 fig 14 represents the heart with its two sides united as in nature and will be understood from the description of fig 13 on the opposite page fig 15 represents the heart with the great bloodvessels on a still larger scale a being the left ventricle b the right ventricle c e f the aorta or great artery rising out of the left ventricle g h i the branches of the aorta going to the head and arms k l l the pulmonary artery and its branches m m veins of the lungs which bring the blood back from the lungs to the heart n right auricle o vena cava inferior p veins returning blood from the liver and bowels q the vena cava superior r the left auricle s the left coronary artery which distributes the blood exclusively to the substance of the heart illustration fig 15 organs of digestion and respiration digestion and respiration are the processes by which the food is converted into blood for the nourishment of the body the engraving on the next page fig 16 shows the organs by which these operations are performed in the lower part of the engraving is the stomach marked s which receives the food through the gullet marked g the latter though in the engraving it is cut off at g in reality continues upwards to the throat the stomach is a bag composed of muscles nerves and bloodvessels united by a material similar to that which forms the skin as soon as food enters the stomach its nerves are excited to perform their proper function of stimulating the muscles a muscular called the peristaltic motion immediately commences by which the stomach propels its contents around the whole of its circumference once in every three minutes illustration fig 16 this movement of the muscles attracts the blood from other parts of the system for the blood always hastens to administer its supplies to any organ which is called to work the bloodvessels of the stomach are soon distended with blood from which the gastric juice is secreted by minute vessels in the coat of the stomach this mixes with the food and reduces it to a soft pulpy mass called chyme it then passes through the lower end of the stomach into the intestines which are folded up in the abdomen and the upper portion only of which is shown in the engraving at a a the organ marked l l is the liver which as the blood passes through its many vessels secretes a substance called bile which accumulates in the gallbladder marked b after the food passes out of the stomach it receives from the liver a portion of bile and from the pancreas the pancreatic juice the pancreas does not appear in this drawing being concealed behind the stomach these two liquids separate the substance which has passed from the stomach into two different portions one is a light liquid very much like cream in appearance and called chyle of which the blood is formed the other is a more solid substance which contains the refuse and useless matter with a smaller portion of nourishment and this after being further separated from the nourishing matter which it contains is thrown out of the body there are multitudes of small vessels called lacteals which as these two mixed substances pass through the long and winding folds of the intestines in the abdomen absorb the chyle and convey it to the thoracic duct which runs up close by the spine and carries the chyle thus received into a branch of the vena cava superior at t whence it is mingled with the blood going into the heart in this engraving the lacteals and thoracic duct are not shown but their position is indicated by the dotted lines marked x y x being the lacteals and y the thoracic duct in the upper half of the engraving h represents the heart a the commencement of the aorta v c s the termination of the vena cava superior on each side of the heart are the lungs l l being the left lobe and r l the right lobe they are composed of a network of airvessels bloodvessels and nerves w represents the trachea or windpipe through which the air we breathe is conducted to the lungs it branches out into myriads of minute vessels which are thus filled with air every time we breathe from the heart run the pulmonary arteries marked p a these enter the lungs and spread out alongside of the branches of the airvessels so that every airvessel has a small artery running side by side with it when the two vena cavas empty the blood into the heart the latter contracts and sends this blood through these pulmonary arteries into the lungs as the air and blood meander side by side through the lungs the superabundant carbon and hydrogen of the blood combine with the oxygen of the air forming carbonic acid gas and water which are thrown out of the lungs at every expiration this is the process by which the chyle is converted into arterial blood and the venous blood purified of its excess of carbon and hydrogen when the blood is thus prepared in the lungs for its duties it is received by the small pulmonary veins which gradually unite and bring the blood back to the heart through the large pulmonary veins marked p v p v on receiving this purified blood from the lungs the heart contracts and sends it out again through the aorta to all parts of the body it then makes another circuit through every part ministering to the wants of all and is afterwards again brought back by the veins to receive the fresh chyle from the stomach and to be purified by the lungs the throbbing of the heart is caused by its alternate expansion and contraction as it receives and expels the blood with one throb the blood is sent from the right ventricle into the lungs and from the left ventricle into the aorta every time we inspire air the process of purifying the blood is going on and every time we expire the air we throw out the redundant carbon and hydrogen taken from a portion of the blood if the waist is compressed by tight clothing a portion of the lungs be compressed so that the airvessels cannot be filled this prevents the perfect purification and preparation of the blood so that a part returns back to the heart unfitted for its duties this is a slow but sure method by which the constitution of many a young lady is so undermined that she becomes an early victim to disease and to the decay of beauty and strength the want of pure air is another cause of the debility of the female constitution when air has been rendered impure by the breath of several persons or by close confinement it does not purify the blood properly sleeping in close chambers and sitting in crowded and unventilated schoolrooms are frequent causes of debility in the constitution of young persons of the skin the skin is the covering of the body and has very important functions to perform it is more abundantly supplied with nerves and bloodvessels than any other part and there is no spot of the skin where the point of the finest needle would not pierce a nerve and bloodvessel indeed it may be considered as composed chiefly of an interlacing of minute nerves and bloodvessels so that it is supposed there is more nervous matter in the skin than in all the rest of the body united and that the greater portion of the blood flows through the skin the whole animal system is in a state of continual change and renovation food is constantly taken into the stomach only a portion of which is fitted for the supply of the blood all the rest has to be thrown out of the system by various organs designed for this purpose these organs arethe lungs which throw off a portion of useless matter when the blood is purified the kidneys which secrete liquids that pass into the bladder and are thrown out from the body by that organ and the intestines which carry off the useless and more solid parts of the food after the lacteals have drawn off the chyle in addition to these organs the skin has a similar duty to perform and as it has so much larger a supply of blood it is the chief organ in relieving the body of the useless and noxious parts of the materials which are taken for food various experiments show that not less than a pound and four ounces of waste matter is thrown off by the skin every twentyfour hours this is according to the lowest calculation most of those who have made experiments to ascertain the quantity represent it as much greater and all agree that the skin throws off more redundant matter from the body than the whole of the other organs together in the ordinary state of the skin even when there is no apparent perspiration it is constantly exhaling waste matter in a form which is called insensible perspiration because it cannot be perceived by the senses a very cool mirror brought suddenly near to the skin will be covered in that part with a moisture which is this effluvium thus made visible when heat or exercise excites the skin this perspiration is increased so as to be apparent to the senses this shows the reason why it is so important frequently to wash the entire surface of the body if this be neglected the pores of the skin are closed by the waste matter thrown from the body and by small particles of the thin scarfskin so that it cannot properly perform its duties in this way the other organs are made to work harder in order to perform the labor the skin would otherwise accomplish and thus the lungs and bowels are often essentially weakened another office of the skin is to regulate the heat of the body the action of the internal organs is constantly generating heat and the faster the blood circulates the greater is the heat evolved the perspiration of the skin serves to reduce and regulate this heat for whenever any liquid changes to a vapor it absorbs heat from whatever is nearest to it the faster the blood flows the more perspiration is evolved this bedews the skin with a liquid which the heat of the body turns to a vapor and in this change that heat is absorbed when a fever takes place this perspiration ceases and the body is afflicted with heat insensible perspiration is most abundant during sleep after eating and when friction is applied to the skin perspiration is performed by the terminations of minute arteries in every part of the skin which exude the perspiration from the blood the skin also performs another function it is provided with a set of small vessels called absorbents which are exceedingly abundant and minute when particular substances are brought in contact with the skin these absorbents take up some portions and carry them into the blood it is owing to this that opium applied on the skin acts in a manner similar to its operation when taken into the stomach the power of absorption is increased by friction and this is the reason that liniments are employed with much rubbing to bruises and sprains the substance applied is thus introduced into the injured part through the absorbents this shows another reason for frequent washing of the skin and for the frequent changes of the garment next the skin otherwise portions of the noxious matter thrown out by the skin are reabsorbed into the blood and are slow but sure causes of a decay of the strength of the system the skin is also provided with small follicles or bags which are filled with an oily substance this by gradually exuding over the skin prevents water from penetrating and injuring its texture the skin is also the organ of touch this office is performed through the instrumentality of the nerves of feeling which are spread over all parts of the skin this general outline of the construction of the human frame is given with reference to the practical application of this knowledge in the various cases where a woman will be called upon to exercise her own unaided judgement the application will be further pointed out in the chapters on food dress cleanliness care of the sick and care of infants chapter vi on healthful food the person who decides what shall be the food and drink of a family and the modes of preparation is the one who decides to a greater or less extent what shall be the health of that family it is the opinion of most medical men that intemperance in eating is the most fruitful of all causes of disease and death if this be so the woman who wisely adapts the food and cooking of her family to the laws of health removes the greatest risk which threatens the lives of those under her care to exhibit this subject clearly it will be needful to refer more minutely to the organization and operation of the digestive organs it is found by experiment that the supply of gastric juice furnished from the blood by the arteries of the stomach is proportioned not to the amount of food put into the stomach but to the wants of the body so that it is possible to put much more into the stomach than can be digested to guide and regulate in this matter the sensation called hunger is provided in a healthy state of the body as soon as the blood has lost its nutritive supplies the craving of hunger is felt and then if the food is suitable and is taken in the proper manner this sensation ceases as soon as the stomach has received enough to supply the wants of the system but our benevolent creator in this as in our other duties has connected enjoyment with the operation needful to sustain our bodies in addition to the allaying of hunger the gratification of the palate is secured by the immense variety of food some articles of which are far more agreeable than others this arrangement of providence designed for our happiness has become either through ignorance or want of selfcontrol the chief cause of the various diseases and sufferings which afflict those classes who have the means of seeking a variety to gratify the palate if mankind had only one article of food and only water to drink though they would have less enjoyment in eating they would never be tempted to put any more into the stomach than the calls of hunger required but the customs of society which present an incessant change and a great variety of food with those various condiments which stimulate appetite lead almost every person very frequently to eat merely to gratify the palate after the stomach has been abundantly supplied so that hunger has ceased when too great a supply of food is put into the stomach the gastric juice dissolves only that portion which the wants of the system demand the remainder is ejected in an unprepared state the absorbents take portions of it into the system and all the various functions of the body which depend on the ministries of the blood are thus gradually and imperceptibly injured very often intemperance in eating produces immediate results such as colic headaches pains of indigestion and vertigo but the more general result is a gradual undermining of all parts of the human frame thus imperceptibly shortening life by so weakening the constitution that it is ready to yield at every point to any uncommon risk or exposure thousands and thousands are passing out of the world from diseases occasioned by exposures which a healthy constitution could meet without any danger it is owing to these considerations that it becomes the duty of every woman who has the responsibility of providing food for a family to avoid a variety of tempting dishes it is a much safer rule to have only one kind of healthy food for each meal than the abundant variety which is usually met at the tables of almost all classes in this country when there is to be any variety of dishes they ought not to be successive but so arranged as to give the opportunity of selection how often is it the case that persons by the appearance of a favorite article are tempted to eat merely to gratify the palate when the stomach is already adequately supplied all such intemperance wears on the constitution and shortens life it not unfrequently happens that excess in eating produces a morbid appetite which must constantly be denied but the organization of the digestive organs demands not only that food be taken in proper quantities but that it be taken at proper times it has before been shown that as soon as the food enters the stomach the muscles are excited by the nerves and the peristaltic motion commences this is a powerful and constant exercise of the muscles of the stomach which continues until the process of digestion is complete during this time the blood is withdrawn from other parts of the system to supply the demands of the stomach which is laboring hard with all its muscles when this motion ceases and the digested food has gradually passed out of the stomach nature requires that it should have a period of repose and if another meal be eaten immediately after one is digested the stomach is set to work again before it has had time to rest and before a sufficient supply of gastric juice is provided the general rule then is that three hours be given to the stomach for labor and two for rest and in obedience to this five hours at least ought to elapse between every two regular meals in cases where exercise produces a flow of perspiration more food is needed to supply the loss and strong laboring men may safely eat as often as they feel the want of food so young and healthy children who gambol and exercise much and whose bodies grow fast may have a more frequent supply of food but as a general rule meals should be five hours apart and eating between meals avoided there is nothing more unsafe and wearing to the constitution than a habit of eating at any time merely to gratify the palate when a tempting article is presented every person should exercise sufficient selfdenial to wait till the proper time for eating arrives children as well as grown persons are often injured by eating between their regular meals thus weakening the stomach by not affording it any time for rest in deciding as to quantity of food there is one great difficulty to be met by a large portion of the community it has been shown that the exercise of every part of the body is indispensable to its health and perfection the bones the muscles the nerves the organs of digestion and respiration and the skin all demand exercise in order properly to perform their functions when the muscles of the body are called into action all the bloodvessels entwined among them are frequently compressed as the arteries are so contrived that the blood cannot run back this compression hastens it forward through the veins towards that organ the heart is immediately put in quicker motion to send it into the lungs and they also are thus stimulated to more rapid action which is the cause of that panting which active exercise always occasions the blood thus courses with greater celerity through the body and sooner loses its nourishing properties then the stomach issues its mandate of hunger and a new supply of food must be furnished thus it appears as a general rule that the quantity of food actually needed by the body depends on the amount of muscular exercise taken a laboring man in the open fields probably throws off from his skin ten times the amount of perspirable matter which is evolved from the skin of a person of sedentary pursuits in consequence of this he demands a far greater amount of food and drink those persons who keep their bodies in a state of health by sufficient exercise can always be guided by the calls of hunger they can eat when they feel hungry and stop when hunger ceases and then they will calculate exactly right but the difficulty is that a large part of the community especially women are so inactive in their habits that they seldom feel the calls of hunger they habitually eat merely to gratify the palate this produces such a state of the system that they have lost the guide which nature has provided they are not called to eat by hunger nor admonished by its cessation when to stop in consequence of this such persons eat what pleases the palate till they feel no more inclination for the article it is probable that three fourths of the women in the wealthier circles sit down to each meal without any feeling of hunger and eat merely on account of the gratification thus afforded them such persons find their appetite to depend almost solely upon the kind of food on the table this is not the case with those who take the exercise which nature demands they approach their meals in such a state that almost any kind of food is acceptable the question then arises how are persons who have lost the guide which nature has provided to determine as to the proper amount of food they shall take the only rules they can adopt are of a general nature founded on the principles already developed they should endeavor to proportion their food to the amount of the exercise they ordinarily take if they take but little exercise they should eat but little food in comparison with those who are much in the open air and take much exercise and their food should be chiefly vegetable and not animal but how often is it seen that a student or a man who sits all day in an office or a lady who spends the day in her parlor and chamber will sit down to a loaded table and by continuing to partake of the tempting varieties in the end load the stomach with a supply which a stout farmer could scarcely digest but the health of a family depends not merely on the quantity of food taken but very much also on the quality some kinds of food are very pernicious in their nature and some healthful articles are rendered very injurious by the mode of cooking persons who have a strong constitution and take much exercise may eat almost any thing with apparent impunity but young children who are forming their constitutions and persons who are delicate and who take but little exercise are very dependent for health on a proper selection of food there are some general principles which may aid in regulating the judgement on this subject it is found that there are some kinds of food which afford nutriment to the blood and do not produce any other effect on the system there are other kinds which are not only nourishing but stimulating so that they quicken the functions of the organs on which they operate the condiments used in cookery such as pepper mustard and spices are of this nature there are certain states of the system when these stimulants are beneficial but it is only in cases where there is some debility such cases can only be pointed out by medical men but persons in perfect health and especially young children never receive any benefit from such kind of food and just in proportion as condiments operate to quicken the labors of the internal organs they tend to wear down their powers a person who thus keeps the body working under an unnatural excitement lives faster than nature designed and the sooner the constitution is worn out a woman therefore should provide dishes for her family which are free from these stimulating condiments and as much as possible prevent their use it is also found by experience that animal food is more stimulating than vegetable this is the reason why in cases of fevers or inflammations medical men forbid the use of meat and butter animal food supplies chyle much more abundantly than vegetable food does and this chyle is more stimulating in its nature of course a person who lives chiefly on animal food is under a higher degree of stimulus than if his food was chiefly composed of vegetable substances his blood will flow faster and all the functions of his body will be quickened this makes it important to secure a proper proportion of animal and vegetable diet some medical men suppose that an exclusively vegetable diet is proved by the experience of many individuals to be fully sufficient to nourish the body and bring as evidence the fact that some of the strongest and most robust men in the world are those who are trained from infancy exclusively on vegetable food from this they infer that life will be shortened just in proportion as the diet is changed to more stimulating articles and that all other things being equal children will have a better chance of health and long life if they are brought up solely on vegetable food but though this is not the common opinion of medical men they all agree that in america far too large a portion of the diet consists of animal food as a nation the americans are proverbial for the gross and luxurious diet with which they load their tables and there can be no doubt that the general health of the nation would be increased by a change in our customs in this respect to take meat but once a day and this in small quantities compared with the common practice is a rule the observance of which would probably greatly reduce the amount of fevers eruptions headaches bilious attacks and the many other ailments which are produced or aggravated by too gross a diet the celebrated roman physician baglivi who from practising extensively among roman catholics had ample opportunities to observe mentions that in italy an unusual number of people recover their health in the forty days of lent in consequence of the lower diet which is required as a religious duty an american physician remarks for every reeling drunkard that disgraces our country it contains one hundred gluttonspersons i mean who eat to excess and suffer in consequence another distinguished physician says i believe that every stomach not actually impaired by organic disease will perform its functions if it receives reasonable attention and when we perceive the manner in which diet is generally conducted both in regard to quantity and variety of articles of food and drink which are mixed up in one heterogeneous massinstead of being astonished at the prevalence of indigestion our wonder must rather be that in such circumstances any stomach is capable of digesting at all in regard to articles which are the most easily digested only general rules can be given tender meats are digested more readily than those which are tough or than many kinds of vegetable food the farinaceous articles such as rice flour corn potatoes and the like are the most nutritious and most easily digested the popular notion that meat is more nourishing than bread is a great mistake good bread contains one third more nourishment than butchers meat the meat is more stimulating and for this reason is more readily digested a perfectly healthy stomach can digest almost any healthful food but when the digestive powers are weak every stomach has its peculiarities and what is good for one is hurtful to another in such cases experiment alone can decide which are the most digestible articles of food a person whose food troubles him must deduct one article after another till he learns by experience which is the best for digestion much evil has been done by assuming that the powers of one stomach are to be made the rule in regulating every other the most unhealthful kinds of food are those which are made so by bad cooking such as sour and heavy bread cakes piecrust and other dishes consisting of fat mixed and cooked with flour also rancid butter and highseasoned food the fewer mixtures there are in cooking the more healthful is the food likely to be there is one caution as to the mode of eating which seems peculiarly needful to americans it is indispensable to good digestion that food be well chewed and taken slowly it needs to be thoroughly chewed in order to prepare it for the action of the gastric juice which by the peristaltic motion will be thus brought into universal contact with the minute portions it has been found that a solid lump of food requires much more time and labor of the stomach than divided substances it has also been found that as each bolus or mouthful enters the stomach the latter closes until the portion received has had some time to move around and combine with the gastric juice and that the orifice of the stomach resists the entrance of any more till this is accomplished but if the eater persists in swallowing fast the stomach yields the food is then poured in more rapidly than the organ can perform its duty of digestion and evil results are sooner or later developed this exhibits the folly of those hasty meals so common to travellers and to men of business and shows why children should be taught to eat slowly after taking a full meal it is very important to health that no great bodily or mental exertion be made till the labor of the stomach is over intense mental effort draws the blood to the head and muscular exertions draw it to the muscles and in consequence of this the stomach loses the supply which it requires when performing its office when the blood is thus withdrawn the adequate supply of gastric juice is not afforded and indigestion is the result the heaviness which follows a full meal is the indication which nature gives of the need of quiet when the meal is moderate a sufficient quantity of gastric juice is exuded in an hour or an hour and a half after which labor of body and mind may safely be resumed when undigested food remains in the stomach and is at last thrown out into the bowels it proves an irritating substance producing an inflamed state in the lining of the stomach and other organs the same effect is produced by alcoholic drinks it is found that the stomach has the power of gradually accommodating its digestive powers to the food it habitually receives thus animals which live on vegetables can gradually become accustomed to animal food and the reverse is equally true thus too the human stomach can eventually accomplish the digestion of some kinds of food which at first were indigestible but any changes of this sort should be gradual as those which are sudden are trying to the powers of the stomach by furnishing matter for which its gastric juice is not prepared in regard to the nature of the meals prepared the breakfast should furnish a supply of liquids because the body has been exhausted by the exhalations of the night and demands them more than at any other period it should not be the heartiest meal because the organs of digestion are weakened by long fasting and the exhalations dinner should be the heartiest meal because then the powers of digestion are strengthened by the supplies of the morning meal light and amusing employments should occupy mind and body for an hour or more after a full meal but little drink should be taken while eating as it dilutes the gastric juice which is apportioned to each quantity of food as it enters the stomach it is better to take drink after the meal is past extremes of heat or cold are injurious to the process of digestion taking hot food or drink habitually tends to debilitate all the organs thus needlessly excited in using cold substances it is found that a certain degree of warmth in the stomach is indispensable to their digestion so that when the gastric juice is cooled below this temperature it ceases to act indulging in large quantities of cold drinks or eating icecreams after a meal tends to reduce the temperature of the stomach and thus to stop digestion this shows the folly of those refreshments in convivial meetings where the guests are tempted to load the stomach with a variety such as would require the stomach of a stout farmer to digest and then to wind up with icecreams thus destroying whatever ability might otherwise have existed to digest the heavy load the fittest temperature for drinks if taken when the food is in the digesting process is blood heat cool drinks and even ice can be safely taken at other times if not in excessive quantity when the thirst is excessive or the body weakened by fatigue or when in a state of perspiration cold drinks are injurious when the body is perspiring freely taking a large quantity of cold drink has often produced instant death fluids taken into the stomach are not subject to the slow process of digestion but are immediately absorbed and carried into the blood this is the reason why drink more speedily than food restores from exhaustion the minute vessels of the stomach inhale or absorb its fluids which are carried into the blood just as the minute extremities of the arteries open upon the inner surface of the stomach and there exude the gastric juice from the blood when food is chiefly liquid soup for example the fluid part is rapidly absorbed the solid parts remain to be acted on by the gastric juice in the case of st martinf in fifty minutes after taking soup the fluids were absorbed and the remainder was even thicker than is usual after eating solid food this is the reason why soups are deemed bad for weak stomachs as this residuum is more difficult of digestion than ordinary food in recovering from sickness beeftea and broths are good because the system then demands fluids to supply its loss of blood highlyconcentrated food having much nourishment in a small bulk is not favorable to digestion because it cannot be properly acted on by the muscular contractions of the stomach and is not so minutely divided as to enable the gastric juice to act properly this is the reason why a certain bulk of food is needful to good digestion and why those people who live on whale oil and other highlynourishing food in cold climates mix vegetables and even sawdust with it to make it more acceptable and digestible so in civilized lands bread potatoes and vegetables are mixed with more highlyconcentrated nourishment this explains why coarse bread of unbolted wheat so often proves beneficial where from inactive habits or other causes the bowels become constipated and sluggish this kind of food proves the appropriate remedy one fact on this subject is worthy of notice under the administration of william pitt for two years or more there was such a scarcity of wheat that to make it hold out longer parliament passed a law that the army should have all their bread made of unbolted flour the result was that the health of the soldiers improved so much as to be a subject of surprise to themselves the officers and the physicians these last came out publicly and declared that the soldiers never before were so robust and healthy and that disease had nearly disappeared from the army the civic physicians joined and pronounced it the healthiest bread and for a time schools families and public institutions used it almost exclusively even the nobility convinced by these facts adopted it for their common diet and the fashion continued a long time after the scarcity ceased until more luxurious habits resumed their sway for this reason also soups gellies and arrowroot should have bread or crackers mixed with them we thus see why children should not have cakes and candies allowed them between meals these are highlyconcentrated nourishments and should be eaten with more bulky and less nourishing substances the most indigestible of all kinds of food are fatty and oily substances especially if heated it is on this account that piecrust and articles boiled and fried in fat or butter are deemed not so healthful as other food the following then may be put down as the causes of a debilitated constitution from the misuse of food eating too much eating too often eating too fast eating food and condiments that are too stimulating eating food that is too warm or too cold eating food that is highlyconcentrated without a proper admixture of less nourishing matter and eating food that is difficult of digestion footnote f the individual here referred toalexis st martinwas a young canadian of eighteen years of age of a good constitution and robust health who in 1822 was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a musket which carried away a part of the ribs lacerated one of the lobes of the lungs and perforated the stomach making a large aperture which never closed and which enabled dr beaumont a surgeon of the american army stationed at michilimackinac under whose care the patient was placed to witness all the processes of digestion and other functions of the body for several years the published account of the experiments made by dr b is highly interesting and instructive chapter vii on healthful drinks although intemperance in eating is probably the most prolific cause of the diseases of mankind intemperance in drink has produced more guilt misery and crime than any other one cause and the responsibilities of a woman in this particular are very great for the habits and liabilities of those under her care will very much depend on her opinions and practice it is a point fully established by experience that the full developement of the human body and the vigorous exercise of all its functions can be secured without the use of stimulating drinks it is therefore perfectly safe to bring up children never to use them no hazard being incurred by such a course it is also found by experience that there are two evils incurred by the use of stimulating drinks the first is their positive effect on the human system their peculiarity consists in so exciting the nervous system that all the functions of the body are accelerated and the fluids are caused to move quicker than at their natural speed this increased motion of the animal fluids always produces an agreeable effect on the mind the intellect is invigorated the imagination is excited the spirits are enlivened and these effects are so agreeable that all mankind after having once experienced them feel a great desire for their repetition but this temporary invigoration of the system is always followed by a diminution of the powers of the stimulated organs so that though in all cases this reaction may not be perceptible it is invariably the result it may be set down as the unchangeable rule of physiology that stimulating drinks except in cases of disease deduct from the powers of the constitution in exactly the proportion in which they operate to produce temporary invigoration the second evil is the temptation which always attends the use of stimulants their effect on the system is so agreeable and the evils resulting are so imperceptible and distant that there is a constant tendency to increase such excitement both in frequency and power and the more the system is thus reduced in strength the more craving is the desire for that which imparts a temporary invigoration this process of increasing debility and increasing craving for the stimulus that removes it often goes to such an extreme that the passion is perfectly uncontrollable and mind and body perish under this baleful habit in this country there are five forms in which the use of such stimulants is common namely alcoholic drinks tea coffee opium mixtures and tobacco these are all alike in the main peculiarity of imparting that extra stimulus to the system which tends to exhaust its powers multitudes in this nation are in the habitual use of some one of these stimulants and each person defends the indulgence by these arguments first that the desire for stimulants is a natural propensity implanted in mans nature as is manifest from the universal tendency to such indulgences in every nation from this it is inferred that it is an innocent desire which ought to be gratified to some extent and that the aim should be to keep it within the limits of temperance instead of attempting to exterminate a natural propensity this is an argument which if true makes it equally proper to use opium brandy tea or tobacco as stimulating principles provided they are used temperately but if it be granted that perfect health and strength can be gained and secured without these stimulants and that their peculiar effect is to diminish the power of the system in exactly the same proportion as they stimulate it then there is no such thing as a temperate use unless they are so diluted as to destroy any stimulating power and in this form they are seldom desired the other argument for their use is that they are among the good things provided by the creator for our gratification that like all other blessings they are exposed to abuse and excess and that we should rather seek to regulate their use than to banish them entirely this argument is based on the assumption that they are like healthful foods and drinks necessary to life and health and injurious only by excess but this is not true for whenever they are used in any such strength as to be a gratification they operate to a greater or less extent as stimulants and to just such extent they wear out the powers of the constitution and it is abundantly proved that they are not like food and drink necessary to health such articles are designed for medicine and not for common use there can be no argument framed to defend the use of one of them which will not equally defend all that men have a love for being stimulated after they have once felt the pleasurable excitement and that providence has provided the means for securing it are arguments as much in favor of alcohol opium and tobacco as of coffee and tea all that can be said in favor of the lastmentioned favorite beverages is that the danger in their use is not so great let any one who defends one kind of stimulating drink remember then that he uses an argument which if it be allowed that stimulants are not needed and are injurious will equally defend all kinds and that all which can be said in defence of tea and coffee is that they may be used so weak as to do no harm and that they actually have done less harm than some of the other stimulating narcotics the writer is of opinion that tea and coffee are a most extensive cause of much of the nervous debility and suffering endured by american women and that relinquishing such drinks would save an immense amount of such suffering but there is little probability that the present generation will make so decided a change in their habits as to give up these beverages and the subject is presented rather in reference to forming the habits of children it is a fact that tea and coffee are at first seldom or never agreeable to children it is the mixture of milk sugar and water that reconciles them to a taste which in this manner gradually becomes agreeable now suppose that those who provide for a family conclude that it is not their duty to give up entirely the use of stimulating drinks may not the case appear different in regard to teaching their children to love such drinks let the matter be regarded thusthe experiments of physiologists all prove that stimulants are not needful to health and that as the general rule they tend to debilitate the constitution is it right then for a parent to tempt a child to drink what is not needful when there is a probability that it will prove to some extent an undermining drain on the constitution some constitutions can bear much less excitement than others and in every family of children there is usually one or more of delicate organization and consequently peculiarly exposed to dangers from this source it is this child who ordinarily becomes the victim to stimulating drinks the tea and coffee which the parents and the healthier children can use without immediate injury gradually sap the energies of the feebler child who proves either an early victim or a living martyr to all the sufferings that debilitated nerves inflict can it be right to lead children where all allow that there is some danger and where in many cases disease and death are met when another path is known to be perfectly safe of the stimulating drinks in common use black tea is least injurious because its flavor is so strong in comparison with its narcotic principle that one who uses it is much less liable to excess children can be trained to love milk and water sweetened with sugar so that it will always be a pleasant beverage or if there are exceptions to the rule they will be few water is an unfailing resort every one loves it and it is perfectly healthful the impression common in this country that warm drinks especially in winter are more healthful than cold is not warranted by any experience nor by the laws of the physical system at dinner cold drinks are universal and no one deems them injurious it is only at the other two meals that they are supposed to be hurtful there is no doubt that warm drinks are healthful and more agreeable than cold at certain times and seasons but it is equally true that drinks above blood heat are not healthful if any person should hold a finger in hot water for a considerable time twice every day it would be found that the finger would gradually grow weaker the frequent application of the stimulus of heat like all other stimulants eventually causes debility if therefore a person is in the habit of drinking hot drinks twice a day the teeth throat and stomach are gradually debilitated this most probably is one of the causes of an early decay of the teeth which is observed to be much more common among american ladies than among those in european countries it has been stated to the writer by an intelligent traveller who had visited mexico that it was rare to meet an individual with even a tolerable set of teeth and that almost every grown person he met in the street had merely remnants of teeth on inquiry into the customs of the country it was found that it was the universal practice to take their usual beverage at almost the boiling point and this doubtless was the chief cause of the almost entire want of teeth in that country in the united states it cannot be doubted that much evil is done in this way by hot drinks most teadrinkers consider tea as ruined if it stands until it reaches the healthful temperature for drink the following extract from dr andrew combe presents the opinion of most intelligent medical men on this subjectg water is a safe drink for all constitutions provided it be resorted to in obedience to the dictates of natural thirst only and not of habit unless the desire for it is felt there is no occasion for its use during a meal the primary effect of all distilled and fermented liquors is to stimulate the nervous system and quicken the circulation in infancy and childhood the circulation is rapid and easily excited and the nervous system is strongly acted upon even by the slightest external impressions hence slight causes of irritation readily excite febrile and convulsive disorders in youth the natural tendency of the constitution is still to excitement and consequently as a general rule the stimulus of fermented liquors is injurious these remarks show that parents who find that stimulating drinks are not injurious to themselves may mistake in inferring from this that they will not be injurious to their children dr combe continues thus in mature age when digestion is good and the system in full vigor if the mode of life be not too exhausting the nervous functions and general circulation are in their best condition and require no stimulus for their support the bodily energy is then easily sustained by nutritious food and a regular regimen and consequently artificial excitement only increases the wasting of the natural strength in old age when the powers of life begin to fail moderate stimulus may be used with evident advantage it may be asked in this connection why the stimulus of animal food is not to be regarded in the same light as that of stimulating drinks in reply a very essential difference may be pointed out animal food furnishes nutriment to the organs which it stimulates but stimulating drinks excite the organs to quickened action without affording any nourishment it has been supposed by some that tea and coffee have at least a degree of nourishing power but it is proved that it is the milk and sugar and not the main portion of the drink which imparts the nourishment tea has not one particle of nourishing properties and what little exists in the coffeeberry is lost by roasting it in the usual mode all that these articles do is simply to stimulate without nourishing it is very common especially in schools for children to form a habit of drinking freely of cold water this is a debilitating habit and should be corrected very often chewing a bit of cracker will stop a craving for drink better than taking water and when teachers are troubled with very thirsty scholars they should direct them to this remedy a person who exercises but little requires no drink between meals for health and the craving for it is unhealthful spices wines fermented liquors and all stimulating condiments produce unhealthful thirst footnote g the writer would here remark in reference to extracts made from various authors that for the sake of abridging she has often left out parts of a paragraph but never so as to modify the meaning of the author some ideas not connected with the subject in hand are omitted but none are altered chapter viii on clothing it appears by calculations made from bills of mortality that one quarter of the human race perishes in infancy this is a fact not in accordance with the analogy of nature no such mortality prevails among the young of animals it does not appear to be the design of the creator and it must be owing to causes which can be removed medical men agree in the opinion that a great portion of this mortality is owing to mismanagement in reference to fresh air food and clothing at birth the circulation is chiefly in the vessels of the skin for the liver and stomach being feeble in action demand less blood and it resorts to the surface if therefore an infant be exposed to cold the blood is driven inward by the contracting of the bloodvessels in the skin and the internal organs being thus overstimulated bowel complaints croup convulsions or some other evil ensues this shows the sad mistake of parents who plunge infants in cold water to strengthen their constitution and teaches that infants should be washed in warm water and in a warm room some have constitutions strong enough to bear mismanagement in these respects but many fail in consequence of it hence we see the importance of dressing infants warmly and protecting them from exposure to a cold temperature it is for this purpose that mothers now very generally cover the arms and necks of infants especially in winter fathers and mothers if they were obliged to go with bare arms and necks even in moderate weather would often shiver with cold and yet they have a power of constitution which would subject them to far less hazard and discomfort than a delicate infant must experience from a similar exposure this mode of dressing infants with bare necks and arms has arisen from the common impression that they have a power of resisting cold superior to older persons this is a mistake for the experiments of medical men have established the fact that the power of producing heat is least in the period of infancy extensive investigations have been made in france in reference to this point it is there required in some districts that every infant at birth be carried to the office of the maire mayor to be registered it is found in these districts that the deaths of newlyborn infants are much more numerous in the cold than in the warm months and that a much greater proportion of such deaths occurs among those who reside at a distance from the office of the maire than among those in its vicinity this proves that exposure to cold has much to do with the continuance of infant life but it is as dangerous to go to the other extreme and keep the body too warm the skin when kept at too high a temperature is relaxed and weakened by too profuse perspiration and becomes more sensitive and more readily affected by every change of temperature this increases the liabilities to sudden colds and it frequently happens that the children who are most carefully guarded from cold are the ones most liable to take sudden and dangerous chills the reason is that by the too great accumulation of clothing the skin is too much excited and the blood is withdrawn from the internal organs thus weakening them while the skin itself is debilitated by the same process the rule of safety is so to cover the body as to keep it entirely warm but not so as to induce perspiration in any part the perspiration induced by exercise is healthful because it increases the appetite but the perspiration produced by excess of clothing is debilitating this shows the importance of adjusting beds and their covering to the season featherbeds are unhealthful in warm weather because they induce perspiration and in all cases those who have the care of children should proportion their covering by night to the season of the year infants and children should never be so clothed as either to feel chilly or to induce perspiration the greatest trouble in this respect to those who have the care of children is owing to their throwing off their covering in the night the best guard against such exposures is a nightgown of the warmest and thickest flannel made like pantaloons at the lower part and the legs long so that they can be tied over the feet this makes less covering needful and saves the child from excessive cold when it is thrown off the clothing ought always to be proportioned to the constitution and habits a person of strong constitution who takes much exercise needs less clothing than one of delicate and sedentary habits according to this rule women need much thicker and warmer clothing when they go out than men but how different are our customs from what sound wisdom dictates women go out with thin stockings thin shoes and open necks when men are protected by thick woollen hose and boots and their whole body encased in many folds of flannel and broadcloth flannel worn next the skin is useful for several reasons it is a bad conductor of heat so that it protects the body from sudden chills when in a state of perspiration it also produces a kind of friction on the skin which aids it in its functions while its texture being loose enables it to receive and retain much matter thrown off from the body which would otherwise accumulate on its surface this is the reason why medical men direct that young children wear flannel next the body and woollen hose the first two years of life they are thus protected from sudden exposures for the same reason laboring men should thus wear flannels which are also considered as preservatives from infection in unhealthy atmospheres they give a healthy action to the skin and thus enable it to resist the operation of unhealthy miasms on this account persons residing in a new country should wear such clothing next the skin to guard them from the noxious miasms caused by extensive vegetable decompositions it is stated that the fatal influence of the malaria or noxious exhalations around rome has been much diminished by this practice but those who thus wear flannel through the day ought to take it off at night when it is not needed it should be hung so that it can be well aired during the night but the practice by which females probably suffer most is the use of tight dresses much has been said against the use of corsets by ladies but these may be worn with perfect safety and be left off and still injury such as they often produce be equally felt it is the constriction of dress that is to be feared and not any particular article that produces it a frock or a belt may be so tight as to be even worse than a corset which would more equally divide the compression so long as it is the fashion to admire as models of elegance the wasplike figures which are presented at the rooms of mantuamakers and milliners there will be hundreds of foolish women who will risk their lives and health to secure some resemblance to these deformities of the human frame but it is believed that all sensible women when they fairly understand the evils which result from tight dressing and learn the real model of taste and beauty for a perfect female form will never risk their own health or the health of their daughters in efforts to secure one which is as much at variance with good taste as it is with good health such female figures as our printshops present are made not by the hand of the author of all grace and beauty but by the murderous contrivances of the corsetshop and the more a woman learns the true rules of grace and beauty for the female form the more her taste will revolt from such ridiculous distortions the folly of the chinese belle who totters on two useless deformities is nothing compared to that of the american belle who impedes all the internal organs in the discharge of their functions that she may have a slender waist it was shown in the article on the bones and muscles that exercise was indispensable to their growth and strength if any muscles are left unemployed they diminish in size and strength the girding of tight dresses operates thus on the muscles of the body if an article like corsets is made to hold up the body then those muscles which are designed for this purpose are released from duty and grow weak so that after this has been continued for some time leaving off the unnatural support produces a feeling of weakness thus a person will complain of feeling so weak and unsupported without corsets as to be uncomfortable this is entirely owing to the disuse of those muscles which corsets throw out of employ another effect of tight dress is to stop or impede the office of the lungs unless the chest can expand fully and with perfect ease a portion of the lungs is not filled with air and thus the full purification of the blood is prevented this movement of the lungs when they are fully inflated increases the peristaltic movement of the stomach and bowels and promotes digestion any constriction of the waist tends to impede this important operation and indigestion with all its attendant evils is often the result the rule of safety in regard to the tightness of dress is this every person should be dressed so loosely that when sitting in the posture used in sewing reading or study the lungs can be as fully and as easily inflated as they are without clothing many a woman thinks she dresses loosely because when she stands up her clothing does not confine her chest this is not a fair test it is in the position most used when engaged in common employments that we are to judge of the constriction of dress let every woman then bear in mind that just so long as her dress and position oppose any resistance to the motion of her chest in just such proportion her blood is unpurified and her vital organs are debilitated the english ladies set our countrywomen a good example in accommodating their dress to times and seasons the richest and noblest among them wear warm cotton hose and thick shoes when they walk for exercise and would deem it vulgar to appear as many of our ladies do with thin hose and shoes in damp or cold weather any mode of dress not suited to the employment the age the season or the means of the wearer is in bad taste chapter ix on cleanliness the importance of cleanliness in person and dress can never be fully realized by persons who are ignorant of the construction of the skin and of the influence which its treatment has on the health of the body persons deficient in such knowledge frequently sneer at what they deem the foolish and fidgety particularity of others whose frequent ablutions and changes of clothing exceed their own measure of importance the popular maxim that dirt is healthy has probably arisen from the fact that playing in the open air is very beneficial to the health of children who thus get dirt on their persons and clothes but it is the fresh air and exercise and not the dirt which promotes the health in a previous article it was shown that the lungs bowels kidneys and skin were the organs employed in throwing off those waste and noxious parts of the food not employed in nourishing the body of this the skin has the largest duty to perform throwing off at least twenty ounces every twentyfour hours by means of insensible perspiration when exercise sets the blood in quicker motion it ministers its supplies faster and there is consequently a greater residuum to be thrown off by the skin and then the perspiration becomes so abundant as to be perceptible in this state if a sudden chill take place the bloodvessels of the skin contract the blood is driven from the surface and the internal organs are taxed with a double duty if the constitution be a strong one these organs march on and perform the labor exacted but if any of these organs be debilitated the weakest one generally gives way and some disease ensues one of the most frequent illustrations of this reciprocated action is afforded by a convivial meeting in cold weather the heat of the room the food and the excitement quicken the circulation and perspiration is evolved when the company passes into the cold air a sudden revulsion takes place the increased circulation continues for some time after but the skin being cooled the blood retreats and the internal organs are obliged to perform the duties of the skin as well as their own then in case the lungs are the weakest organ the mucous secretion becomes excessive so that it would fill up the cells and stop the breathing were it not for the spasmodic effort called coughing by which this substance is thrown out in case the nerves are the weakest part of the system such an exposure would result in pains in the head or teeth or in some other nervous ailment if the muscles be the weakest part rheumatic affections will ensue and if the bowels or kidneys be weakest some disorder in their functions will result but it is found that the closing of the pores of the skin with other substances tends to a similar result on the internal organs in this situation the skin is unable perfectly to perform its functions and either the blood remains to a certain extent unpurified or else the internal organs have an unnatural duty to perform either of these results tends to produce disease and the gradual decay of the vital powers moreover it has been shown that the skin has the power of absorbing into the blood particles retained on its surface in consequence of these peculiarities the skin of the whole body needs to be washed every day this process removes from the pores the matter exhaled from the blood and also that collected from the atmosphere and other bodies if this process be not often performed the pores of the skin fill up with the redundant matter expelled and being pressed by the clothing to the surface of the body the skin is both interrupted in its exhaling process and its absorbents take back into the system portions of the noxious matter thus the blood is not relieved to the extent designed while it receives back noxious particles which are thus carried to the lungs liver and every part of the system this is the reason why the articles worn next to the skin should often be changed and why it is recommended that persons should not sleep in the article they wear next the skin through the day the alternate change and airing of the articles worn next the body by day or night is a practice very favorable to the health of the skin the fresh air has the power of removing much of the noxious effluvia received from the body by the clothing it is with reference to this that on leaving a bed its covering should be thrown open and exposed to the fresh air the benefit arising from a proper care of the skin is the reason why bathing has been so extensively practised by civilized nations the greeks and romans considered bathing as indispensable to daily comfort as much so as their meals and public baths were provided for all classes in european countries this practice is very prevalent but there is no civilized nation which pays so little regard to the rules of health on this subject as our own to wash the face feet hands and neck is the extent of the ablutions practised by perhaps the majority of our people in regard to the use of the bath there is need of some information in order to prevent danger from its misuse persons in good health and with strong constitutions can use the cold bath and the showerbath with entire safety and benefit but if the constitution be feeble cold bathing is injurious if it is useful it can be known by an invigorated feeling and a warm glow on the skin but if instead of this there be a feeling of debility and the hands and feet become cold it is a certain sign that this kind of bathing is injurious a bath at ninetyfive degrees of fahrenheit is about the right temperature a bath blood warm or a little cooler than the skin is safe for all constitutions if not protracted over half an hour after bathing the body should be rubbed with a brush or coarse towel to remove the light scales of scarfskin which adhere to it and also to promote a healthful excitement a bath should never be taken till three hours after eating as it interrupts the process of digestion by withdrawing the blood from the stomach to the surface neither should it be taken when the body is weary with exercise nor be immediately followed by severe exercise many suppose that a warm bath exposes a person more readily to take cold and that it tends to debilitate the system this is not the case unless it be protracted too long if it be used so as to cleanse the skin and give it a gentle stimulus it is better able to resist cold than before the process this is the reason why the swedes and russians can rush reeking out of their steam baths and throw themselves into the snow and not only escape injury but feel invigorated it is for a similar reason that we suffer less in going into the cold from a warm room with our body entirely warm than when we go out somewhat chilled when the skin is warm the circulation is active on the surface and the cold does not so reduce its temperature but that increased exercise will keep up its warmth when families have no bathing establishment every member should wash the whole person on rising or going to bed either in cold or warm water according to the constitution it is especially important that children have the perspiration and other impurities which their exercise and sports have occasioned removed from their skin before going to bed the hours of sleep are those when the body most freely exhales the waste matter of the system and all the pores should be properly freed from impediments to this healthful operation for this purpose a large tin washpan should be kept for children just large enough at bottom for them to stand in and flaring outward so as to be very broad at top a child can then be placed in it standing and washed with a sponge without wetting the floor being small at bottom it is better than a tub it is not only smaller but lighter and requires less water these remarks indicate the wisdom of those parents who habitually wash their children all over before they go to bed the chance of life and health to such children is greatly increased by this practice and no doubt much of the suffering of childhood from cutaneous eruptions weak eyes earache colds and fevers is owing to a neglect of the skin the care of the teeth should be made habitual to children not merely as promoting an agreeable appearance but as a needful preservative the saliva contains tartar an earthy substance which is deposited on the teeth and destroys both their beauty and health this can be prevented by the use of the brush night and morning but if this be neglected the deposite becomes hard and can be removed only by the dentist if suffered to remain it tends to destroy the health of the gums they gradually decay and thus the roots of the teeth become bare and they often drop out when children are shedding their first set of teeth care should be taken to remove them as soon as they become loose otherwise the new teeth will grow awry when persons have defective teeth they can often be saved by having them filled by a dentist this also will frequently prevent the toothache children should be taught to take proper care of their nails long and dirty nails have a disagreeable appearance when children wash in the morning they should be supplied with an instrument to clean the nails and be required to use it chapter x on early rising there is no practice which has been more extensively eulogized in all ages than early rising and this universal impression is an indication that it is founded on true philosophy for it is rarely the case that the common sense of mankind fastens on a practice as really beneficial especially one that demands selfdenial without some substantial reason this practice which may justly be called a domestic virtue is one which has a peculiar claim to be styled american and democratic the distinctive mark of aristocratic nations is a disregard of the great mass and a disproportionate regard for the interests of certain privileged orders all the customs and habits of such a nation are to a greater or less extent regulated by this principle now the mass of any nation must always consist of persons who labor at occupations which demand the light of day but in aristocratic countries especially in england labor is regarded as the mark of the lower classes and indolence is considered as one mark of a gentleman this impression has gradually and imperceptibly to a great extent regulated their customs so that even in their hours of meals and repose the higher orders aim at being different and distinct from those who by laborious pursuits are placed below them from this circumstance while the lower orders labor by day and sleep at night the rich the noble and the honored sleep by day and follow their pursuits and pleasures by night it will be found that the aristocracy of london breakfast near midday dine after dark visit and go to parliament between ten and twelve at night and retire to sleep towards morning in consequence of this the subordinate classes who aim at gentility gradually fall into the same practice the influence of this custom extends across the ocean and here in this democratic land we find many who measure their grade of gentility by the late hour at which they arrive at a party and this aristocratic tendency is growing upon us so that throughout the nation the hours for visiting and retiring are constantly becoming later while the hours for rising correspond in lateness the question then is one which appeals to american women as a matter of patriotism as having a bearing on those great principles of democracy which we conceive to be equally the principles of christianity shall we form our customs on the principle that labor is degrading and indolence genteel shall we assume by our practice that the interests of the great mass are to be sacrificed for the pleasures and honors of a privileged few shall we ape the customs of aristocratic lands in those very practices which result from principles and institutions that we condemn shall we not rather take the place to which we are entitled as the leaders rather than the followers in the customs of society turn back the tide of aristocratic inroads and carry through the whole not only of civil and political but of social and domestic life the true principles of democratic freedom and equality the following considerations may serve to strengthen an affirmative decision the first relates to the health of a family it is a universal law of physiology that all living things flourish best in the light vegetables in a dark cellar grow pale and spindlingh and children brought up in mines are wan and stinted this universal law indicates the folly of turning day into night thus losing the genial influence which the light of day produces on all animated creation there is another phenomenon in the physiology of nature which equally condemns this practice it has been shown that the purification of the blood in the lungs is secured by the oxygen of the atmosphere absorbing its carbon and hydrogen this combination forms carbonic acid and water which are expired from our lungs into the atmosphere now all the vegetable world undergoes a similar process in the light of day all the leaves of vegetables absorb carbon and expire oxygen thus supplying the air with its vital principle and withdrawing the more deleterious element but when the light is withdrawn this process is reversed and all vegetables exhale carbonic acid and inspire the oxygen of the air thus it appears that the atmosphere of day is much more healthful than that of the night especially out of doors moreover when the body is fatigued it is much more liable to deleterious influences from noxious particles in the atmosphere which may be absorbed by the skin or the lungs in consequence of this the last hours of daily labor are more likely to be those of risk especially to delicate constitutions this is a proper reason for retiring to the house and to slumber at an early hour that the body may not be exposed to the most risk when after the exertions of the day it is least able to bear it the observations of medical men whose inquiries have been directed to this point have decided that from six to eight hours is the amount of sleep demanded by persons in health some constitutions require as much as eight and others no more than six hours of repose but eight hours is the maximum for all persons in ordinary health with ordinary occupations in cases of extra physical exertions or the debility of disease or a decayed constitution more than this is required let eight hours then be regarded as the ordinary period required for sleep by an industrious people like the americans according to this the practice of rising between four and five and retiring between nine and ten in summer would secure most of the sunlight and expose us the least to that period of the atmosphere when it is most noxious in winter the night air is less deleterious because the frost binds noxious exhalations and vegetation ceases its inspiring and expiring process and moreover as the constitution is more tried in cold than in warm weather and as in cold weather the body exhales less during the hours of sleep it is not so injurious to protract our slumbers beyond the proper period as it is in the warm months but in winter it is best for grown persons in health to rise as soon as they can see to dress and retire so as not to allow more than eight hours for sleep it thus appears that the laws of our political condition the laws of the natural world and the constitution of our bodies alike demand that we rise with the light of day to prosecute our employments and that we retire within doors when this light is withdrawn in regard to the effects of protracting the time spent in repose many extensive and satisfactory investigations have been made it has been shown that during sleep the body perspires most freely while yet neither food nor exercise are ministering to its wants of course if we continue our slumbers beyond the time required to restore the body to its usual vigor there is an unperceived undermining of the constitution by this protracted and debilitating exhalation this process in a course of years renders the body delicate and less able to withstand disease and in the result shortens life sir john sinclair who has written a large work on the causes of longevity states as one result of his extensive investigations that he has never yet heard or read of a single case of great longevity where the individual was not an early riser he says that he has found cases in which the individual has violated some one of all the other laws of health and yet lived to great age but never a single instance in which any constitution has withstood that undermining consequent on protracting the hours of repose beyond the demands of the system another reason for early rising is that it is indispensable to a systematic and wellregulated family at whatever hour the parents retire children and domestics wearied by play or labor must retire early children usually awake with the dawn of light and commence their play while domestics usually prefer the freshness of morning for their labors if then the parents rise at a late hour they either induce a habit of protracting sleep in their children and domestics or else the family is up and at their pursuits while their supervisors are in bed any woman who asserts that her children and domestics in the first hours of day when their spirits are freshest will be as well regulated without her presence as with it confesses that which surely is little for her credit it is believed that any candid woman whatever may be her excuse for late rising will concede that if she could rise early it would be for the advantage of her family a late breakfast puts back the work through the whole day for every member of a family and if the parents thus occasion the loss of an hour or two to each individual who but for their delay in the morning would be usefully employed they alone are responsible for all this waste of time is it said that those who wish to rise early can go to their employments before breakfast it may be replied that in most cases it is not safe to use the eyes or the muscles in the morning till the losses of the night have been repaired by food in addition to this it may be urged that where the parents set an example of the violation of the rules of health and industry their influence tends in the wrong direction so that whatever waste of time is induced by a practice which they thus uphold must be set down to their account but the practice of early rising has a relation to the general interests of the social community as well as to that of each distinct family all that great portion of the community who are employed in business and labor find it needful to rise early and all their hours of meals and their appointments for business or pleasure must be accommodated to these arrangements now if a small portion of the community establish very different hours it makes a kind of jostling in all the concerns and interests of society the various appointments for the public such as meetings schools and business hours must be accommodated to the mass and not to individuals the few then who establish domestic habits at variance with the majority are either constantly interrupted in their own arrangements or else are interfering with the rights and interests of others this is exemplified in the case of schools in families where late rising is practised either hurry irregularity and neglect are engendered in the family or else the interests of the school and thus of the community are sacrificed in this and many other concerns it can be shown that the wellbeing of the bulk of the people is to a greater or less extent impaired by this aristocratic practice let any teacher select the unpunctual scholarsa class who most seriously interfere with the interests of the schooland let men of business select those who cause them most waste of time and vexation by unpunctuality and it will be found that they are among the late risers and rarely among those who rise early thus it is manifest that late rising not only injures the person and family which practise it but interferes with the rights and convenience of the community footnote h shooting into a long small stalk or root chapter xi on domestic exercise in the preceding chapters we have noticed the various causes which one or all operate to produce that melancholy delicacy and decay of the female constitution which are the occasion of so much physical and mental suffering throughout this country these in a more condensed form may be enumerated thus a want of exercise inducing softness in the bones weakness in the muscles inactivity in the digestive organs and general debility in the nervous system a neglect of the care of the skin whereby the blood has not been properly purified and the internal organs have been weakened a violation of the laws of health in regard to food by eating too much too fast and too often by using stimulating food and drinks by using them too warm or too cold and by eating that which the power of the stomach is not sufficient to digest a neglect of the laws of health in regard to clothing by dressing too tight and by wearing too little covering in cold and damp weather and especially by not sufficiently protecting the feet a neglect to gain a proper supply of pure air in sleeping apartments and schoolrooms and too great a confinement to the house the pursuit of exciting amusements at unseasonable hours and the many exposures involved at such times and lastly sleeping by day instead of by night and protracting the hours of sleep beyond the period of repose demanded for rest thus exhausting instead of recruiting the energies of the system but all the other causes combined probably do not produce one half the evils which result from a want of proper exercise a person who keeps all the functions of the system in full play by the active and frequent use of every muscle especially if it be in the open air gains a power of constitution which can resist many evils that would follow from the other neglects and risks detailed this being the case there can be no subject more important for mothers and young ladies to understand than the influence on the health both of body and mind of the neglect or abuse of the muscular system it has been shown in the previous pages that all the muscles have nerves and bloodvessels running in larger trunks or minute branches to every portion of the body the experiments of sir charles bell and others have developed the curious fact that each apparently single nerve in reality consists of two distinct portions running together in the same covering one portion is the nerve of sensation or feeling the other the nerve of motion the nerves of sensation are those which are affected by the emotions and volitions of the mind and the nerves of motion are those which impart moving power to the muscles experiments show that where the nerves issue from the spine the nerve of sensation may be cut off without severing the nerve of motion and then the parts to which this nerve extends lose the power of feeling while the power of motion continues and so on the other hand the nerve of motion may be divided and the nerve of sensation remaining uninjured the power of feeling is retained and the power of motion is lost in certain nervous diseases sometimes a limb loses its power of feeling and yet retains the power of motion in other cases the power of motion is lost and the power of sensation is retained and in other cases still when a limb is paralysed both the power of motion and of sensation are lost now the nerves like all other parts of the body gain and lose strength according as they are exercised if they have too much or too little exercise they lose strength if they are exercised to a proper degree they gain strength when the mind is continuously excited by business study or the imagination the nerves of feeling are kept in constant action while the nerves of motion are unemployed if this is continued for a long time the nerves of sensation lose their strength from over action and the nerves of motion lose their power from inactivity in consequence there is a morbid excitability of the nervous and a debility of the muscular system which make all exertion irksome and wearisome the only mode of preserving the health of these systems is to keep up in them an equilibrium of action for this purpose occupations must be sought which exercise the muscles and interest the mind and thus the equal action of both kinds of nerves is secured this shows why exercise is so much more healthful and invigorating when the mind is interested than when it is not as an illustration let a person go a shopping with a friend and have nothing to do but look on how soon do the continuous walking and standing weary but suppose one thus wearied hears of the arrival of a very dear friend she can instantly walk off a mile or two to meet her without the least feeling of fatigue by this is shown the importance of furnishing for young persons exercise in which they will take an interest long and formal walks merely for exercise though they do some good in securing fresh air and some exercise of the muscles would be of triple benefit if changed to amusing sports or to the cultivation of fruits and flowers in which it is impossible to engage without acquiring a great interest it shows also why it is far better to trust to useful domestic exercise at home than to send a young person out to walk for the mere purpose of exercise young girls can seldom be made to realize the value of health and the need of exercise to secure it so as to feel much interest in walking abroad when they have no other object but if they are brought up to minister to the comfort and enjoyment of themselves and others by performing domestic duties they will constantly be interested and cheered in their exercise by the feeling of usefulness and the consciousness of having performed their duty there are few young persons it is hoped who are brought up with such miserable habits of selfishness and indolence that they cannot be made to feel happier by the consciousness of being usefully employed and those who have never been accustomed to think or care for any one but themselves and who seem to feel little pleasure in making themselves useful by wise and proper influences can often be gradually awakened to the new pleasure of benevolent exertion to promote the comfort and enjoyment of others and the more this sacred and elevating kind of enjoyment is tasted the greater is the relish induced other enjoyments often cloy but the heavenly pleasure secured by virtuous industry and benevolence while it satisfies at the time awakens fresh desires for so ennobling a good but besides the favorable influence on the nervous and muscular system thus gained it has been shown that exercise imparts fresh strength and vitality to all parts of the body the exertion of the muscles quickens the flow of the blood which thus ministers its supplies faster to every part of the body and of course loses a portion of its nourishing qualities when this is the case the stomach issues its mandate of hunger calling for new supplies when these are furnished the action of the muscles again hastens a full supply to every organ and thus the nerves the muscles the bones the skin and all the internal organs are invigorated and the whole body developes its powers in fair proportions fresh strength and full beauty all the cosmetics of trade all the labors of mantuamakers milliners makers of corsets shoemakers and hairdressers could never confer so clear and pure a skin so fresh a color so finely moulded a form and such cheerful health and spirits as would be secured by training a child to obey the laws of the benevolent creator in the appropriate employment of body and mind in useful domestic exercise and the present habits of the wealthy and even of those without wealth which condemn young girls so exclusively to books or sedentary pursuits are as destructive to beauty and grace as they are to health and happiness every allowance should be made for the mistakes of mothers and teachers to whom the knowledge which would have saved them from the evils of such a course has never been furnished but as information on these matters is every year becoming more abundant it is to be hoped that the next generation at least may be saved from the evils which afflict those now on the stage what a change would be made in the happiness of this country if all the pale and delicate young girls should become blooming healthful and active and all the enfeebled and careworn mothers should be transformed into such fresh active healthful and energetic matrons as are so frequently found in our mother land it has been stated that the excessive use of the muscles as much as their inactivity tends to weaken them nothing is more painful than the keeping a muscle constantly on the stretch without any relaxation or change this can be realized by holding out an arm perpendicularly to the body for ten or fifteen minutes if any one can so long bear the pain of course confinement to one position for a great length of time tends to weaken the muscles thus strained this shows the evil of confining young children to their seats in the schoolroom so much and so long as is often done having no backs to their seats as is generally the case the muscles which are employed in holding up the body are kept in a state of constant tension till they grow feeble from overworking then the child begins to grow crooked and the parents to remedy the evil sometimes put on bracers or corsets these instead of doing any good serve to prevent the use of those muscles which if properly exercised would hold the body straight and thus they grow still weaker from entire inactivity if a parent perceives that a child is growing crooked the proper remedy is to withdraw it from all pursuits which tax one particular set of muscles and turn it out to exercise in sports or in gardening in the fresh air when all the muscles will be used and the whole system strengthened or if this cannot be done sweeping dusting running of errands and many household employments which involve lifting stooping bending and walking are quite as good and on some accounts better provided the house is properly supplied with fresh air where persons have formed habits of inactivity some caution is necessary in attempting a change this must be made gradually and the muscles must never be excessively fatigued at any time if this change be not thus gradually made the weakness at first caused by inactivity will be increased by excessive exertion a distinguished medical gentleman gives this rule to direct us in regard to the amount of fatigue which is safe and useful a person is never too much fatigued if one night of repose gives sufficient rest and restores the usual strength but if the sleep is disturbed and the person wakes with a feeling of weariness and languor it is a sure indication that the exercise has been excessive no more fatigue then should be allowed than one nights rest will remedy some persons object to sweeping on account of the dust inhaled but free ventilation frequent sweeping and the use of damp sand or damp indian meal or damp tea leaves for carpets will secure a more clear atmosphere than is often found in the streets of cities and the mother who will hire domestics to take away this and other domestic employments which would secure to her daughters health grace beauty and domestic virtues and the young ladies who consent to be deprived of these advantages will probably live to mourn over the languor discouragement pain and sorrow which will come with ill health as the almost inevitable result the following are extracts from the young ladies friend on this subject whether rich or poor young or old married or single a woman is always liable to be called to the performance of every kind of domestic duty as well as to be placed at the head of a family and nothing short of a practical knowledge of the details of housekeeping can ever make those duties easy or render her competent to direct others in the performance of them all moral writers on female character treat of domestic economy as an indispensable part of female education and this too in the old countries of europe where an abundant population and the institutions of society render it easy to secure the services of faithful domestics all female characters that are held up to admiration whether in fiction or biography will be found to possess these domestic accomplishments and if they are considered indispensable in the old world how much more are they needed in this land of independence where riches cannot exempt the mistress of a family from the difficulty of procuring efficient aid and where perpetual change of domestics renders perpetual instruction and superintendence necessary since then the details of good housekeeping must be included in a good female education it is very desirable that they should be acquired when young and so practised as to become easy and to be performed dexterously and expeditiously the elegant and accomplished lady mary wortley montagu who figured in the fashionable as well as the literary circles of her time has said that the most minute details of household economy become elegant and refined when they are ennobled by sentiment and they are truly ennobled when we do them either from a sense of duty or consideration for a parent or love to a husband to furnish a room continues this lady is no longer a commonplace affair shared with upholsterers and cabinetmakers it is decorating the place where i am to meet a friend or lover to order dinner is not merely arranging a meal with my cook it is preparing refreshment for him whom i love these necessary occupations viewed in this light by a person capable of strong attachment are so many pleasures and afford her far more delight than the games and shows which constitute the amusements of the world such is the testimony of a titled lady of the last century to the sentiment that may be made to mingle in the most homely occupations i will now quote that of a modern female writer and traveller who in her pleasant book called six weeks on the loire has thus described the housewifery of the daughter of a french nobleman residing in a superb chateau on that river the travellers had just arrived and been introduced when the following scene took place the bill of fare for dinner was discussed in my presence and settled sans faoni with that delightful frankness and gayety which in the french character gives a charm to the most trifling occurrence mademoiselle louise then begged me to excuse her for half an hour as she was going to make some creams and some pastillesj i requested that i might accompany her and also render myself useful we accordingly went together to the dairy i made tarts langlaisek whilst she made confections and bonbonsl and all manner of pretty things with as much ease as if she had never done any thing else and as much grace as she displayed in the saloon i could not help thinking as i looked at her with her servants about her all cheerful respectful and anxious to attend upon her how much better it would be for the young ladies in england if they would occasionally return to the habits of their grandmammas and mingle the animated and endearing occupations of domestic life and the modest manners and social amusements of home with the perpetual practising on harps and pianos and the incessant efforts at display and search after gayety which at the present day render them any thing but what an amiable man of a reflecting mind and delicate sentiments would desire in the woman he might wish to select as the companion of his life footnotes i without formality or useless ceremony j rolls of paste or pastry or sugarplums k according to the english fashion l nice things or dainties such as sweetmeats chapter xii on domestic manners goodmanners are the expressions of benevolence in personal intercourse by which we endeavor to promote the comfort and enjoyment of others and to avoid all that gives needless uneasiness it is the exterior exhibition of the divine precept which requires us to do to others as we would that they should do to us it is saying by our deportment to all around that we consider their feelings tastes and convenience as equal in value to our own goodmanners lead us to avoid all practices which offend the taste of others all violations of the conventional rules of propriety all rude and disrespectful language and deportment and all remarks which would tend to wound the feelings of another there is a serious defect in the manners of the american people especially in the free states which can never be efficiently remedied except in the domestic circle and during early life it is a deficiency in the free expression of kindly feelings and sympathetic emotions and a want of courtesy in deportment the causes which have led to this result may easily be traced the forefathers of this nation to a wide extent were men who were driven from their native land by laws and customs which they believed to be opposed both to civil and religious freedom the sufferings they were called to endure the subduing of those gentler feelings which bind us to country kindred and home and the constant subordination of the passions to stern principle induced characters of great firmness and selfcontrol they gave up the comforts and refinements of a civilized country and came as pilgrims to a hard soil a cold clime and a heathen shore they were continually forced to encounter danger privations sickness loneliness and death and all these their religion taught them to meet with calmness fortitude and submission and thus it became the custom and habit of the whole mass to repress rather than to encourage the expression of feeling persons who are called to constant and protracted suffering and privation are forced to subdue and conceal emotion for the free expression of it would double their own suffering and increase the sufferings of others those only who are free from care and anxiety and whose minds are mainly occupied by cheerful emotions are at full liberty to unveil their feelings it was under such stern and rigorous discipline that the first children in new england were reared and the manners and habits of parents are usually to a great extent transmitted to children thus it comes to pass that the descendants of the puritans now scattered over every part of the nation are predisposed to conceal the gentler emotions while their manners are calm decided and cold rather than free and impulsive of course there are very many exceptions to these predominating results the causes to which we may attribute a general want of courtesy in manners are certain incidental results of our democratic institutions our ancestors and their descendants have constantly been combating the aristocratic principle which would exalt one class of men at the expense of another they have had to contend with this principle not only in civil but in social life almost every american in his own person as well as in behalf of his class has had to assume and defend the main principle of democracythat every mans feelings and interests are equal in value to those of every other man but in doing this there has been some want of clear discrimination because claims based on distinctions of mere birth fortune or position were found to be injurious many have gone to the extreme of inferring that all distinctions involving subordination are useless such would regard children as equals to parents pupils to teachers domestics to their employers and subjects to magistrates and that too in all respects the fact that certain grades of superiority and subordination are needful both for individual and public benefit has not been clearly discerned and there has been a gradual tendency to an extreme which has sensibly affected our manners all the proprieties and courtesies which depend on the recognition of the relative duties of superior and subordinate have been warred upon and thus we see to an increasing extent disrespectful treatment of parents from children of teachers from pupils of employers from domestics and of the aged from the young in all classes and circles there is a gradual decay in courtesy of address in cases too where kindness is rendered it is often accompanied with a cold unsympathizing manner which greatly lessens its value while kindness or politeness is received in a similar style of coolness as if it were but the payment of a just due it is owing to these causes that the american people especially the inhabitants of new england do not do themselves justice for while those who are near enough to learn their real character and feelings can discern the most generous impulses and the most kindly sympathies they are so veiled in a composed and indifferent demeanor as to be almost entirely concealed from strangers these defects in our national manners it especially falls to the care of mothers and all who have charge of the young to rectify and if they seriously undertake the matter and wisely adapt means to ends these defects will be remedied with reference to this object the following ideas are suggested the law of christianity and of democracy which teaches that all men are born equal and that their interests and feelings should be regarded as of equal value seems to be adopted in aristocratic circles with exclusive reference to the class in which the individual moves the courtly gentleman addresses all of his own class with politeness and respect and in all his actions seems to allow that the feelings and convenience of others are to be regarded the same as his own but his demeanor to those of inferior station is not based on the same rule among those who make up aristocratic circles such as are above them are deemed of superior and such as are below of inferior value thus if a young ignorant and vicious coxcomb happens to be born a lord the aged the virtuous the learned and the wellbred of another class must give his convenience the precedence and must address him in terms of respect so when a man of noble birth is thrown among the lower classes he demeans himself in a style which to persons of his own class would be deemed the height of assumption and rudeness now the principles of democracy require that the same courtesy which we accord to our own circle shall be extended to every class and condition and that distinctions of superiority and subordination shall depend not on accidents of birth fortune or occupation but solely on those relations which the good of all classes equally require the distinctions demanded in a democratic state are simply those which result from relations that are common to every class and are for the benefit of all it is for the benefit of every class that children be subordinate to parents pupils to teachers the employed to their employers and subjects to magistrates in addition to this it is for the general wellbeing that the comfort or convenience of the delicate and feeble should be preferred to that of the strong and healthy who would suffer less by any deprivation and that precedence should be given to their elders by the young and that reverence should be given to the hoary head the rules of goodbreeding in a democratic state must be founded on these principles it is indeed assumed that the value of the happiness of each individual is the same as that of every other but as there must be occasions where there are advantages which all cannot enjoy there must be general rules for regulating a selection otherwise there would be constant scrambling among those of equal claims and brute force must be the final resort in which case the strongest would have the best of every thing the democratic rule then is that superiors in age station or office have precedence of subordinates age and feebleness of youth and strength and the feebler sex of more vigorous manm there is also a style of deportment and address which is appropriate to these different relations it is suitable for a superior to secure compliance with his wishes from those subordinate to him by commands but a subordinate must secure compliance with his wishes from a superior by requests it is suitable for a parent teacher or employer to admonish for neglect of duty but not for an inferior to adopt such a course towards a superior it is suitable for a superior to take precedence of a subordinate without any remark but not for an inferior without previously asking leave or offering an apology it is proper for a superior to use language and manners of freedom and familiarity which would be improper from a subordinate to a superior the want of due regard to these proprieties occasions the chief defect in american manners it is very common to hear children talk to their parents in a style proper only between companions and equals so also the young address their elders those employed their employers and domestics the members of the family and their visiters in a style which is inappropriate to their relative positions a respectful address is required not merely towards superiors every person desires to be treated with courtesy and respect and therefore the law of benevolence demands such demeanor towards all whom we meet in the social intercourse of life be ye courteous is the direction of the apostle in reference to our treatment of all goodmanners can be successfully cultivated only in early life and in the domestic circle there is nothing which depends so much upon habit as the constantly recurring proprieties of goodbreeding and if a child grows up without forming such habits it is very rarely the case that they can be formed at a later period the feeling that it is of little consequence how we behave at home if we conduct properly abroad is a very fallacious one persons who are careless and ill bred at home may imagine that they can assume goodmanners abroad but they mistake fixed habits of tone manner language and movements cannot be suddenly altered and those who are illbred at home even when they try to hide their bad habits are sure to violate many of the obvious rules of propriety and yet be unconscious of it and there is nothing which would so effectually remove prejudice against our democratic institutions as the general cultivation of goodbreeding in the domestic circle goodmanners are the exterior of benevolence the minute and often recurring exhibitions of peace and goodwill and the nation as well as the individual which most excels in the external as well as the internal principle will be most respected and beloved the following are the leading points which claim attention from those who have the care of the young in the first place in the family there should be required a strict attention to the rules of precedence and those modes of address appropriate to the various relations to be sustained children should always be required to offer their superiors in age or station the precedence in all comforts and conveniences and always address them in a respectful tone and manner the custom of adding sir or maam to yes or no is valuable as a perpetual indication of a respectful recognition of superiority it is now going out of fashion even among the most wellbred people probably from a want of consideration of its importance every remnant of courtesy of address in our customs should be carefully cherished by all who feel a value for the proprieties of goodbreeding if parents allow their children to talk to them and to the grown persons in the family in the same style in which they address each other it will be vain to hope for the courtesy of manner and tone which goodbreeding demands in the general intercourse of society in a large family where the elder children are grown up and the younger are small it is important to require the latter to treat the elder as superiors there are none so ready as young children to assume airs of equality and if they are allowed to treat one class of superiors in age and character disrespectfully they will soon use the privilege universally this is the reason why the youngest children of a family are most apt to be pert forward and unmannerly another point to be aimed at is to require children always to acknowledge every act of kindness and attention either by words or manner if they are so trained as always to make grateful acknowledgements when receiving favors one of the objectionable features in american manners will be avoided again children should be required to ask leave whenever they wish to gratify curiosity or use an article which belongs to another and if cases occur when they cannot comply with the rules of goodbreeding as for instance when they must step between a person and the fire or take the chair of an older person they should be required either to ask leave or to offer an apology there is another point of goodbreeding which cannot in all cases be understood and applied by children in its widest extent it is that which requires us to avoid all remarks which tend to embarrass vex mortify or in any way wound the feelings of another to notice personal defects to allude to others faults or the faults of their friends to speak disparagingly of the sect or party to which a person belongs to be inattentive when addressed in conversation to contradict flatly to speak in contemptuous tones of opinions expressed by anotherall these are violations of the rules of goodbreeding which children should be taught to regard under this head comes the practice of whispering and staring about when a teacher or lecturer or clergyman is addressing a class or audience such inattention is practically saying that what the person is uttering is not worth attending to and persons of real goodbreeding always avoid it loud talking and laughing in a large assembly even when no exercises are going on yawning and gaping in company and not looking in the face a person who is addressing you are deemed marks of illbreeding another branch of goodmanners relates to the duties of hospitality politeness requires us to welcome visiters with cordiality to offer them the best accommodations to address conversation to them and to express by tone and manner kindness and respect offering the hand to all visiters at ones own house is a courteous and hospitable custom and a cordial shake of the hand when friends meet would abate much of the coldness of manner ascribed to americans the last point of goodbreeding to be noticed refers to the conventional rules of propriety and good taste of these the first class relates to the avoidance of all disgusting or offensive personal habits such as fingering the hair cleaning the teeth or nails picking the nose spitting on carpets snuffing instead of using a handkerchief or using the article in an offensive manner lifting up the boots or shoes as some men do to tend them on the knee or to finger themall these tricks either at home or in society children should be taught to avoid another branch under this head may be called table manners to persons of goodbreeding nothing is more annoying than violating the conventional proprieties of the table reaching over another persons plate standing up to reach distant articles instead of asking to have them passed using ones own knife and spoon for butter salt or sugar when it is the custom of the family to provide separate utensils for the purpose setting cups with tea dripping from them on the tablecloth instead of the mats or small plates furnished using the tablecloth instead of the napkins eating fast and in a noisy manner putting large pieces in the mouth looking and eating as if very hungry or as if anxious to get at certain dishes sitting at too great a distance from the table and dropping food laying the knife and fork on the tablecloth instead of on the bread or the edge of the plateall these particulars children should be taught to avoid it is always desirable too to require children when at table with grown persons to be silent except when addressed by others or else their chattering will interrupt the conversation and comfort of their elders they should always be required too to wait in silence till all the older persons are helped all these things should be taught to children gradually and with great patience and gentleness some parents with whom goodmanners is a great object are in danger of making their children perpetually uncomfortable by suddenly surrounding them with so many rules that they must inevitably violate some one or other a great part of the time it is much better to begin with a few rules and be steady and persevering with these till a habit is formed and then take a few more thus making the process easy and gradual otherwise the temper of children will be injured or hopeless of fulfilling so many requisitions they will become reckless and indifferent to all but in reference to those who have enjoyed advantages for the cultivation of goodmanners and who duly estimate its importance one caution is necessary those who never have had such habits formed in youth are under disadvantages which no benevolence of temper can remedy they may often violate the tastes and feelings of others not from a want of proper regard for them but from ignorance of custom or want of habit or abstraction of mind or from other causes which demand forbearance and sympathy rather than displeasure an ability to bear patiently with defects in manners and to make candid and considerate allowance for a want of advantages or for peculiarities in mental habits is one mark of the benevolence of real goodbreeding the advocates of monarchical and aristocratic institutions have always had great plausibility given to their views by the seeming tendencies to insubordination and badmanners of our institutions and it has been too indiscriminately conceded by the defenders of the latter that such are these tendencies and that the offensive points in american manners are the necessary result of democratic principles but it is believed that both facts and reasoning are in opposition to this opinion the following extract from the work of de tocqueville exhibits the opinion of an impartial observer when comparing american manners with those of the english who are confessedly the most aristocratic of all people he previously remarks on the tendency of aristocracy to make men more sympathizing with persons of their own peculiar class and less so towards those of lower degree and he then contrasts american manners with the english claiming that the americans are much the most affable mild and social in america where the privileges of birth never existed and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors men acquainted with each other are very ready to frequent the same places and find neither peril nor advantage in the free interchange of their thoughts if they meet by accident they neither seek nor avoid intercourse their manner is therefore natural frank and open if their demeanor is often cold and serious it is never haughty or constrained but an aristocratic pride is still extremely great among the english and as the limits of aristocracy are illdefined every body lives in constant dread lest advantage should be taken of his familiarity unable to judge at once of the social position of those he meets an englishman prudently avoids all contact with them men are afraid lest some slight service rendered should draw them into an unsuitable acquaintance they dread civilities and they avoid the obtrusive gratitude of a stranger as much as his hatred thus facts seem to show that when the most aristocratic nation in the world is compared as to manners with the most democratic the judgement of strangers is in favor of the latter and if goodmanners are the outward exhibition of the democratic principle of impartial benevolence and equal rights surely the nation which adopts this rule both in social and civil life is the most likely to secure the desirable exterior the aristocrat by his principles extends the exterior of impartial benevolence to his own class only the democratic principle requires it to be extended to all there is reason therefore to hope and expect more refined and polished manners in america than in any other land while all the developements of taste and refinement such as poetry music painting sculpture and architecture it may be expected will come to a higher state of perfection here than in any other nation if this country increases in virtue and intelligence as it may there is no end to the wealth which will pour in as the result of our resources of climate soil and navigation and the skill industry energy and enterprise of our countrymen this wealth if used as intelligence and virtue dictate will furnish the means for a superior education to all classes and every facility for the refinement of taste intellect and feeling moreover in this country labor is ceasing to be the badge of a lower class so that already it is disreputable for a man to be a lazy gentleman and this feeling must increase till there is such an equalisation of labor as will afford all the time needful for every class to improve the many advantages offered to them already in boston through the munificence of some of her citizens there are literary and scientific advantages offered to all classes rarely enjoyed elsewhere in cincinnati too the advantages of education now offered to the poorest classes without charge surpass what some years ago most wealthy men could purchase for any price and it is believed that a time will come when the poorest boy in america can secure advantages which will equal what the heir of the proudest peerage can now command the records of the courts of france and germany as detailed by the duchess of orleans in and succeeding the brilliant reign of louis the fourteentha period which was deemed the acme of elegance and refinementexhibit a grossness a vulgarity and a coarseness not to be found among the lowest of our respectable poor and the biography of beau nash who attempted to reform the manners of the gentry in the times of queen anne exhibits violations of the rules of decency among the aristocracy which the commonest yeoman of this land would feel disgraced in perpetrating this shows that our lowest classes at this period are more refined than were the highest in aristocratic lands a hundred years ago and another century may show the lowest classes in wealth in this country attaining as high a polish as adorns those who now are leaders of goodmanners in the courts of kings footnote m the universal practice of this nation in thus giving precedence to woman has been severely commented on by miss martineau and some others who would transfer all the business of the other sex to women and then have them treated like men may this evidence of our superior civilisation and christianity increase rather than diminish chapter xiii on the preservation of a good temper in a housekeeper there is nothing which has a more abiding influence on the happiness of a family than the preservation of equable and cheerful temper and tones in the housekeeper a woman who is habitually gentle sympathizing forbearing and cheerful carries an atmosphere about her which imparts a soothing and sustaining influence and renders it easier for all to do right under her administration than in any other situation the writer has known families where the mothers presence seemed the sunshine of the circle around her imparting a cheering and vivifying power scarcely realized till it was withdrawn every one without thinking of it or knowing why it was so experienced a peaceful and invigorating influence as soon as he entered the sphere illumined by her smile and sustained by her cheering kindness and sympathy on the contrary many a good housekeeper good in every respect but this by wearing a countenance of anxiety and dissatisfaction and by indulging in the frequent use of sharp and reprehensive tones more than destroys all the comfort which otherwise would result from her system neatness and economy there is a secret social sympathy which every mind to a greater or less degree experiences with the feelings of those around as they are manifested by the countenance and voice a sorrowful a discontented or an angry countenance produces a silent sympathetic influence imparting a sombre shade to the mind while tones of anger or complaint still more effectually jar the spirits no person can maintain a quiet and cheerful frame of mind while tones of discontent and displeasure are sounding on the ear we may gradually accustom ourselves to the evil till it is partially diminished but it always is an evil which greatly interferes with the enjoyment of the family state there are sometimes cases where the entrance of the mistress of a family seems to awaken a slight apprehension in every mind around as if each felt in danger of a reproof for something either perpetrated or neglected a woman who should go around her house with a small stinging snapper which she habitually applied to those whom she met would be encountered with feelings very much like to those which are experienced by the inmates of a family where the mistress often uses her countenance and voice to inflict similar penalties for duties neglected yet there are many allowances to be made for housekeepers who sometimes imperceptibly and unconsciously fall into such habits a woman who attempts to carry out any plans of system order and economy and who has her feelings and habits conformed to certain rules is constantly liable to have her plans crossed and her taste violated by the inexperience or inattention of those about her and no housekeeper whatever may be her habits can escape the frequent recurrence of negligence or mistake which interferes with her plans it is probable that there is no class of persons in the world who have such incessant trials of temper and temptations to be fretful as american housekeepers for a housekeepers business is not like that of the other sex limited to a particular department for which previous preparation is made it consists of ten thousand little disconnected items which can never be so systematically arranged that there is no daily jostling somewhere and in the bestregulated families it is not unfrequently the case that some act of forgetfulness or carelessness from some member will disarrange the business of the whole day so that every hour will bring renewed occasion for annoyance and the more strongly a woman realizes the value of time and the importance of system and order the more will she be tempted to irritability and complaint the following considerations may aid in preparing a woman to meet such daily crosses with even a cheerful temper and tones in the first place a woman who has charge of a large household should regard her duties as dignified important and difficult the mind is so made as to be elevated and cheered by a sense of farreaching influence and usefulness a woman who feels that she is a cipher and that it makes little difference how she performs her duties has far less to sustain and invigorate her than one who truly estimates the importance of her station a man who feels that the destinies of a nation are turning on the judgement and skill with which he plans and executes has a pressure of motive and an elevation of feeling which are great safeguards from all that is low trivial and degrading so an american mother and housekeeper who looks at her position in the aspect presented in the previous pages and who rightly estimates the long train of influences which will pass down to thousands whose destinies from generation to generation will be modified by those decisions of her will which regulated the temper principles and habits of her family must be elevated above petty temptations which would otherwise assail her again a housekeeper should feel that she really has great difficulties to meet and overcome a person who wrongly thinks there is little danger can never maintain so faithful a guard as one who rightly estimates the temptations which beset her nor can one who thinks that they are trifling difficulties which she has to encounter and trivial temptations to which she must yield so much enjoy the just reward of conscious virtue and selfcontrol as one who takes an opposite view of the subject a third method is for a woman deliberately to calculate on having her bestarranged plans interfered with very often and to be in such a state of preparation that the evil will not come unawares so complicated are the pursuits and so diverse the habits of the various members of a family that it is almost impossible for every one to avoid interfering with the plans and taste of a housekeeper in some one point or another it is therefore most wise for a woman to keep the loins of her mind ever girt to meet such collisions with a cheerful and quiet spirit another important rule is to form all plans and arrangements in consistency with the means at command and the character of those around a woman who has a heedless husband and young children and incompetent domestics ought not to make such plans as one may properly form who will not in so many directions meet embarrassment she must aim at just so much as she can probably secure and no more and thus she will usually escape much temptation and much of the irritation of disappointment the fifth and a very important consideration is that system economy and neatness are valuable only so far as they tend to promote the comfort and wellbeing of those affected some women seem to act under the impression that these advantages must be secured at all events even if the comfort of the family be the sacrifice true it is very important that children grow up in habits of system neatness and order and it is very desirable that the mother give them every incentive both by precept and example but it is still more important that they grow up with amiable tempers that they learn to meet the crosses of life with patience and cheerfulness and nothing has a greater influence to secure this than a mothers example whenever therefore a woman cannot accomplish her plans of neatness and order without injury to her own temper or to the temper of others she ought to modify and reduce them until she can the sixth method relates to the government of the tones of voice in many cases when a womans domestic arrangements are suddenly and seriously crossed it is impossible not to feel some irritation but it is always possible to refrain from angry tones a woman can resolve that whatever happens she will not speak till she can do it in a calm and gentle manner perfect silence is a safe resort when such control cannot be attained as enables a person to speak calmly and this determination persevered in will eventually be crowned with success many persons seem to imagine that tones of anger are needful in order to secure prompt obedience but observation has convinced the writer that they are never necessary that in all cases reproof administered in calm tones would be better a case will be given in illustration a young girl had been repeatedly charged to avoid a certain arrangement in cooking on one day when company was invited to dine the direction was forgotten and the consequence was an accident which disarranged every thing seriously injured the principal dish and delayed dinner for an hour the mistress of the family entered the kitchen just as it occurred and at a glance saw the extent of the mischief for a moment her eyes flashed and her cheeks glowed but she held her peace after a minute or so she gave directions in a calm voice as to the best mode of retrieving the evil and then left without a word said to the offender after the company left she sent for the girl alone and in a calm and kind manner pointed out the aggravations of the case and described the trouble which had been caused to her husband her visiters and herself she then portrayed the future evils which would result from such habits of neglect and inattention and the modes of attempting to overcome them and then offered a reward for the future if in a given time she succeeded in improving in this respect not a tone of anger was uttered and yet the severest scolding of a practised xantippe could not have secured such contrition and determination to reform as was gained by this method but similar negligence is often visited by a continuous stream of complaint and reproof which in most cases is met either by sullen silence or impertinent retort while anger prevents any contrition or any resolution of future amendment it is very certain that some ladies do carry forward a most efficient government both of children and domestics without employing tones of anger and therefore they are not indispensable nor on any account desirable though some ladies of intelligence and refinement do fall unconsciously into such a practice it is certainly very unladylike and in very bad taste to scold and the further a woman departs from all approach to it the more perfectly she sustains her character as a lady another method of securing equanimity amid the trials of domestic life is to cultivate a habit of making allowances for the difficulties ignorance or temptations of those who violate rule or neglect duty it is vain and most unreasonable to expect the consideration and care of a mature mind in childhood and youth or that persons of such limited advantages as most domestics have enjoyed should practise proper selfcontrol and possess proper habits and principles every parent and every employer needs daily to cultivate the spirit expressed in the divine prayer forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us the same allowances and forbearance which we supplicate from our heavenly father and desire from our fellowmen in reference to our own deficiencies we should constantly aim to extend to all who cross our feelings and interfere with our plans the last and most important mode of securing a placid and cheerful temper and tones is by a right view of the doctrine of a superintending providence all persons are too much in the habit of regarding the more important events of life as exclusively under the control of perfect wisdom but the fall of a sparrow or the loss of a hair they do not feel to be equally the result of his directing agency in consequence of this christian persons who aim at perfect and cheerful submission to heavy afflictions and who succeed to the edification of all about them are sometimes sadly deficient under petty crosses if a beloved child be laid in the grave even if its death resulted from the carelessness of a domestic or of a physician the eye is turned from the subordinate agent to the supreme guardian of all and to him they bow without murmur or complaint but if a pudding be burnt or a room badly swept or an errand forgotten then vexation and complaint are allowed just as if these events were not appointed by perfect wisdom as much as the sorer chastisement a woman therefore needs to cultivate the habitual feeling that all the events of her nursery and kitchen are brought about by the permission of our heavenly father and that fretfulness or complaint in regard to these is in fact complaining and disputing at the appointments of god and is really as sinful as unsubmissive murmurs amid the sorer chastisements of his hand and a woman who cultivates this habit of referring all the minor trials of life to the wise and benevolent agency of a heavenly parent and daily seeks his sympathy and aid to enable her to meet them with a quiet and cheerful spirit will soon find it the perennial spring of abiding peace and content chapter xiv on habits of system and order the discussion of the question of the equality of the sexes in intellectual capacity seems frivolous and useless both because it can never be decided and because there would be no possible advantage in the decision but one topic which is often drawn into this discussion is of far more consequence and that is the relative importance and difficulty of the duties a woman is called to perform it is generally assumed and almost as generally conceded that womans business and cares are contracted and trivial and that the proper discharge of her duties demands far less expansion of mind and vigor of intellect than the pursuits of the other sex this idea has prevailed because women as a mass have never been educated with reference to their most important duties while that portion of their employments which is of least value has been regarded as the chief if not the sole concern of a woman the covering of the body the conveniences of residences and the gratification of the appetite have been too much regarded as the sole objects on which her intellectual powers are to be exercised but as society gradually shakes off the remnants of barbarism and the intellectual and moral interests of man rise in estimation above the merely sensual a truer estimate is formed of womans duties and of the measure of intellect requisite for the proper discharge of them let any man of sense and discernment become the member of a large household in which a welleducated and pious woman is endeavoring systematically to discharge her multiform duties let him fully comprehend all her cares difficulties and perplexities and it is probable he would coincide in the opinion that no statesman at the head of a nations affairs had more frequent calls for wisdom firmness tact discrimination prudence and versatility of talent than such a woman she has a husband to whose peculiar tastes and habits she must accommodate herself she has children whose health she must guard whose physical constitutions she must study and develope whose temper and habits she must regulate whose principles she must form whose pursuits she must direct she has constantly changing domestics with all varieties of temper and habits whom she must govern instruct and direct she is required to regulate the finances of the domestic state and constantly to adapt expenditures to the means and to the relative claims of each department she has the direction of the kitchen where ignorance forgetfulness and awkwardness are to be so regulated that the various operations shall each start at the right time and all be in completeness at the same given hour she has the claims of society to meet calls to receive and return and the duties of hospitality to sustain she has the poor to relieve benevolent societies to aid the schools of her children to inquire and decide about the care of the sick the nursing of infancy and the endless miscellany of odd items constantly recurring in a large family surely it is a pernicious and mistaken idea that the duties which tax a womans mind are petty trivial or unworthy of the highest grade of intellect and moral worth instead of allowing this feeling every woman should imbibe from early youth the impression that she is training for the discharge of the most important the most difficult and the most sacred and interesting duties that can possibly employ the highest intellect she ought to feel that her station and responsibilities in the great drama of life are second to none either as viewed by her maker or in the estimation of all minds whose judgement is most worthy of respect she who is the mother and housekeeper in a large family is the sovereign of an empire demanding more varied cares and involving more difficult duties than are really exacted of her who while she wears the crown and professedly regulates the interests of the greatest nation on earth finds abundant leisure for theatres balls horseraces and every gay pursuit there is no one thing more necessary to a housekeeper in performing her varied duties than a habit of system and order and yet the peculiarly desultory nature of womens pursuits and the embarrassments resulting from the state of domestic service in this country render it very difficult to form such a habit but it is sometimes the case that women who could and would carry forward a systematic plan of domestic economy do not attempt it simply from a want of knowledge of the various modes of introducing it it is with reference to such that various modes of securing system and order which the writer has seen adopted will be pointed out a wise economy is nowhere more conspicuous than in the right apportionment of time to different pursuits there are duties of a religious intellectual social and domestic nature each having different relative claims on attention unless a person has some general plan of apportioning these claims some will intrench on others and some it is probable will be entirely excluded thus some find religious social and domestic duties so numerous that no time is given to intellectual improvement others find either social or benevolent or religious interests excluded by the extent and variety of other engagements it is wise therefore for all persons to devise a general plan which they will at least keep in view and aim to accomplish and by which a proper proportion of time shall be secured for all the duties of life in forming such a plan every woman must accommodate herself to the peculiarities of her situation if she has a large family and a small income she must devote far more time to the simple duty of providing food and raiment than would be right were she in affluence and with a small family it is impossible therefore to draw out any general plan which all can adopt but there are some general principles which ought to be the guiding rules when a woman arranges her domestic employments these principles are to be based on christianity which teaches us to seek first the kingdom of god and to deem food raiment and the conveniences of life as of secondary account every woman then ought to start with the assumption that religion is of more consequence than any worldly concern and that whatever else may be sacrificed this shall be the leading object in all her arrangements in respect to time money and attention it is also one of the plainest requisitions of christianity that we devote some of our time and efforts to the comfort and improvement of others there is no duty so constantly enforced both in the old and new testament as the duty of charity in dispensing to those who are destitute of the blessings we enjoy in selecting objects of charity the same rule applies to others as to ourselves their moral and religious interests are of the highest moment and for them as well as for ourselves we are to seek first the kingdom of god another general principle is that our intellectual and social interests are to be preferred to the mere gratification of taste or appetite a portion of time therefore must be devoted to the cultivation of the intellect and the social affections another is that the mere gratification of appetite is to be placed last in our estimate so that when a question arises as to which shall be sacrificed some intellectual moral or social advantage or some gratification of sense we should invariably sacrifice the last another is that as health is indispensable to the discharge of every duty nothing which sacrifices that blessing is to be allowed in order to gain any other advantage or enjoyment there are emergencies when it is right to risk health and life to save ourselves and others from greater evils but these are exceptions which do not militate against the general rule many persons imagine that if they violate the laws of health in performing religious or domestic duties they are guiltless before god but such greatly mistake we as directly violate the law thou shalt not kill when we do what tends to risk or shorten our own life as if we should intentionally run a dagger into a neighbor true we may escape any fatal or permanently injurious effects and so may a dagger or bullet miss the mark or do only transient injury but this in either case makes the sin none the less the life and happiness of all his creatures are dear to our creator and he is as much displeased when we injure our own interests as when we injure those of others the idea therefore that we are excusable if we harm no one but ourselves is false and pernicious these then are the general principles to guide a woman in systematizing her duties and pursuits the creator of all things is a being of perfect system and order and to aid us in our duty in this respect he has divided our time by a regularly returning day of rest from worldly business in following this example the intervening six days may be subdivided to secure similar benefits in doing this a certain portion of time must be given to procure the means of livelihood and for preparing food raiment and dwellings to these objects some must devote more and others less attention the remainder of time not necessarily thus employed might be divided somewhat in this manner the leisure of two afternoons and evenings could be devoted to religious and benevolent objects such as religious meetings charitable associations school visiting and attention to the sick and poor the leisure of two other days might be devoted to intellectual improvement and the pursuits of taste the leisure of another day might be devoted to social enjoyments in making or receiving visits and that of another to miscellaneous domestic pursuits not included in the other particulars it is probable that few persons could carry out such an arrangement very strictly but every one can make a systematic apportionment of time and at least aim at accomplishing it and they can also compare the time which they actually devote to these different objects with such a general outline for the purpose of modifying any mistaken proportions without attempting any such systematic employment of time and carrying it out so far as they can control circumstances most women are rather driven along by the daily occurrences of life so that instead of being the intelligent regulators of their own time they are the mere sport of circumstances there is nothing which so distinctly marks the difference between weak and strong minds as the fact whether they control circumstances or circumstances control them it is very much to be feared that the apportionment of time actually made by most women exactly inverts the order required by reason and christianity thus the furnishing a needless variety of food the conveniences of dwellings and the adornments of dress often take a larger portion of time than is given to any other object next after this comes intellectual improvement and last of all benevolence and religion it may be urged that it is indispensable for most persons to give more time to earn a livelihood and to prepare food raiment and dwellings than to any other object but it may be asked how much of the time devoted to these objects is employed in preparing varieties of food not necessary but rather injurious and how much is spent for those parts of dress and furniture not indispensable and merely ornamental let a woman subtract from her domestic employments all the time given to pursuits which are of no use except as they gratify a taste for ornament or minister increased varieties to tempt the appetite and she will find that much which she calls domestic duties and which prevent her attention to intellectual benevolent and religious objects should be called by a very different name no woman has a right to give up attention to the higher interests of herself and others for the ornaments of taste or the gratification of the palate to a certain extent these lower objects are lawful and desirable but when they intrude on nobler interests they become selfish and degrading every woman then when employing her hands in ornamenting her person her children or her house ought to calculate whether she has devoted as much time to the intellectual and moral wants of herself and others if she has not she may know that she is doing wrong and that her system for apportioning her time and pursuits should be altered some persons endeavor to systematize their pursuits by apportioning them to particular hours of each day for example a certain period before breakfast is given to devotional duties after breakfast certain hours are devoted to exercise and domestic employments other hours to sewing or reading or visiting and others to benevolent duties but in most cases it is more difficult to systematize the hours of each day than it is to secure some regular division of the week in regard to the minuti of domestic arrangements the writer has known the following methods to be adopted monday with some of the best housekeepers is devoted to preparing for the labors of the week any extra cooking the purchasing of articles to be used during the week the assorting of clothes for the wash and mending such as would be injured withoutthese and similar items belong to this day tuesday is devoted to washing and wednesday to ironing on thursday the ironing is finished off the clothes are folded and put away and all articles which need mending are put in the mending basket and attended to friday is devoted to sweeping and housecleaning on saturday and especially the last saturday of every month every department is put in order the castors and table furniture are regulated the pantry and cellar inspected the trunks drawers and closets arranged and every thing about the house put in order for sunday all the cooking needed for sunday is also prepared by this regular recurrence of a particular time for inspecting every thing nothing is forgotten till ruined by neglect another mode of systematizing relates to providing proper supplies of conveniences and proper places in which to keep them thus some ladies keep a large closet in which are placed the tubs pails dippers soapdishes starch bluing clothesline clothespins and every other article used in washing and in the same or another place are kept every convenience for ironing in the sewing department a trunk with suitable partitions is provided in which are placed each in its proper place white thread of all sizes colored thread yarns for mending colored and black sewingsilks and twist tapes and bobbins of all sizes white and colored weltingcords silk braids and cords needles of all sizes papers of pins remnants of linen and colored cambric a supply of all kinds of buttons used in the family black and white hooks and eyes a yard measure and all the patterns used in cutting and fitting these are done up in separate parcels and labelled in another trunk are kept all pieces used in mending arranged in order so that any article can be found without loss of time a trunk like the first mentioned will save many steps and often much time and perplexity while by purchasing articles thus by the quantity they come much cheaper than if bought in little portions as they are wanted such a trunk should be kept locked and a smaller supply for current use retained in a workbasket a full supply of all conveniences in the kitchen and cellar and a place appointed for each article very much facilitates domestic labor for want of this much vexation and loss of time is occasioned while seeking vessels in use or in cleansing those employed by different persons for various purposes it would be far better for a lady to give up some expensive article in the parlor and apply the money thus saved for kitchen conveniences than to have a stinted supply where the most labor is to be performed if our countrywomen would devote more to comfort and convenience and less to show it would be a great improvement expensive mirrors and piertables in the parlor and an unpainted gloomy illfurnished kitchen not unfrequently are found under the same roof another important item in systematic economy is the apportioning of regular employment to the various members of a family if a housekeeper can secure the cooperation of all her family she will find that many hands make light work there is no greater mistake than in bringing up children to feel that they must be taken care of and waited on by others without any corresponding obligations on their part the extent to which young children can be made useful in a family would seem surprising to those who have never seen a systematic and regular plan for securing their services the writer has been in a family where a little girl of eight or nine years of age washed and dressed herself and young brother and made their small beds before breakfast set and cleared all the tables at meals with a little help from a grown person in moving tables and spreading cloths while all the dusting of parlors and chambers was also neatly performed by her a brother of ten years old brought in and piled all the wood used in the kitchen and parlor brushed the boots and shoes neatly went on errands and took all the care of the poultry they were children whose parents could afford to hire servants to do this but who chose to have their children grow up healthy and industrious while proper instruction system and encouragement made these services rather a pleasure than otherwise to the children some parents pay their children for such services but this is hazardous as tending to make them feel that they are not bound to be helpful without pay and also as tending to produce a hoarding moneymaking spirit but where children have no hoarding propensities and need to acquire a sense of the value of property it may be well to let them earn money for some extra services rather as a favor when this is done they should be taught to spend it for others as well as for themselves and in this way a generous and liberal spirit will be cultivated there are some mothers who take pains to teach their boys most of the domestic arts which their sisters learn the writer has seen boys mending their own garments and aiding their mother or sisters in the kitchen with great skill and adroitness and at an early age they usually very much relish joining in such occupations the sons of such mothers in their college life or in roaming about the world or in nursing a sick wife or infant find occasion to bless the forethought and kindness which prepared them for such emergencies few things are in worse taste than for a man needlessly to busy himself in womens work and yet a man never appears in a more interesting attitude than when by skill in such matters he can save a mother or wife from care and suffering the more a boy is taught to use his hands in every variety of domestic employment the more his faculties both of mind and body are developed for mechanical pursuits exercise the intellect as well as the hands the early training of newengland boys in which they turn their hand to almost every thing is one great reason of the quick perceptions versatility of mind and mechanical skill for which that portion of our countrymen is distinguished the writer has known one mode of systematizing the aid of the older children in a family which in some cases of very large families it may be well to imitate in the case referred to when the oldest daughter was eight or nine years old an infant sister was given to her as her special charge she tended it made and mended its clothes taught it to read and was its nurse and guardian through all its childhood another infant was given to the next daughter and thus the children were all paired in this interesting relation in addition to the relief thus afforded to the mother the elder children were in this way qualified for their future domestic relations and both older and younger bound to each other by peculiar ties of tenderness and gratitude in offering these examples of various modes of systematizing one suggestion may be worthy of attention it is not unfrequently the case that ladies who find themselves cumbered with oppressive cares after reading remarks on the benefits of system immediately commence the task of arranging their pursuits with great vigor and hope they divide the day into regular periods and give each hour its duty they systematize their work and endeavor to bring every thing into a regular routine but in a short time they find themselves baffled discouraged and disheartened and finally relapse into their former desultory ways in a sort of resigned despair the difficulty in such cases is that they attempt too much at a time there is nothing which so much depends upon habit as a systematic mode of performing duty and where no such habit has been formed it is impossible for a novice to start at once into a universal mode of systematizing which none but an adept could carry through the only way for such persons is to begin with a little at a time let them select some three or four things and resolutely attempt to conquer at these points in time a habit will be formed of doing a few things at regular periods and in a systematic way then it will be easy to add a few more and thus by a gradual process the object can be secured which it would be vain to attempt by a more summary course early rising is almost an indispensable condition to success in such an effort but where a woman lacks either the health or the energy to secure a period for devotional duties before breakfast let her select that hour of the day in which she will be least liable to interruption and let her then seek strength and wisdom from the only true source at this time let her take a pen and make a list of all the things which she considers as duties then let a calculation be made whether there be time enough in the day or the week for all these duties if there be not let the least important be stricken from the list as not being duties and which must be omitted in doing this let a woman remember that though what we shall eat and what we shall drink and wherewithal we shall be clothed are matters requiring due attention they are very apt to obtain a wrong relative importance while social intellectual and moral interests receive too little regard in this country eating dressing and household furniture and ornaments take far too large a place in the estimate of relative importance and it is probable that most women could modify their views and practice so as to come nearer to the saviours requirements no woman has a right to put a stitch of ornament on any article of dress or furniture or to provide one superfluity in food until she is sure she can secure time for all her social intellectual benevolent and religious duties if a woman will take the trouble to make such a calculation as this she will usually find that she has time enough to perform all her duties easily and well it is impossible for a conscientious woman to secure that peaceful mind and cheerful enjoyment of life which all should seek who is constantly finding her duties jarring with each other and much remaining undone which she feels that she ought to do in consequence of this there will be a secret uneasiness which will throw a shade over the whole current of life never to be removed till she so efficiently defines and regulates her duties that she can fulfil them all and here the writer would urge upon young ladies the importance of forming habits of system while unembarrassed with those multiplied cares which will make the task so much more difficult and hopeless every young lady can systematize her pursuits to a certain extent she can have a particular day for mending her wardrobe and for arranging her trunks closets and drawers she can keep her workbasket her desk at school and all her other conveniences in their proper places and in regular order she can have regular periods for reading walking visiting study and domestic pursuits and by following this method in youth she will form a taste for regularity and a habit of system which will prove a blessing to her through life chapter xv on giving in charity it is probable that there is no point of duty where conscientious persons differ more in opinion or where they find it more difficult to form discriminating and decided views than on the matter of charity that we are bound to give some of our time money and efforts to relieve the destitute all allow but as to how much we are to give and on whom our charities shall be bestowed many a reflecting mind has been at a loss yet it seems very desirable that in reference to a duty so constantly and so strenuously urged by the supreme ruler we should be able so to fix metes and bounds as to keep a conscience void of offence and to free the mind from disquieting fears of deficiency the writer has found no other topic of investigation so beset with difficulty and so absolutely without the range of definite rules which can apply to all in all circumstances but on this as on a previous topic there seem to be general principles by the aid of which any candid mind sincerely desirous of obeying the commands of christ however much selfdenial may be involved can arrive at definite conclusions as to its own individual obligations so that when these are fulfilled the mind may be at peace but for a mind that is worldly living mainly to seek its own pleasures instead of living to please god no principles can be so fixed as not to leave a ready escape from all obligation such minds either by indolence and consequent ignorance or by sophistry will convince themselves that a life of engrossing selfindulgence with perhaps the gift of a few dollars and a few hours of time may suffice to fulfil the requisitions of the eternal judge for such minds no reasonings will avail till the heart is so changed that to learn the will and follow the example of jesus christ become the leading objects of interest and effort it is to aid those who profess to possess this temper of mind that the following suggestions are offered the first consideration which gives definiteness to this subject is a correct view of the object for which we are placed in this world a great many even of professed christians seem to be acting on the supposition that the object of life is to secure as much as possible of all the various enjoyments placed within reach not so teaches reason or revelation from these we learn that though the happiness of his creatures is the end for which god created and sustains them yet that this happiness depends not on the various modes of gratification put within our reach but mainly on character a man may possess all the resources for enjoyment which this world can afford and yet feel that all is vanity and vexation of spirit and that he is supremely wretched another may be in want of all things and yet possess that living spring of benevolence faith and hope which will make an eden of the darkest prison in order to be perfectly happy man must attain that character which christ exhibited and the nearer he approaches it the more will happiness reign in his breast but what was the grand peculiarity of the character of christ it was selfdenying benevolence he came not to seek his own he went about doing good and this was his meat and drink that is it was this which sustained the health and life of his mind as food and drink sustain the health and life of the body now the mind of man is so made that it can gradually be transformed into the same likeness a selfish being who for a whole life has been nourishing habits of indolent selfindulgence can by taking christ as his example by communion with him and by daily striving to imitate his character and conduct form such a temper of mind that doing good will become the chief and highest source of enjoyment and this heavenly principle will grow stronger and stronger until selfdenial loses the more painful part of its character and then living to make happiness will be so delightful and absorbing a pursuit that all exertions regarded as the means to this end will be like the joyous efforts of men when they strive for a prize or a crown with the full hope of success in this view of the subject efforts and selfdenial for the good of others are to be regarded not merely as duties enjoined for the benefit of others but as the moral training indispensable to the formation of that character on which depends our own happiness this view exhibits the full meaning of the saviours declaration how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god he had before taught that the kingdom of heaven consisted not in such enjoyments as the worldly seek but in the temper of selfdenying benevolence like his own and as the rich have far greater temptations to indolent selfindulgence they are far less likely to acquire this temper than those who by limited means are inured to some degree of selfdenial but on this point one important distinction needs to be made and that is between the selfdenial which has no other aim than mere selfmortification and that which is exercised to secure greater good to ourselves and others the first is the foundation of monasticism penances and all other forms of asceticism the latter only is that which christianity requires a second consideration which may give definiteness to this subject is that the formation of a perfect character involves not the extermination of any principles of our nature but rather the regulating of them according to the rules of reason and religion so that the lower propensities shall always be kept subordinate to nobler principles thus we are not to aim at destroying our appetites or at needlessly denying them but rather so to regulate them that they shall best secure the objects for which they were implanted we are not to annihilate the love of praise and admiration but so to control it that the favor of god shall be regarded more than the estimation of men we are not to extirpate the principle of curiosity which leads us to acquire knowledge but so to direct it that all our acquisitions shall be useful and not frivolous or injurious and thus with all the principles of the mind god has implanted no desires in our constitution which are evil and pernicious on the contrary all our constitutional propensities either of mind or body he designed we should gratify whenever no evils would thence result either to ourselves or others such passions as envy ambition pride revenge and hatred are to be exterminated for they are either excesses or excrescences not created by god but rather the result of our own neglect to form habits of benevolence and selfcontrol in deciding the rules of our conduct therefore we are ever to bear in mind that the developement of the nobler principles and the subjugation of inferior propensities to them is to be the main object of effort both for ourselves and for others and in conformity with this in all our plans we are to place religious and moral interests as first in estimation our social and intellectual interests next and our physical gratifications as subordinate to all a third consideration is that though the means for sustaining life and health are to be regarded as necessaries without which no other duties can be performed yet that a very large portion of the time spent by most persons in easy circumstances for food raiment and dwellings are for mere superfluities which are right when they do not involve the sacrifice of higher interests and wrong when they do life and health can be sustained in the humblest dwellings with the plainest dress and the simplest food and after taking from our means what is necessary for life and health the remainder is to be so divided that the larger portion shall be given to supply the moral and intellectual wants of ourselves and others and the smaller share to procure those additional gratifications of taste and appetite which are desirable but not indispensable mankind thus far have never made this apportionment of their means yet just as fast as they have risen from a savage state mere physical wants have been made to an increasing extent subordinate to higher objects another very important consideration is that in urging the duty of charity and the prior claims of moral and religious objects no rule of duty should be maintained which it would not be right and wise for all to follow and we are to test the wisdom of any general rule by inquiring what would be the result if all mankind should practise according to it in view of this we are enabled to judge of the correctness of those who maintain that to be consistent men believing in the eternal destruction of all those of our race who are not brought under the influence of the christian system should give up not merely the elegances but all the superfluities of life and devote the whole of their means not indispensable to life and health for the propagation of christianity but if this is the duty of any it is the duty of all and we are to inquire what would be the result if all conscientious persons gave up the use of all superfluities suppose that two millions of the people in the united states were conscientious persons and relinquished the use of every thing not absolutely necessary to life and health it would instantly throw out of employment one half of the whole community the manufacturers mechanics merchants agriculturists and all the agencies they employ would be beggared and one half of those not reduced to poverty would be obliged to spend all their extra means in simply supplying necessaries to the other half the use of superfluities therefore to a certain extent is as indispensable to promote industry virtue and religion as any direct giving of money or time and it is owing entirely to a want of reflection and of comprehensive views that any men ever make so great a mistake as is here exhibited instead then of urging a rule of duty which is at once irrational and impracticable there is another course which commends itself to the understandings of all for whatever may be the practice of intelligent men they universally concede the principle that our physical gratifications should always be made subordinate to social intellectual and moral advantages and all that is required for the advancement of our whole race to the most perfect state of society is simply that men should act in agreement with this principle and if only a very small portion of the most intelligent of our race should act according to this rule under the control of christian benevolence the immense supplies furnished for the general good would be far beyond what any would imagine who had never made any calculations on the subject in this nation alone suppose the one million and more of professed followers of christ should give a larger portion of their means for the social intellectual and moral wants of mankind than for the superfluities that minister to taste convenience and appetite it would be enough to furnish all the schools colleges bibles ministers and missionaries that the whole world could demand or at least it would be far more than properly qualified agents to administer it could employ but it may be objected that though this view is one which in the abstract looks plausible and rational not one in a thousand can practically adopt it how few keep any account at all of their current expenses how impossible it is to determine exactly what are necessaries and what are superfluities and in regard to women how few have the control of an income so as not to be bound by the wishes of a parent or a husband in reference to these difficulties the first remark is that we are never under obligations to do what is entirely out of our power so that those persons who have no power to regulate their expenses or their charities are under no sort of obligation to attempt it the second remark is that when a rule of duty is discovered we are bound to aim at it and to fulfil it just so far as we can we have no right to throw it aside because we shall find some difficult cases when we come to apply it the third remark is that no person can tell how much can be done till a faithful trial has been made if a woman has never kept any accounts nor attempted to regulate her expenditures by the right rule nor used her influence with those that control her plans to secure this object she has no right to say how much she can or cannot do till after a fair trial has been made in attempting such a trial the following method can be taken let a woman keep an account of all she spends for herself and her family for a year arranging the items under three general heads under the first put all articles for food raiment rent wages and all conveniences under the second place all sums paid in securing an education and books and other intellectual advantages under the third head place all that is spent for benevolence and religion at the end of the year the first and largest account will show the mixed items of necessaries and superfluities which can be arranged so as to gain some sort of idea how much has been spent for superfluities and how much for necessaries then by comparing what is spent for superfluities with what is spent for intellectual and moral advantages data will be gained for judging of the past and regulating the future does a woman say she cannot do this let her inquire whether the offer of a thousand dollars as a reward for attempting it one year would not make her undertake to do it and if so let her decide in her own mind which is most valuable a clear conscience and the approbation of god in this effort to do his will or one thousand dollars and let her do it with this warning of the saviour before her eyesno man can serve two masters ye cannot serve god and mammon is it objected how can we decide between superfluities and necessaries in this list it is replied that we are not required to judge exactly in all cases our duty is to use the means in our power to assist us in forming a correct judgement to seek the divine aid in freeing our minds from indolence and selfishness and then to judge as well as we can in our endeavors rightly to apportion and regulate our expenses many persons seem to feel that they are bound to do better than they know how but god is not so hard a master and after we have used all proper means to learn the right way if we then follow it according to our ability we do wrong to feel misgivings or to blame ourselves if results come out differently from what seems desirable the results of our actions alone can never prove us deserving of blame for men are often so placed that owing to lack of intellect or means it is impossible for them to decide correctly to use all the means of knowledge within our reach and then to judge with a candid and conscientious spirit is all that god requires and when we have done this and the event seems to come out wrong we should never wish that we had decided otherwise for it is the same as wishing that we had not followed the dictates of judgement and conscience as this is a world designed for discipline and trial untoward events are never to be construed as indications of the obliquity of our past decisions but it is probable that a great portion of the women of this nation cannot secure any such systematic mode of regulating their expenses to such the writer would propose one inquiry cannot you calculate how much time and money you spend for what is merely ornamental and not necessary for yourself your children and your house cannot you compare this with the time and money you spend for intellectual and benevolent purposes and will not this show the need of some change in making this examination is not this brief rule deducible from the principles before laid down the one which should regulate you every person does right in spending some portion of time and means in securing the conveniences and adornments of taste but the amount should never exceed what is spent in securing our own moral and intellectual improvement nor exceed what is spent in benevolent efforts to supply the physical and moral wants of our fellowmen in making an examination on this subject it is sometimes the case that a woman will count among the necessaries of life all the various modes of adorning the person or house practised in the circle in which she moves and after enumerating the many duties which demand attention counting these as a part she will come to the conclusion that she has no time and but little money to devote to personal improvement or to benevolent enterprises this surely is not in agreement with the requirements of the saviour who calls on us to seek for others as well as ourselves first of all the kingdom of god and his righteousness in order to act in accordance with the rule here presented it is true that many would be obliged to give up the idea of conforming to the notions and customs of those with whom they associate and compelled to adopt the maxim be not conformed to this world in many cases it would involve an entire change in the style of living and the writer has the happiness of knowing more cases than one where persons who have come to similar views on this subject have given up large and expensive establishments disposed of their carriages dismissed a portion of their domestics and modified all their expenditures that they might keep a pure conscience and regulate their charities more according to the requirements of christianity and there are persons well known in the religious world who save themselves all labor of minute calculation by devoting so large a portion of their time and means to benevolent objects that they find no difficulty in knowing that they give more for religious benevolent and intellectual purposes than for superfluities in deciding what particular objects shall receive our benefactions there are also general principles to guide us the first is that presented by our saviour when after urging the great law of benevolence he was asked and who is my neighbor his reply in the parable of the good samaritan teaches us that any human being whose wants are brought to our knowledge is our neighbor the wounded man was not only a stranger but he belonged to a foreign nation peculiarly hated and he had no claim except that his wants were brought to the knowledge of the wayfaring man from this we learn that the destitute of all nations become our neighbors as soon as their wants are brought to our knowledge another general principle is this that those who are most in need must be relieved in preference to those who are less destitute on this principle it is that we think the followers of christ should give more to supply those who are suffering for want of the bread of eternal life than for those who are deprived of physical enjoyments and another reason for this preference is the fact that many who give in charity have made such imperfect advances in civilization and christianity that the intellectual and moral wants of our race make but a feeble impression on the mind relate a pitiful tale of a family reduced to live for weeks on potatoes only and many a mind would awake to deep sympathy and stretch forth the hand of charity but describe cases where the immortal mind is pining in stupidity and ignorance or racked with the fever of baleful passions and how small the number so elevated in sentiment and so enlarged in their views as to appreciate and sympathize in these far greater misfortunes the intellectual and moral wants of our fellowmen therefore should claim the first place in our attention both because they are most important and because they are most neglected another consideration to be borne in mind is that in this country there is much less real need of charity in supplying physical necessities than is generally supposed by those who have not learned the more excellent way this land is so abundant in supplies and labor is in such demand that every healthy person can earn a comfortable support and if all the poor were instantly made virtuous it is probable that there would be no physical wants which could not readily be supplied by the immediate friends of each sufferer the sick the aged and the orphan would be the only objects of charity in this view of the case the primary effort in relieving the poor should be to furnish them the means of earning their own support and to supply them with those moral influences which are most effectual in securing virtue and industry another point to be attended to is the importance of maintaining a system of associated charities there is no point in which the economy of charity has more improved than in the present mode of combining many small contributions for sustaining enlarged and systematic plans of charity if all the halfdollars which are now contributed to aid in organized systems of charity were returned to the donors to be applied by the agency and discretion of each thousands and thousands of the treasures now employed to promote the moral and intellectual wants of mankind would become entirely useless in a democracy like ours where few are very rich and the majority are in comfortable circumstances this collecting and dispensing of drops and rills is the mode by which in imitation of nature the dews and showers are to distil on parched and desert lands and every person while earning a pittance to unite with many more may be cheered with the consciousness of sustaining a grand system of operations which must have the most decided influence in raising all mankind to that perfect state of society which christianity is designed to secure another consideration relates to the indiscriminate bestowal of charity persons who have taken pains to inform themselves and who devote their whole time to dispensing charities unite in declaring that this is one of the most fruitful sources of indolence vice and poverty from several of these the writer has learned that by their own personal investigations they have ascertained that there are large establishments of idle and wicked persons in most of our cities who associate together to support themselves by every species of imposition they hire large houses and live in constant rioting on the means thus obtained among them are women who have or who hire the use of infant children others who are blind or maimed or deformed or who can adroitly feign such infirmities and by these means of exciting pity and by artful tales of wo they collect alms both in city and country to spend in all manner of gross and guilty indulgences meantime many persons finding themselves often duped by impostors refuse to give at all and thus many benefactions are withdrawn which a wise economy in charity would have secured for this and other reasons it is wise and merciful to adopt the general rule never to give alms till we have had some opportunity of knowing how they will be spent there are exceptions to this as to every general rule which a person of discretion can determine but the practice so common among benevolent persons of giving at least a trifle to all who ask lest perchance they may turn away some who are really sufferers is one which causes more sin and misery than it cures the writer has never known any system for dispensing charity so successful as the one which in many places has been adopted in connection with the distribution of tracts by this method a town or city is divided into districts and each district is committed to the care of two ladies whose duty it is to call on each family and leave a tract and make that the occasion for entering into conversation and learning the situation of all residents in the district by this method the ignorant the vicious and the poor are discovered and their physical intellectual and moral wants are investigated in some places where the writer has resided or visited each person retained the same district year after year so that every poor family in the place was under the watch and care of some intelligent and benevolent lady who used all her influence to secure a proper education for the children to furnish them with suitable reading to encourage habits of industry and economy and to secure regular attendance on public religious instruction thus the rich and the poor were brought in contact in a way advantageous to both parties and if such a system could be universally adopted more would be done for the prevention of poverty and vice than all the wealth of the nation could avail for their relief but this plan cannot be successfully carried out in this manner unless there is a large proportion of intelligent benevolent and selfdenying persons and the mere distribution of tracts without the other parts of the plan is of very little avail but there is one species of charity which needs especial consideration it is that which induces us to refrain from judging of the means and the relative charities of other persons there have been such indistinct notions and so many different standards of duty on this subject that it is rare for two persons to think exactly alike in regard to the rule of duty each person is bound to inquire and judge for himself as to his own duty or deficiencies but as both the resources and the amount of the actual charities of other men are beyond our ken it is as indecorous as it is uncharitable to sit in judgement on their decisions chapter xvi on economy of time and expenses on economy of time the value of time and our obligation to spend every hour for some useful end are what few minds properly realize and those who have the highest sense of their obligations in this respect sometimes greatly misjudge in their estimate of what are useful and proper modes of employing time this arises from limited views of the importance of some pursuits which they would deem frivolous and useless but which are in reality necessary to preserve the health of body and mind and those social affections which it is very important to cherish christianity teaches that for all the time afforded us we must give account to god and that we have no right to waste a single hour but time which is spent in rest or amusement is often as usefully employed as if it were devoted to labor or devotion in employing our time we are to make suitable allowance for sleep for preparing and taking food for securing the means of a livelihood for intellectual improvement for exercise and amusement for social enjoyments and for benevolent and religious duties and it is the right apportionment of time to these various duties which constitutes its true economy in making this apportionment we are bound by the same rules as relate to the use of property we are to employ whatever portion is necessary to sustain life and health as the first duty and the remainder we are so to apportion that our highest interests shall receive the greatest allotment and our physical gratifications the least the laws of the supreme ruler when he became the civil as well as the religious head of the jewish theocracy furnish an example which it would be well for all attentively to consider when forming plans for the apportionment of time and property to properly estimate this example it must be borne in mind that the main object of god was to preserve his religion among the jewish nation and that they were not required to take any means to propagate it among other nations as christians are now required to extend christianity so low were they in the scale of civilization and mental developement that a system which confined them to one spot as an agricultural people and prevented their growing very rich or having extensive commerce with other nations was indispensable to prevent their relapsing into the low idolatries and vices of the nations around them the proportion of time and property which every jew was required to devote to intellectual benevolent and religious purposes was as follows in regard to property they were required to give one tenth of all their yearly income to support the levites the priests and the religious service next they were required to give the first fruits of all their corn wine oil and fruits and the firstborn of all their cattle for the lords treasury to be employed for the priests the widow the fatherless and the stranger the firstborn also of their children were the lords and were to be redeemed by a specified sum paid into the sacred treasury besides this they were required to bring a freewill offering to god every time they went up to the three great yearly festivals in addition to this regular yearly sacrifices of cattle and fowls were required of each family and occasional sacrifices for certain sins or ceremonial impurities in reaping their fields they were required to leave unreaped for the poor the corners not to glean their fields oliveyards or vineyards and if a sheaf was left by mistake they were not to return for it but leave it for the poor when a man sent away a servant he was thus charged furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress when a poor man came to borrow money they were forbidden to deny him or to take any interest and if at the sabbatical or seventh year he could not pay the debt was to be cancelled and to this command is added the significant caution beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee thou shalt surely give him because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto besides this the levites were distributed through the land with the intention that they should be instructors and priests in every part of the nation thus one twelfth of the people were set apart having no landed property to be priests and teachers and the other tribes were required to support them liberally in regard to the time taken from secular pursuits for the support of religion an equally liberal amount was demanded in the first place one seventh part of their time was taken for the weekly sabbath when no kind of work was to be done then the whole nation were required to meet at the appointed place three times a year which including their journeys and stay there occupied eight weeks or another seventh part of their time then the sabbatical year when no agricultural labor was to be done took another seventh of their time from their regular pursuits as they were an agricultural people this was the amount of time and property demanded by god simply to sustain religion and morality within the bounds of that nation christianity demands the spread of its blessings to all mankind and so the restrictions laid on the jews are withheld and all our wealth and time not needful for our own best interest is to be employed in improving the condition of our fellowmen in deciding respecting the rectitude of our pursuits we are bound to aim at some practical good as the ultimate object with every duty of this life our benevolent creator has connected some species of enjoyment to draw us to perform it thus the palate is gratified by performing the duty of nourishing our bodies the principle of curiosity is gratified in pursuing useful knowledge the desire of approbation is gratified when we perform benevolent and social duties and every other duty has an alluring enjoyment connected with it but the great mistake of mankind has consisted in seeking the pleasures connected with these duties as the sole aim without reference to the main end that should be held in view and to which the enjoyment should be made subservient thus men seek to gratify the palate without reference to the question whether the body is properly nourished and follow after knowledge without inquiring whether it ministers to good or evil but in gratifying the implanted desires of our nature we are bound so to restrain ourselves by reason and conscience as always to seek the main objects of existencethe highest good of ourselves and others and never to sacrifice this for the mere gratification of our sensual desires we are to gratify appetite just so far as is consistent with health and usefulness and the desire for knowledge just so far as will enable us to do most good by our influence and efforts and no farther we are to seek social intercourse to that extent which will best promote domestic enjoyment and kindly feelings among neighbors and friends and we are to pursue exercise and amusement only so far as will best sustain the vigor of body and mind for the right apportionment of time to these and various other duties we are to give an account to our creator and final judge instead of attempting to give any very specific rules on this subject some modes of economizing time will be suggested the most powerful of all agencies in this matter is that habit of system and order in all our pursuits which has been already pointed out it is probable that a regular and systematic employment of time will enable a person to accomplish thrice the amount of labor that could otherwise be performed another mode of economizing time is by uniting several objects in one employment thus exercise or charitable efforts can be united with social enjoyments as is done in associations for sewing or visiting the poor instruction and amusement can also be combined pursuits like music gardening drawing botany and the like unite intellectual improvement with amusement social enjoyment and exercise with housekeepers and others whose employments are various and desultory much time can be saved by preparing employments for little intervals of leisure thus some ladies make ready and keep in the parlor light work to take up when detained there some keep a book at hand in the nursery to read while holding or sitting by a sleeping infant one of the most popular female poets of our country very often shows her friends at their calls that the thread of the knitting never need interfere with the thread of agreeable discourse it would be astonishing to one who had never tried the experiment how much can be accomplished by a little planning and forethought in thus finding employment for odd intervals of time but besides economizing our own time we are bound to use our influence and example to promote the discharge of the same duty by others a woman is under obligations so to arrange the hours and pursuits of her family as to promote systematic and habitual industry and if by late breakfasts irregular hours for meals and other hinderances of this kind she interferes with or refrains from promoting regular industry in others she is accountable to god for all the waste of time consequent on her negligence the mere example of system and industry in a housekeeper has a wonderful influence in promoting the same virtuous habit in others on economy in expenses it is impossible for a woman to practise a wise economy in expenditures unless she is taught how to do it either by a course of experiments or by the instruction of those who have had experience it is amusing to notice the various and oftentimes contradictory notions of economy among judicious and experienced housekeepers for there is probably no economist who would not be deemed lavish or wasteful in some respects by another and equally experienced and judicious person who in some different points would herself be as much condemned by the other these diversities are occasioned by dissimilar early habits and by the different relative value assigned by each to the various modes of enjoyment for which money is expended but though there may be much disagreement in minor matters there are certain general principles which all unite in sanctioning the first is that care be taken to know the amount of income and of current expenses so that the proper relative proportion be preserved and the expenditures never exceed the means few women can do this thoroughly without keeping regular accounts the habits of this nation especially among businessmen are so desultory and the current expenses of a family in many points are so much more under the control of the man than of the woman that many women who are disposed to be systematic in this matter cannot follow their wishes but there are often cases when much is left undone in this particular simply because no effort is made yet every woman is bound to do as much as is in her power to accomplish a systematic mode of expenditure and the regulation of it by christian principles the following are examples of different methods which have been adopted for securing a proper adjustment of expenses to the means the first is that of a lady who kept a large boardinghouse in one of our cities every evening before retiring she took an account of the expenses of the day and this usually occupied her not more than fifteen minutes at a time on each saturday she made an inventory of the stores on hand and of the daily expenses and also of what was due to her and then made an exact estimate of her expenditures and profits this after the first two or three weeks never took more than an hour at the close of the week thus by a very little time regularly devoted to this object she knew accurately her income expenditures and profits another friend of the writer lives on a regular salary the method adopted in this case is to calculate to what the salary amounts each week then an account is kept of what is paid out each week for rent fuel wages and food this amount of each week is deducted from the weekly income the remainders of each week are added at the close of a month as the stock from which is to be taken the dress furniture books travelling expenses charities and all other expenditures another lady whose husband is a lawyer divides the year into four quarters and the income into four equal parts she then makes her plans so that the expenses of one quarter shall never infringe on the income of another so resolute is she in carrying out this determination that if by any mischance she is in want of articles before the close of a quarter which she has not the means for providing she will subject herself to temporary inconvenience by waiting rather than violate her rule another lady whose husband is engaged in a business which he thinks makes it impossible for him to know what his yearly income will be took this methodshe kept an account of all her disbursements for one year this she submitted to her husband and obtained his consent that the same sum should be under her control the coming year for similar purposes with the understanding that she might modify future apportionments in any way her judgement and conscience might approve a great deal of uneasiness and discomfort is caused to both husband and wife in many cases by an entire want of system and forethought in arranging expenses both keep buying what they think they need without any calculation as to how matters are coming out and with a sort of dread of running in debt all the time harassing them such never know the comfort of independence but if a man or woman will only calculate what their income is and then plan so as to know that they are all the time living within it they secure one of the greatest comforts which wealth ever bestows and what many of the rich who live in a loose and careless way never enjoy it is not so much the amount of income as the regular and correct apportionment of expenses that makes a family truly comfortable a man with ten thousand a year is often more harassed for want of money than the systematic economist who supports a family on only six hundred a year and the inspired command owe no man any thing can never be conscientiously observed without a systematic adaptation of expenses to means as it is very important that young ladies should learn systematic economy in expenses it will be a great benefit for every young girl to begin at twelve or thirteen years of age to make her own purchases and keep her accounts under the guidance of her mother or some other friend and if parents would ascertain the actual expense of a daughters clothing for a year and give the sum to her in quarterly payments requiring a regular account it would be of great benefit in preparing her for future duties how else are young ladies to learn to make purchases properly and to be systematic and economical the art of system and economy can no more come by intuition than the art of watchmaking or bookkeeping and how strange it appears that so many young ladies take charge of a husbands establishment without having had either instruction or experience in one of the most important duties of their station the second general principle of economy is that in apportioning an income among various objects the most important should receive the largest supply and that all retrenchments be made in matters of less importance in a previous chapter some general principles have been presented to guide in this duty some additional hints will here be added on the same topic in regard to dress and furniture much want of judgement and good taste is often seen in purchasing some expensive article which is not at all in keeping with the other articles connected with it thus a large sideboard or elegant mirror or sofa which would be suitable only for a large establishment with other rich furniture is crowded into too small a room with coarse and cheap articles around it so also sometimes a parlor and companychamber will be furnished in a style suitable only for the wealthy while the table will be supplied with shabby linen and imperfect crockery and every other part of the house will look in comparison with these fine rooms mean and niggardly it is not at all uncommon to find very showy and expensive articles in the part of the house visible to strangers when the childrens rooms kitchen and other back portions are on an entirely different scale so in regard to dress a lady will sometimes purchase an elegant and expensive article which instead of attracting admiration from the eye of taste will merely serve as a decoy to the painful contrast of all other parts of the dress a woman of real good taste and discretion will strive to maintain a relative consistency between all departments and not in one quarter live on a scale fitted only to the rich and in another on one appropriate only to the poor another mistake in economy is often made by some of the besteducated and most intelligent of mothers such will often be found spending day after day at needlework when with a comparatively small sum this labor could be obtained of those who need the money which such work would procure for them meantime the daughters of the family whom the mother is qualified to educate or so nearly qualified that she could readily keep ahead of her children are sent to expensive boardingschools where their delicate frames their pliant minds and their moral and religious interests are relinquished to the hands of strangers and the expense thus incurred would serve to pay the hire of every thing the mother can do in sewing four or five times over the same want of economy is shown in communities where instead of establishing a good female school in their vicinity the men of wealth send their daughters abroad at double the expense to be either educated or spoiled as the case may be another species of poor economy is manifested in neglecting to acquire and apply mechanical skill which in consequence has to be hired from others thus all the plain sewing will be done by the mother and daughters while all that requires skill will be hired instead of this others take pains to have their daughters instructed in mantuamaking and the simpler parts of millinery so that the plain work is given to the poor who need it and the more expensive and tasteful operations are performed in the family the writer knows ladies who not only make their own dresses but also their caps bonnets and artificial flowers some persons make miscalculations in economy by habitually looking up cheap articles while others go to the opposite extreme and always buy the best of every thing those ladies who are considered the best economists do not adopt either method in regard to cheap goods the fading colors the damages discovered in use the poorness of material and the extra sewing demanded to replace articles lost by such causes usually render them very dear in the end on the other hand though some articles of the most expensive kind wear longest and best yet as a general rule articles at medium prices do the best service this is true of table and bed linens broadcloths shirtings and the like though even in these cases it is often found that the coarsest and cheapest last the longest buying by wholesale and keeping a large supply on hand are economical only in large families where the mistress is careful but in other cases the hazards of accident and the temptation to a lavish use will make the loss outrun the profits there is one mode of economizing which it is hoped will every year grow more rare and that is making penurious savings by getting the poor to work as cheap as possible many amiable and benevolent women have done this on principle without reflecting on the want of christian charity thus displayed let every woman in making bargains with the poor conceive herself placed in the same circumstances toiling hour after hour and day after day for a small sum and then deal with others as she would be dealt by in such a situation liberal prices and prompt payment should be an invariable maxim in dealing with the poor the third general principle of economy is that all articles should be so used and taken care of as to secure the longest service with the least waste under this head come many particulars in regard to the use and preservation of articles which will be found more in detail in succeeding chapters it may be proper however here to refer to one very common impression as to the relative obligation of the poor and the rich in regard to economy many seem to suppose that those who are wealthy have a right to be lavish and negligent in the care of expenses but this surely is a great mistake property is a talent given by god to spend for the welfare of mankind and the needless waste of it is as wrong in the rich as it is in the poor the rich are under obligations to apportion their income to the various objects demanding attention by the same rule as all others and if this will allow them to spend more for superfluities than those of smaller means it never makes it right to misuse or waste any of the bounties of providence whatever is no longer wanted for their own enjoyment should be carefully saved to add to the enjoyment of others it is not always that men understand the economy of providence in that unequal distribution of property which even under the most perfect form of government will always exist many looking at the present state of things imagine that the rich if they acted in strict conformity to the law of benevolence would share all their property with their suffering fellowmen but such do not take into account the inspired declaration that a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth or in other words life is made valuable not by great possessions but by such a character as prepares a man to enjoy what he holds god perceives that human character can be most improved by that kind of discipline which exists when there is something valuable to be gained by industrious efforts this stimulus to industry could never exist in a community where all are just alike as it does in a state of society where every man sees possessed by others enjoyments which he desires and may secure by effort and industry so in a community where all are alike as to property there would be no chance to gain that noblest of all attainments a habit of selfdenying benevolence which toils for the good of others and takes from ones own store to increase the enjoyments of another instead then of the stagnation both of industry and of benevolence which would follow the universal and equable distribution of property one class of men by superior advantages of birth or intellect or patronage come into possession of a great amount of capital with these means they are enabled by study reading and travel to secure expansion of mind and just views of the relative advantages of moral intellectual and physical enjoyments at the same time christianity imposes obligations corresponding with the increase of advantages and means the rich are not at liberty to spend their treasures for themselves alone their wealth is given by god to be employed for the best good of mankind and their intellectual advantages are designed primarily to enable them to judge correctly in employing their means most wisely for the general good now suppose a man of wealth inherits ten thousand acres of real estate it is not his duty to divide it among his poor neighbors and tenants if he took this course it is probable that most of them would spend all in thriftless waste and indolence or in mere physical enjoyments instead then of thus putting his capital out of his hands he is bound to retain and so to employ it as to raise his neighbors and tenants to such a state of virtue and intelligence that they can secure far more by their own efforts and industry than he by dividing his capital could bestow upon them in this view of the subject it is manifest that the unequal distribution of property is no evil the great difficulty is that so large a portion of those who hold much capital instead of using their various advantages for the greatest good of those around them employ the chief of them for mere selfish indulgences thus inflicting as much mischief on themselves as results to others from their culpable neglect a great portion of the rich seem to be acting on the principle that the more god bestows on them the less are they under obligation to practise any selfdenial in fulfilling his benevolent plan of raising our race to intelligence and holiness there are not a few who seem to imagine that it is a mark of gentility to be careless of expenses but this notion is owing to a want of knowledge of the world as a general fact it will be found that persons of rank and wealth abroad are much more likely to be systematic and economical than persons of inferior standing in these respects even the most frivolous among the rich and great are often found practising a rigid economy in certain respects in order to secure gratifications in another direction and it will be found so common among persons of vulgar minds and little education and less sense to make a display of profusion and indifference to expense as a mark of their claims to gentility that the really genteel look upon it rather as a mark of low breeding so that the sort of feeling which some persons cherish as if it were a degradation to be careful of small sums and to be attentive to relative prices in making purchases is founded on mistaken notions of gentility and propriety but one caution is needful in regard to another extreme when a lady of wealth is seen roaming about in search of cheaper articles or trying to beat down a shopkeeper or making a close bargain with those she employs the impropriety is glaring to all minds a person of wealth has no occasion to spend time in looking for extra cheap articles her time could be more profitably employed in distributing to the wants of others and the practice of beating down tradespeople is vulgar and degrading in any one a woman after a little inquiry can ascertain what is the fair and common price of things and if she is charged an exorbitant sum she can decline taking the article if the price be a fair one it is not becoming in her to search for another article which is below the regular charge if a woman finds that she is in a store where they charge high prices expecting to be beat down she can mention that she wishes to know the lowest price as it is contrary to her principles to beat down charges there is one inconsistency worthy of notice which is found among that class who are ambitious of being ranked among the aristocracy of society it has been remarked that in the real aristocracy of other lands it is much more common than with us to practise systematic economy and such do not hesitate to say so when they cannot afford certain indulgences this practice descends to subordinate grades so that foreign ladies when they come to reside among us seldom hesitate in assigning the true reason when they cannot afford any gratification but in this country it will be found that many who are most fond of copying aristocratic examples are on this point rather with the vulgar not a few of those young persons who begin life with parlors and dresses in a style fitting only to established wealth go into expenses which they can ill afford and are ashamed even to allow that they are restrained from any expense by motives of economy such a confession is never extorted except by some call of benevolence and then they are very ready to declare that they cannot afford to bestow even a pittance in such cases it would seem as if the direct opposite of christianity had gained possession of their tastes and opinions they are ashamed to appear to deny themselves but are very far from having any shame in denying the calls of benevolence chapter xvii on health of mind there is such an intimate connection between the body and mind that the health of one cannot be preserved without a proper care of the other and it is from a neglect of this principle that some of the most exemplary and conscientious persons in the world suffer a thousand mental agonies from a diseased state of body while others ruin the health of the body by neglecting the proper care of the mind when the brain is excited by stimulating drinks taken into the stomach it produces a corresponding excitement of the mental faculties the reason the imagination and all the powers are stimulated to preternatural vigor and activity in like manner when the mind is excited by earnest intellectual effort or by strong passions the brain is equally excited and the blood rushes to the head sir astley cooper records that in examining the brain of a young man who had lost a portion of his skull whenever he was agitated by some opposition to his wishes the blood was sent with increased force to his brain and the pulsations became frequent and violent the same effect was produced by any intellectual effort and the flushed countenance which attends earnest study or strong emotions of fear shame or anger is an external indication of the suffused state of the brain from such causes in exhibiting the causes which injure the health of the mind they will be found to be partly physical partly intellectual and partly moral the first cause of mental disease and suffering is not unfrequently found in the want of a proper supply of duly oxygenized blood it has been shown that the blood in passing through the lungs is purified by the oxygen of the air combining with the superabundant hydrogen and carbon of the venous blood thus forming carbonic acid and water which are expired into the atmosphere every pair of lungs is constantly withdrawing from the surrounding atmosphere its healthful principle and returning one which is injurious to human life when by confinement and this process the atmosphere is deprived of its appropriate supply of oxygen the purification of the blood is interrupted and it passes without being properly prepared into the brain producing languor restlessness and inability to exercise the intellect and feelings whenever therefore persons sleep in a close apartment or remain for a length of time in a crowded or illventilated room a most pernicious influence is exerted on the brain and through this on the mind a person who is often exposed to such influences can never enjoy that elasticity and vigor of mind which is one of the chief indications of its health this is the reason why all rooms for religious meetings and all schoolrooms and sleeping apartments should be so contrived as to secure a constant supply of fresh air from without the minister who preaches in a crowded and illventilated apartment loses much of his power to feel and to speak while the audience are equally reduced in their capability of attending the teacher who confines children in a close apartment diminishes their ability to study or to attend to his instructions and the person who habitually sleeps in a close room impairs his mental energies in a similar degree it is not unfrequently the case that depression of spirits and stupor of intellect are occasioned solely by inattention to this subject another cause of mental disease is the excessive exercise of the intellect or feelings if the eye is taxed beyond its strength by protracted use its bloodvessels become gorged and the bloodshot appearance warns of the excess and the need of rest the brain is affected in a similar manner by excessive use though the suffering and inflamed organ cannot make its appeal to the eye but there are some indications which ought never to be misunderstood or disregarded in cases of pupils at school or at college a diseased state from over action is often manifested by increased clearness of mind and ease and vigor of mental action in one instance known to the writer a most exemplary and industrious pupil anxious to improve every hour and ignorant or unmindful of the laws of health first manifested the diseased state of her brain and mind by demands for more studies and a sudden and earnest activity in planning modes of improvement for herself and others when warned of her danger she protested that she never was better in her life that she took regular exercise in the open air went to bed in season slept soundly and felt perfectly well that her mind was never before so bright and clear and study never so easy and delightful and at this time she was on the verge of derangement from which she was saved only by an entire cessation of all her intellectual efforts a similar case occurred under the eye of the writer from overexcited feelings it was during a time of unusual religious interest in the community and the mental disease was first manifested by the pupil bringing her hymnbook or bible to the classroom and making it her constant resort in every interval of school duty it finally became impossible to convince her that it was her duty to attend to any thing else her conscience became morbidly sensitive her perceptions indistinct her deductions unreasonable and nothing but entire change of scene exercise and amusement saved her when the health of the brain was restored she found that she could attend to the one thing needful not only without interruption of duty or injury of health but rather so as to promote both clergymen and teachers need most carefully to notice and guard against the danger here alluded to any such attention to religion as prevents the performance of daily duties and needful relaxation is dangerous as tending to produce such a state of the brain as makes it impossible to feel or judge correctly and when any morbid and unreasonable pertinacity appears much exercise and engagement in other interesting pursuits should be urged as the only mode of securing the religious benefits aimed at and whenever any mind is oppressed with care anxiety or sorrow the amount of active exercise in the fresh air should be greatly increased that the action of the muscles may withdraw the blood which in such seasons is constantly tending too much to the brain there has been a most appalling amount of suffering derangement disease and death occasioned by a want of attention to this subject in teachers and parents uncommon precocity in children is usually the result of an unhealthy state of the brain and in such cases medical men would now direct that the wonderful child should be deprived of all books and study and turned to play or work in the fresh air instead of this parents frequently add fuel to the fever of the brain by supplying constant mental stimulus until the victim finds refuge in idiocy or an early grave where such fatal results do not occur the brain in many cases is so weakened that the prodigy of infancy sinks below the medium of intellectual powers in afterlife in our colleges too many of the most promising minds sink to an early grave or drag out a miserable existence from this same cause and it is an evil as yet little alleviated by the increase of physiological knowledge every college and professional school and every seminary for young ladies needs a medical man not only to lecture on physiology and the laws of health but empowered in his official capacity to investigate the case of every pupil and by authority to restrain him to such a course of study exercise and repose as his physical system requires the writer has found by experience that in a large institution there is one class of pupils who need to be restrained by penalties from late hours and excessive study as much as another class need stimulus to industry under the head of excessive mental action must be placed the indulgence of the imagination in novel reading and castle building this kind of stimulus unless counterbalanced by physical exercise not only wastes time and energies but undermines the vigor of the nervous system the imagination was designed by our kind creator as the charm and stimulus to animate to benevolent activity and its perverted exercise seldom fails to bring the appropriate penalty a third cause of mental disease is the want of the appropriate exercise of the various faculties of the mind on this point dr combe remarks we have seen that by disuse muscle becomes emaciated bone softens bloodvessels are obliterated and nerves lose their characteristic structure the brain is no exception to this general rule of it also the tone is impaired by permanent inactivity and it becomes less fit to manifest the mental powers with readiness and energy it is the withdrawal of the stimulus necessary for its healthy exercise which renders solitary confinement so severe a punishment even to the most daring minds it is a lower degree of the same cause which renders continuous seclusion from society so injurious to both mental and bodily health inactivity of intellect and of feeling is a very frequent predisposing cause of every form of nervous disease for demonstrative evidence of this position we have only to look at the numerous victims to be found among persons who have no call to exertion in gaining the means of subsistence and no objects of interest on which to exercise their mental faculties and who consequently sink into a state of mental sloth and nervous weakness if we look abroad upon society we shall find innumerable examples of mental and nervous debility from this cause when a person of some mental capacity is confined for a long time to an unvarying round of employment which affords neither scope nor stimulus for one half of his faculties and from want of education or society has no external resources his mental powers for want of exercise become blunted and his perceptions slow and dull the intellect and feelings not being provided with interests external to themselves must either become inactive and weak or work upon themselves and become diseased the most frequent victims of this kind of predisposition are females of the middle and higher ranks especially those of a nervous constitution and good natural abilities but who from an illdirected education possess nothing more solid than mere accomplishments and have no materials of thought and no occupation to excite interest or demand attention the liability of such persons to melancholy hysteria hypochondriasis and other varieties of mental distress really depends on a state of irritability of brain induced by imperfect exercise these remarks of a medical man illustrate the principles before indicatednamely that the demand of christianity that we live to promote the general happiness and not merely for selfish indulgence has for its aim not only the general good but the highest happiness of the individual of whom it is required a person possessed of wealth who has nothing more noble to engage his attention than seeking his own personal enjoyment subjects his mental powers and moral feelings to a degree of inactivity utterly at war with health of mind and the greater the capacities the greater are the sufferings which result from this cause any one who has read the misanthropic wailings of lord byron has seen the necessary result of great and noble powers bereft of their appropriate exercise and in consequence becoming sources of the keenest suffering it is this view of the subject which has often awakened feelings of sorrow and anxiety in the mind of the writer while aiding in the developement and education of superior female minds in the wealthier circles not because there are not noble objects for interest and effort abundant and within reach of such minds but because longestablished custom has made it seem so quixotic to the majority even of the professed followers of christ for a woman of wealth to practise any great selfdenial that few have independence of mind and christian principle sufficient to overcome such an influence the more a mind has its powers developed the more does it aspire and pine after some object worthy of its energies and affections and they are commonplace and phlegmatic characters who are most free from such deepseated wants many a young woman of fine genius and elevated sentiment finds a charm in lord byrons writings because they present a glowing picture of what to a certain extent must be felt by every welldeveloped mind which has no nobler object in life than the pursuit of its own gratification if young ladies of wealth could pursue their education under the full conviction that the increase of their powers and advantages increased their obligations to use all for the good of society and with some plan of benevolent enterprise in view what new motives of interest would be added to their daily pursuits and what blessed results would follow to our beloved country if all welleducated females carried out the principles of christianity in the exercise of their developed powers it is cheering to know that there are women among the most intelligent and wealthy who can be presented as examples of what may be done when there is a heart to do a pupil of the writer is among this number who though a rich heiress immediately on the close of her schoollife commenced a course of selfdenying benevolence in the cause of education she determined to secure a superior female institution in her native place which should extend the benefits of the best education to all in that vicinity at a moderate charge finding no teacher on the ground prepared to take the lead and though herself a timid and retiring character she began with the aid of the governess in her mothers family a daily school superintending all and teaching six hours a day the liberalminded and intelligent mother cooperated and the result is a flourishing female seminary with a large and beautiful and wellfurnished building the greater part of the means being supplied by the mother and almost all by the members of that family connection and both these ladies will testify that no time or money spent for any other object has ever secured to them more real and abiding enjoyment than witnessing the results of this successful and benevolent enterprise which for years to come will pour forth blessings on society another lady could be pointed out who possessing some property went into a new western village built and furnished her schoolhouse and established herself there to aid in raising a community from ignorance and gross worldliness to intelligence and virtue and in repeated instances among the friends and pupils of the writer young ladies have left wealthy homes and affectionate friends to find nobler enjoyments in benevolent and active exertions to extend intelligence and virtue where such disinterested laborers were needed in other cases where it was not practicable to leave home welleducated young ladies have interested themselves in common schools in the vicinity aiding the teachers by their sympathy counsel and personal assistance other ladies of property and standing having families to educate and being well qualified for such duties have relinquished a large portion of domestic labor and superintendence which humbler minds could be hired to perform devoted themselves to the education of their children and received others less fortunate to share with their own these superior advantages but so long as the feeling widely exists that the increase of gods bounties diminishes the obligations of selfdenying service for the good of mankind so long will welleducated women in easy circumstances shrink from such confinement and exertion it is believed however that there are many benevolent and intelligent women in this country who would gladly engage in such enterprises were there any appropriate way within their reach and it is a question well deserving consideration among those who guide the public mind in benevolent enterprises whether some organization is not demanded which shall bring the whole community to act systematically in voluntary associations to extend a proper education to every child in this nation and to bring into activity all the female enterprise and benevolence now lying dormant for want of proper facilities to exercise them there are hundreds of villages which need teachers and that would support them if they were on the spot but which never will send for them and there are hundreds of females now unemployed who would teach if a proper place and home and support and escort were provided for them and there needs to be some enlarged and systematic plan conducted by wise and efficient men to secure these objects could such a plan as the one suggested be carried out it is believed that many female minds now suffering from diseases occasioned by want of appropriate objects for their energies would be relieved the duties of a teacher exercise every intellectual faculty to its full extent while in this benevolent service all the social moral and benevolent emotions are kept in full play the happiest persons the writer has ever knownthose who could say that they were as happy as they wished to be in this world and she has seen suchwere persons engaged in this employment the indications of a diseased mind owing to a want of the proper exercise of its powers are apathy discontent a restless longing for excitement a craving for unattainable good a diseased and morbid action of the imagination dissatisfaction with the world and factitious interest in trifles which the mind feels to be unworthy of its powers such minds sometimes seek alleviation in exciting amusements others resort to the grosser enjoyments of sense oppressed with the extremes of languor or overexcitement or apathy the body fails under the wearing process and adds new causes of suffering to the mind such the compassionate saviour calls to his service in these appropriate terms come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me and ye shall find rest unto your souls chapter xviii on the care of domestics there is no point where the women of this country need more wisdom patience principle and selfcontrol than in relation to those whom they employ in domestic service the subject is attended with many difficulties which powerfully influence the happiness of families and the following suggestions are offered to aid in securing right opinions and practice one consideration which it would be well to bear in mind on this subject is that a large portion of the peculiar trials which american women suffer from this source are the necessary evils connected with our most valuable civil blessings every blessing of this life involves some attendant liability to evil from the same source and in this case while we rejoice at a state of society which so much raises the condition and advantages of our sex the evils involved should be regarded as more than repaid by the compensating benefits if we cannot secure the cringing submissive welltrained servants of aristocratic lands let us be consoled that we thus escape from the untold miseries and oppression which always attend that state of society instead then of complaining that we cannot have our own peculiar advantages and those of other nations too or imagining how much better off we should be if things were different from what they are it is much wiser and more christianlike to strive cheerfully to conform to actual circumstances and after remedying all that we can control patiently to submit to what is beyond our power if domestics are found to be incompetent unstable and unconformed to their station it is perfect wisdom which appoints these trials to teach us patience fortitude and selfcontrol and if the discipline is met in a proper spirit it will prove a blessing rather than an evil but to judge correctly in regard to some of the evils involved in the state of domestic service in this country we should endeavor to conceive ourselves placed in the situation of those of whom complaint is made that we may not expect from them any more than it would seem right should be exacted from us in similar circumstances it is sometimes urged against domestics that they exact exorbitant wages but what is the rule of rectitude on this subject is it not the universal law of labor and of trade that an article is to be valued according to its scarcity and the demand when wheat is scarce the farmer raises his price and when a mechanic offers services difficult to be obtained he makes a corresponding increase of price and why is it not right for domestics to act according to a rule allowed to be correct in reference to all other trades and professions it is a fact that really good domestic service must continue to increase in value just in proportion as this country waxes rich and prosperous thus making the proportion of those who wish to hire labor relatively greater and the number of those willing to go to service less money enables the rich to gain many advantages which those of more limited circumstances cannot secure one of these is securing good domestics by offering high wages and this as the scarcity of this class increases will serve constantly to raise the price of service it is right for domestics to charge the market value and this value is always decided by the scarcity of the article and the amount of demand right views of this subject will sometimes serve to diminish hard feelings towards those who would otherwise be wrongfully regarded as unreasonable and exacting another complaint against domestics is that of instability and discontent leading to perpetual change but in reference to this let a mother or daughter conceive of their own circumstances as so changed that the daughter must go out to service suppose a place is engaged and it is then found that she must sleep in a comfortless garret and that when a new domestic comes perhaps a coarse and dirty foreigner she must share her bed with her another place is offered where she can have a comfortable room and an agreeable roommate in such a case would not both mother and daughter think it right to change or suppose on trial it was found that the lady of the house was fretful or exacting and hard to please or that her children were so ungoverned as to be perpetual vexations or that the work was so heavy that no time was allowed for relaxation and the care of a wardrobeand another place offers where these evils can be escaped would not mother and daughter here think it right to change and is it not right for domestics as well as their employers to seek places where they can be most comfortable in some cases this instability and love of change would be remedied if employers would take more pains to make a residence with them agreeable and to attach domestics to the family by feelings of gratitude and affection there are ladies even where wellqualified domestics are most rare who seldom find any trouble in keeping good and steady ones and the reason is that their domestics know they cannot better their condition by any change within reach it is not merely by giving them comfortable rooms and good food and presents and privileges that the attachment of domestics is secured it is by the manifestation of a friendly and benevolent interest in their comfort and improvement this is exhibited in bearing patiently with their faults in kindly teaching them how to improve in showing them how to make and take proper care of their clothes in guarding their health in teaching them to read if necessary and supplying them with proper books and in short by endeavoring so far as may be to supply the place of parents it is seldom that such a course would fail to secure steady service and such affection and gratitude that even higher wages would be ineffectual to tempt them away there would probably be some cases of ungrateful returns but there is no doubt that the course indicated if generally pursued would very much lessen the evil in question another subject of complaint in regard to domestics is their pride insubordination and spirit not conformed to their condition they are not willing to be called servants in some places they claim a seat at meals with the family they imitate a style of dress unbecoming their condition and their manners and address are rude and disrespectful that these evils are very common among this class of persons cannot be denied the only question is how can they best be met and remedied in regard to the common feeling among domestics which is pained and offended by being called servants there is need of some consideration and allowance it should be remembered that in this country children from their earliest years are trained to abhor slavery in reference to themselves as the greatest of all possible shame and degradation they are perpetually hearing orations songs and compositions of all sorts which set forth the honor and dignity of freemen and heap scorn and contempt on all who would be so mean as to be slaves now the term servant and the duties it involves are in the minds of many persons nearly the same as those of slave and there are few minds entirely free from associations which make servitude a degradation it is not always pride then which makes this term so offensive it is a consequence of that noble and generous spirit of freedom which every american draws from his mothers breast and which ought to be respected rather than despised in order to be respected by others we must respect ourselves and sometimes the ruder classes of society make claims deemed forward and offensive when with their views such a position seems indispensable to preserve a proper selfrespect where an excessive sensibility on this subject exists and forward and disrespectful manners result from it the best remedy is a kind attempt to give correct views such as bettereducated minds are best able to attain it should be shown to them that in this country labor has ceased to be degrading in any class that in all classes different grades of subordination must exist and that it is no more degrading for a domestic to regard the heads of a family as superiors in station and treat them with becoming respect than it is for children to do the same or for men to treat their rulers with respect and deference they should be taught that domestics use a different entrance to the house and sit at a distinct table not because they are inferior beings but because this is the best method of securing neatness order and convenience they can be shown if it is attempted in a proper spirit and manner that these very regulations really tend to their own ease and comfort as well as to that of the family the writer has known a case where the lady of the family for the sake of convincing her domestic of the truth of these views allowed her to follow her own notions for a short time and join the family at meals it was merely required as a condition that she should always dress her hair as the other ladies did and appear in a clean dress and abide by all the rules of propriety at table which the rest were required to practise and which were duly detailed the experiment was tried two or three times and although the domestic was treated with studious politeness and kindness she soon felt that she should be much more comfortable in the kitchen where she could talk eat and dress as she pleased a reasonable domestic can also be made to feel the propriety of allowing opportunity for the family to talk freely of their private affairs when they meet at meals as they never could do if restrained by the constant presence of a stranger such views presented in a kind and considerate manner will often entirely change the views of a domestic who is sensitive on such subjects when a domestic is forward and bold in manners and disrespectful in address a similar course can be pursued it can be shown that those who are among the bestbred and genteel have courteous and respectful manners and language to all they meet while many who have wealth are regarded as vulgar because they exhibit rude and disrespectful manners the very term gentleman indicates the refinement and delicacy of address which distinguishes the highbred from the coarse and vulgar in regard to appropriate dress in most cases it is difficult for an employer to interfere directly with comments or advice the most successful mode is to offer some service in mending or making a wardrobe and when a confidence in the kindness of feeling is thus gained remarks and suggestions will generally be properly received and new views of propriety and economy can be imparted in some cases it may be well for an employerwho from appearances anticipates difficulty of this kindin making the agreement to state that she wishes to have the room person and dress of her domestics kept neat and in order and that she expects to remind them of their duty in this particular if it is neglected domestics are very apt to neglect the care of their own chambers and clothing and such habits have a most pernicious influence on their wellbeing and on that of their children in future domestic life an employer then is bound to exercise a parental care over them in these respects in regard to the great deficiencies of domestics in qualifications for their duties much patience and benevolence are required multitudes have never been taught to do their work properly and in such cases how unreasonable it would be to expect it of them most persons of this class depend for their knowledge in domestic affairs not on their parents who are usually unqualified to instruct them but on their employers and if they live in a family where nothing is done neatly and properly they have no chance to learn how to perform their duties well when a lady finds that she must employ a domestic who is ignorant awkward and careless her first effort should be to make all proper allowance for past want of instruction and the next to remedy the evil by kind and patient teaching in doing this it should ever be borne in mind that nothing is more difficult than to change old habits and to learn to be thoughtful and considerate and a woman must make up her mind to tell the same thing over and over again and yet not lose her patience it will often save much vexation if on the arrival of a new domestic the mistress of the family or a daughter will for two or three days go round with the novice and show the exact manner in which it is expected the work will be done and this also it may be well to specify in the agreement as some domestics would otherwise resent such a supervision but it is often remarked that after a woman has taken all this pains to instruct a domestic and make her a good one some other person will offer higher wages and she will leave this doubtless is a sore trial but if such efforts were made in the true spirit of benevolence the lady will still have her reward in the consciousness that she has contributed to the welfare of society by making one more good domestic and one more comfortable family where that domestic is employed and if the latter becomes the mother of a family a whole circle of children will share in the benefit there is one great mistake not unfrequently made in the management both of domestics and of children and that is in supposing that the way to cure defects is by finding fault as each failing occurs but instead of this being true in many cases the directly opposite course is the best while in all instances much good judgement is required in order to decide when to notice faults and when to let them pass unnoticed there are some minds very sensitive easily discouraged and infirm of purpose such persons when they have formed habits of negligence haste and awkwardness often need expressions of sympathy and encouragement rather than reproof they have usually been found fault with so much that they have become either hardened or desponding and it is often the case that a few words of commendation will awaken fresh efforts and renewed hope in almost every case words of kindness confidence and encouragement should be mingled with the needful admonitions or reproof it is a good rule in reference to this point to forewarn instead of finding fault thus when a thing has been done wrong let it pass unnoticed till it is to be done again and then a simple request to have it done in the right way will secure quite as much and probably more willing effort than a reproof administered for neglect some persons seem to take it for granted that young and inexperienced minds are bound to have all the forethought and discretion of mature persons and freely express wonder and disgust when mishaps occur for want of these traits but it would be far better to save from mistake or forgetfulness by previous caution and care on the part of those who have gained experience and forethought and thus many occasions of complaint and illhumor will be avoided those who fill the places of heads of families are not very apt to think how painful it is to be chided for neglect of duty or for faults of character if they would sometimes imagine themselves in the place of those whom they control with some person daily administering reproof to them in the same tone and style as they employ to those who are under them it might serve as a useful check to their chidings it is often the case that persons who are most strict and exacting and least able to make allowances and receive palliations are themselves peculiarly sensitive to any thing which implies that they are in fault by such the spirit implied in the divine petition forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us needs especially to be cherished one other consideration is very important there is no duty more binding on christians than that of patience and meekness under provocations and disappointment now the tendency of every sensitive mind when thwarted in its wishes is to complain and find fault and that often in tones of fretfulness or anger but there are few domestics who have not heard enough of the bible to know that angry or fretful faultfinding from the mistress of a family when her work is not done to suit her is not in agreement with the precepts of christ they notice and feel the inconsistency and every woman when she gives way to feelings of anger and impatience at the faults of those around her lowers herself in their respect while her own conscience unless very much blinded cannot but suffer a wound there are some women who in the main are amiable who seem impressed with the idea that it is their office and duty to find fault with their domestics whenever any thing is not exactly right and follow their fancied calling without the least appearance of tenderness or sympathy as if the objects of their discipline were stocks or stones the writer once heard a domestic describing her situation in a family which she had left make this remark of her past employer she was a very good housekeeper allowed good wages and gave us many privileges and presents but if we ever did any thing wrong she always talked to us just as if she thought we had no feelings and i never was so unhappy in my life as while living with her and this was said of a kindhearted and conscientious woman by a very reasonable and amiable domestic every woman who has the care of domestics should cultivate a habit of regarding them with that sympathy and forbearance which she would wish for herself or her daughters if deprived of parents fortune and home the fewer advantages they have enjoyed and the greater difficulties of temper or of habit they have to contend with the more claims they have on compassionate forbearance they ought ever to be looked upon not as the mere ministers to our comfort and convenience but as the humbler and more neglected children of our heavenly father whom he has sent to claim our sympathy and aidn footnote n the excellent little work of miss sedgwick entitled live and let live contains many valuable and useful hints conveyed in a most pleasing narrative form which every housekeeper would do well to read the writer also begs leave to mention a work of her own entitled letters to persons engaged in domestic service chapter xix on the care of infants every young lady ought to learn how to take proper care of an infant for even if she is never to become the responsible guardian of a nursery she will often be in situations where she can render benevolent aid to others in this most fatiguing and anxious duty the writer has known instances in which young ladies who having been trained by their mothers properly to perform this duty were in some cases the means of saving the lives of infants and in others of relieving by their benevolent aid sick mothers from intolerable care and anguish on this point dr combe remarks all women are not destined in the course of nature to become mothers but how very small is the number of those who are unconnected by family ties friendship or sympathy with the children of others how very few are there who at some time or other of their lives would not find their usefulness and happiness increased by the possession of a kind of knowledge intimately allied to their best feelings and affections and how important is it to the mother herself that her efforts should be seconded by intelligent instead of ignorant assistants in order to be prepared for such benevolent ministries every young lady should improve the opportunity whenever it is afforded her for learning how to wash dress and tend a young infant and whenever she meets with such a work as dr combes on the management of infants she ought to read it and remember its contents it was the design of the author to fill this chapter chiefly with extracts from various medical writers giving some of the most important directions on this subject but finding these extracts too prolix for a work of this kind she has condensed them into a shorter compass some are quoted verbatim and some are abridged chiefly from the writings of doctors combe bell and eberle who are among the most approved writers on this subject nearly one half of the deaths occurring during the first two years of existence are ascribable to mismanagement and to errors in diet at birth the stomach is feeble and as yet unaccustomed to food its cravings are consequently easily satisfied and frequently renewed at that early age there ought to be no fixed time for giving nourishment the stomach cannot be thus satisfied the active call of the infant is a sign which needs never be mistaken but care must be taken to determine between the crying of pain or uneasiness and the call for food and the practice of giving an infant food to stop its cries is often the means of increasing its sufferings after a child has satisfied its hunger from two to four hours should intervene before another supply is given at birth the stomach and bowels never having been used contain a quantity of mucous secretion which requires to be removed to effect this nature has rendered the first portions of the mothers milk purposely watery and laxative nurses however distrusting nature often hasten to administer some active purgative and the consequence often is irritation in the stomach and bowels not easily subdued it is only where the child is deprived of its mothers milk as the first food that some gentle laxative should be given it is a common mistake to suppose that because a woman is nursing she ought to live very fully and to add an allowance of wine porter or other fermented liquor to her usual diet the only result of this plan is to cause an unnatural fulness in the system which places the nurse on the brink of disease and retards rather than increases the food of the infant more will be gained by the observance of the ordinary laws of health than by any foolish deviation founded on ignorance there is no point on which medical men so emphatically lift the voice of warning as in reference to administering medicines to infants it is so difficult to discover what is the matter with an infant its frame is so delicate and so susceptible and slight causes have such a powerful influence that it requires the utmost skill and judgement to ascertain what would be proper medicines and the proper quantity to be given says dr combe that there are cases in which active means must be promptly used to save the child is perfectly true but it is not less certain that these are cases of which no mother or nurse ought to attempt the treatment as a general rule where the child is well managed medicine of any kind is very rarely required and if disease were more generally regarded in its true light not as something thrust into the system which requires to be expelled by force but as an aberration from a natural mode of action produced by some external cause we should be in less haste to attack it by medicine and more watchful in its prevention accordingly where a constant demand for medicine exists in a nursery the mother may rest assured that there is something essentially wrong in the treatment of her children much havoc is made among infants by the abuse of calomel and other medicines which procure momentary relief but end by producing incurable disease and it has often excited my astonishment to see how recklessly remedies of this kind are had recourse to on the most trifling occasions by mothers and nurses who would be horrified if they knew the nature of the power they are wielding and the extent of injury they are inflicting instead then of depending on medicine for the preservation of the health and life of an infant the following precautions and preventives should be adopted take particular care of the food of an infant if it is nourished by the mother her own diet should be simple nourishing and temperate if the child be brought up by hand the milk of a newmilch cow mixed with one third water and sweetened a little with white sugar should be the only food given until the teeth come this is more suitable than any preparations of flour or arrowroot the nourishment of which is too highly concentrated never give a child bread cake or meat before the teeth appear if the food appear to distress the child after eating first ascertain if the milk be really from a newmilch cow as it may otherwise be too old learn also whether the cow lives on proper food cows that are fed on stillslops as is often the case in cities furnish milk which is very unhealthful be sure and keep a good supply of pure and fresh air in the nursery on this point dr bell remarks respecting rooms constructed without fireplaces and without doors or windows to let in pure air from without the sufferings of children of feeble constitutions are increased beyond measure by such lodgings as these an action brought by the commonwealth ought to lie against those persons who build houses for sale or rent in which rooms are so constructed as not to allow of free ventilation and a writ of lunacy taken out against those who with the commonsense experience which all have on this head should spend any portion of their time still more should sleep in rooms thus nearly airtight after it is a month or two old take an infant out to walk or ride in a little wagon every fair and warm day but be very careful that its feet and every part of its body are kept warm and be sure that its eyes are well protected from the light weak eyes and sometimes blindness are caused by neglecting this precaution keep the head of an infant cool never allowing too warm bonnets nor permitting it to sink into soft pillows when asleep keeping an infants head too warm very much increases nervous irritability and this is the reason why medical men forbid the use of caps for infants but the head of an infant should especially while sleeping be protected from draughts of air and from getting cold be very careful of the skin of an infant as nothing tends so effectually to prevent disease for this end it should be washed all over every morning and then gentle friction should be applied with the hand to the back stomach bowels and limbs the head should be thoroughly washed every day and then brushed with a soft hairbrush or combed with a fine comb if by neglect dirt accumulates under the hair apply with the finger the yolk of an egg and then the fine comb will remove it all without any trouble dress the infant so that it will be always warm but not so as to cause perspiration be sure and keep its feet always warm and for this end often warm them at a fire and use long dresses keep the neck and arms covered for this purpose wrappers open in front made high in the neck with long sleeves to put on over the frock are now very fashionable it is better for both mother and child that it should not sleep on the mothers arm at night unless the weather be extremely cold this practice keeps the child too warm and leads it to seek food too frequently a child should ordinarily take nourishment but twice in the night a crib beside the mother with a plenty of warm and light covering is best for the child but the mother must be sure that it is always kept warm never cover a childs head so that it will inhale the air of its own lungs in very warm weather especially in cities great pains should be taken to find fresh and cool air by rides and sailing walks in a public square in the cool of the morning and frequent excursions in ferry or steamboats would often save a long bill for medical attendance in hot nights the windows should be kept open and the infant laid on a mattress or on folded blankets a bit of straw matting laid over a featherbed and covered with the under sheet makes a very cool bed for an infant cool bathing in hot weather is very useful but the water should be very little cooler than the skin of the child when the constitution is delicate the water should be slightly warmed simply sponging the body freely in a tub answers the same purpose as a regular bath in very warm weather this should be done two or three times a day always waiting two or three hours after food has been given when the stomach is peculiarly irritable from teething it is of paramount necessity to withhold all the nostrums which have been so falsely lauded as sovereign cures for cholera infantum the true restoratives to a child threatened with disease are cool air cool bathing and cool drinks of simple water in addition to proper food at stated intervals do not take the advice of mothers who tell of this that and the other thing which have proved excellent remedies in their experience children have different constitutions and there are multitudes of different causes for their sickness and what might cure one child might kill another which appeared to have the same complaint a mother should go on the general rule of giving an infant very little medicine and then only by the direction of a discreet and experienced physician and there are cases when according to the views of the most distinguished and competent practitioners physicians themselves are much too free in using medicines instead of adopting preventive measures do not allow a child to form such habits that it will not be quiet unless tended and amused a healthy child should be accustomed to lie or sit in its cradle much of the time but it should occasionally be taken up and tossed or carried about for exercise and amusement an infant should be encouraged to creep as an exercise very strengthening and useful if the mother fears the soiling of its nice dresses she can keep a long slip or apron which will entirely cover the dress and can be removed when the child is taken in the arms a child should not be allowed when quite young to bear its weight on its feet very long at a time as this tends to weaken and distort the limbs many mothers with a little painstaking succeed in putting their infants while awake into their cradle at regular hours for sleep and induce regularity in other habits which saves much trouble in doing this a child may cry at first a great deal but for a healthy child this use of the lungs does no harm and tends rather to strengthen than to injure them a child who is trained to lie or sit and amuse itself is happier than one who is carried and tended a great deal and thus rendered restless and uneasy when not so indulged chapter xx on the management of young children in regard to the physical education of children dr clarke physician in ordinary to the queen of england expresses views on one point in which most physicians would coincide he says there is no greater error in the management of children than that of giving them animal diet very early by persevering in the use of an overstimulating diet the digestive organs become irritated and the various secretions immediately connected with and necessary to digestion are diminished especially the biliary secretion children so fed become very liable to attacks of fever and of inflammation affecting particularly the mucous membranes and measles and the other diseases incident to childhood are generally severe in their attack there are some popular notions on the subject of the use of animal food which need to be corrected one mistake is in supposing that the formation of the human teeth and stomach indicate that man was designed to feed on flesh linnus says that the organization of man when compared with other animals shows that fruits and esculent vegetables constitute his most suitable food baron cuvier the highest authority on comparative anatomy says the natural food of man judging from his structure appears to consist of fruits roots and other succulent parts of vegetables another common mistake is that the stimulus of animal food is necessary for the full developement of the physical and intellectual powers this notion is disproved by facts the inhabitants of lapland and kamtschatka who live altogether on animal food are among the smallest weakest and most timid of races but the scotch highlanders who in a very cold climate live almost exclusively on milk and vegetable diet are among the bravest largest and most athletic of men the southsea islanders who live almost exclusively on fruits and vegetables are said to be altogether superior to english sailors in strength and agility an intelligent gentleman who spent many months in siberia testifies that no exiles endure the climate better than those who have all their lives been accustomed to a vegetable diet the stoutest and largest tribes in africa live solely on vegetable diet and the bright intelligent and active arabs live entirely on milk and vegetables the popular notion is that animal food is more nourishing than vegetable but on this point scientific men hold different opinions experiments repeatedly made by some chemists seem to prove the contrary tables have been prepared showing the amount of nutriment in each kind of food by which it would appear that while beef contains thirtyfive per cent of nutritious matter wheatbread and rice contain from eighty to ninetyfive per cent the supposed mistake is attributed to the fact that on account of the stimulating nature of animal food it digests easier and more quickly than vegetables many physicians however among them dr combeo are of opinion that animal food contains a greater quantity of nutriment in a given bulk than either herbaceous or farinaceous food in some diseases too meat is better for the stomach than vegetables the largest proportion of those who have been remarkable for having lived to the greatest age were persons whose diet was almost exclusively vegetables and it is a wellknown fact that the pulse of a hardy and robust man who lives on simple vegetable diet is from ten to twenty beats less in a minute than that of men who live on a mixed diet in regard to the intellect dr franklin asserted from experience that an exclusively vegetable diet promotes clearness of ideas and quickness of perception and is to be preferred by all who labor with the mind the mightiest efforts of sir isaac newton were performed while nourished only by bread and water many other men distinguished by intellectual vigor give similar testimony these facts show that animal food is not needful to secure the perfect developement of mind or bodyp the result of the treatment of the inmates of the orphan asylum at albany is one upon which all who have the care of young children should deeply ponder during the first six years of the existence of this institution its average number of children was eighty for the first three years their diet was meat once a day fine bread rice indian puddings vegetables fruit and milk considerable attention was given to clothing fresh air and exercise and they were bathed once in three weeks during these three years from four to six children and sometimes more were continually on the sicklist one or two assistant nurses were necessary a physician was called two or three times a week and in this time there were between thirty and forty deaths at the end of this period the management was changed in these respectsdaily ablutions of the whole body were practised bread of unbolted flour was substituted for that of fine wheat and all animal food was banished more attention also was paid to clothing bedding fresh air and exercise the result was that the nursery was vacated the nurse and physician were no longer needed and for two years not a single case of sickness or death occurred the third year also there were no deaths except those of two idiots and one other child all of whom were new inmates who had not been subjected to this treatment the teachers of the children also testified that there was a manifest increase of intellectual vigor and activity while there was much less irritability of temper let parents nurses and teachers reflect on the above statement and bear in mind that stupidity of intellect and irritability of temper as well as ill health are often caused by the mismanagement of the nursery in regard to the physical training of children there is probably no practice more deleterious than that of allowing children to eat at short intervals through the day as the stomach is thus kept constantly at work with no time for repose its functions are deranged and a weak or disordered stomach is the frequent result children should be required to keep cakes nuts and other good things which they may have to eat till just before a meal and then they will form a part of their regular supply this is better than to wait till after their hunger is satisfied by food when they will eat their niceties merely to gratify the palate and thus overload the stomach in regard to the intellectual training of young children some modification in the common practice is necessary with reference to their physical wellbeing more care is needful in providing wellventilated schoolrooms and in securing more time for sports in the open air during school hours it is very important to most mothers that their young children should be removed from their care during the six school hours and it is very useful to quite young children to be subjected to the discipline of a school and to intercourse with other children of their own age and with a suitable teacher it is no matter how early children are sent to school provided their health is not endangered by impure air too much confinement and too great mental stimulus in regard to the formation of the moral character it has been too much the case that the discipline of the nursery has consisted of disconnected efforts to make children either do or refrain from doing certain particular acts do this and be rewarded do that and be punished is the ordinary routine of family government but children can be very early taught that their happiness both now and hereafter depends on the formation of habits of submission selfdenial and benevolence and all the discipline of the nursery can be conducted by the parents not only with this general aim in their own minds but also with the same object daily set before the minds of the children whenever their wishes are crossed or their wills subdued they can be taught that all this is done not merely to please the parent or to secure some good to themselves or to others but as a part of that merciful training which is designed to form such a character and such habits that they can hereafter find their chief happiness in giving up their will to god and in living to do good to others instead of living merely to please themselves it can be pointed out to them that they must always submit their will to the will of god or else be continually miserable it can be shown how in the nursery and in the school and through all future days a child must practise the giving up of his will and wishes when they interfere with the rights and comfort of others and how important it is early to learn to do this so that it will by habit become easy and agreeable it can be shown how children who are indulged in all their wishes and who are never accustomed to any selfdenial always find it hard to refrain from what injures themselves and others it can be shown also how important it is for every person to form such habits of benevolence towards others that selfdenial in doing good will become easy parents have learned by experience that children can be constrained by authority and penalties to exercise selfdenial for their own good till a habit is formed which makes the duty comparatively easy for example welltrained children can be accustomed to deny themselves tempting articles of food which are injurious until the practice ceases to be painful and difficult whereas an indulged child would be thrown into fits of anger or discontent when its wishes were crossed by restraints of this kind but it has not been so readily discerned that the same method is needful in order to form a habit of selfdenial in doing good to others it has been supposed that while children must be forced by authority to be selfdenying and prudent in regard to their own happiness it may properly be left to their own discretion whether they will practise any selfdenial in doing good to others but the more difficult a duty is the greater is the need of parental authority in forming a habit which will make that duty easy in order to secure this some parents turn their earliest efforts to this object they require the young child always to offer to others a part of every thing which it receives always to comply with all reasonable requests of others for service and often to practise little acts of selfdenial in order to secure some enjoyment for others if one child receives a present of some nicety he is required to share it with all his brothers and sisters if one asks his brother to help him in some sport and is met with a denial the parent requires the unwilling child to act benevolently and give up some of his time to increase his brothers enjoyment of course in such an effort as this discretion must be used as to the frequency and extent of the exercise of authority to induce a habit of benevolence but where parents deliberately aim at such an object and wisely conduct their instructions and discipline to secure it very much will be accomplished religious influence should be brought to bear directly upon this point in the very beginning of religious instruction jesus christ should be presented to the child as that great and good being who came into this world to teach children how to be happy both here and hereafter he who made it his meat and drink to do the will of his heavenly father who in the humblest station and most destitute condition denied himself daily and went about doing good should constantly be presented as the object of their imitation and as nothing so strongly influences the minds of children as the sympathy and example of a present friend all those who believe him to be an everpresent saviour should avail themselves of this powerful aid under such training jesus christ should be constantly presented to them as their everwatchful tender and sympathizing friend if the abstract idea of an unembodied spirit with the majestic attributes of deity be difficult for the mind of infancy to grasp the simple the gentle the lovely character of christ is exactly adapted to the wants and comprehension of a child in this view how touching is the language of the saviour to his misjudging disciples suffer the little children to come unto me in regard to forming habits of obedience there have been two extremes both of which need to be shunned one is a stern and unsympathizing maintenance of parental authority demanding perfect and constant obedience without any attempt to convince a child of the propriety and benevolence of the requisitions and without any manifestation of sympathy and tenderness for the pain and difficulties which are to be met under such discipline children grow up to fear their parents rather than to love and trust them while some of the most valuable principles of character are chilled or forever blasted in shunning this danger other parents pass to the opposite extreme they put themselves too much on the footing of equals with their children as if little were due to superiority of relation age and experience nothing is exacted without the implied concession that the child is to be a judge of the propriety of the requisition and reason and persuasion are employed where simple command and obedience would be far better this system produces a most pernicious influence children soon perceive the position thus allowed them and take every advantage of it they soon learn to dispute parental requirements acquire habits of forwardness and conceit assume disrespectful manners and address maintain their views with pertinacity and yield to authority with illhumor and resentment as if their rights were infringed the medium course is for the parent to take the attitude of a superior in age knowledge and relation who has a perfect right to control every action of the child and that too without giving any reason for the requisitions obey because your parent commands is always a proper and sufficient reason but care should be taken to convince the child that the parent is conducting a course of discipline designed to make him happy and in forming habits of implicit obedience selfdenial and benevolence the child should have the reasons for most requisitions kindly stated never however on the demand of it from the child as a right but as an act of kindness from the parent it is impossible to govern children properly especially those of strong and sensitive feelings without a constant effort to appreciate the value which they attach to their enjoyments and pursuits a lady of great strength of mind and sensibility once told the writer that one of the most acute periods of suffering in her whole life was occasioned by the burning up of some milkweedsilk by her mother the child had found for the first time some of this shining and beautiful substance was filled with delight at her discovery was arranging it in parcels planning its future uses and her pleasure in showing it to her companionswhen her mother finding it strewed over the carpet hastily swept it into the fire and that too with so indifferent an air that the child fled away almost distracted with grief and disappointment the mother little realized the pain she had inflicted but the child felt the unkindness so severely that for several days her mother was an object almost of aversion while therefore the parent needs to carry on a steady course which will oblige the child always to give up its will whenever its own good or the greater claims of others require it this should be constantly connected with the expression of a tender sympathy for the trials and disappointments thus inflicted those who will join with children and help them along in their sports will learn by this mode to understand the feelings and interests of childhood while at the same time they secure a degree of confidence and affection which cannot be gained so easily in any other way and it is to be regretted that parents so often relinquish this most powerful mode of influence to domestics and playmates who often use it in the most pernicious manner in joining in such sports older persons should never relinquish the attitude of superiors or allow disrespectful manners or address and respectful deportment is never more cheerfully accorded than in seasons when young hearts are pleased and made grateful by having their tastes and enjoyments so efficiently promoted next to the want of all government the two most fruitful sources of evil to children are unsteadiness in government and overgovernment most of the cases in which the children of sensible and conscientious parents turn out badly result from one or the other of these causes in cases of unsteady government either one parent is very strict severe and unbending and the other excessively indulgent or else the parents are sometimes very strict and decided and at other times allow disobedience to go unpunished in such cases children never knowing exactly when they can escape with impunity are constantly tempted to make the trial the bad effects of this can be better appreciated by reference to one important principle of the mind it is found to be universally true that when any object of desire is put entirely beyond the reach of hope or expectation the mind very soon ceases to long for it and turns to other objects of pursuit but so long as the mind is hoping for some good and making efforts to obtain it any opposition excites irritable feelings let the object be put entirely beyond all hope and this irritation soon ceases in consequence of this principle those children who are under the care of persons of steady and decided government know that whenever a thing is forbidden or denied it is out of the reach of hope the desire therefore soon ceases and they turn to other objects but the children of undecided or of overindulgent parents never enjoy this preserving aid when a thing is denied they never know but either coaxing may win it or disobedience secure it without any penalty and so they are kept in that state of hope and anxiety which produces irritation and tempts to insubordination the children of very indulgent parents and of those who are undecided and unsteady in government are very apt to become fretful irritable and fractious another class of persons in shunning this evil go to the other extreme and are very strict and pertinacious in regard to every requisition with them faultfinding and penalties abound until the children are either hardened into indifference of feeling and obtuseness of conscience or else become excessively irritable or misanthropic it demands great wisdom patience and selfcontrol to escape these two extremes in aiming at this there are parents who have found the following maxims of very great value first avoid as much as possible the multiplication of rules and absolute commands instead of this take the attitude of advisers my child this is improper i wish you would remember not to do it this mode of address answers for all the little acts of heedlessness awkwardness or illmanners so frequently occurring with children there are cases when direct and distinct commands are needful and in such cases a penalty for disobedience should be as steady and sure as the laws of nature where such steadiness and certainty of penalty attend disobedience children no more think of disobeying than they do of putting their fingers in a burning candle the next maxim is govern by rewards more than by penalties such faults as wilful disobedience lying dishonesty and indecent or profane language should be punished with severe penalties after a child has been fully instructed in the evil of such practices but all the constantlyrecurring faults of the nursery such as illhumor quarrelling carelessness and illmanners may in a great many cases be regulated by gentle and kind remonstrances and by the offer of some reward for persevering efforts to form a good habit it is very injurious and degrading to any mind to be kept under the constant fear of penalties love and hope are the principles that should be mainly relied on in forming the habits of childhood another maxim and perhaps the most difficult is do not govern by the aid of severe and angry tones a single example will be given to illustrate this maxim a child is disposed to talk and amuse itself at table the mother requests it to be silent except when needing to ask for food or when spoken to by its older friends it constantly forgets the mother instead of rebuking in an impatient tone says my child you must remember not to talk i will remind you of it four times more and after that whenever you forget you must leave the table and wait till we are done if the mother is steady in her government it is not probable that she will have to apply this slight penalty more than once or twice this method is far more effectual than the use of sharp and severe tones to secure attention and recollection and often answers the purpose as well as offering some reward the writer has been in some families where the most efficient and steady government has been sustained without the use of a cross or angry tone and in others where a far less efficient discipline was kept up by frequent severe rebukes and angry remonstrances in the first case the children followed the example set them and seldom used severe tones to each other in the latter the method employed by the parents was imitated by the children and cross words and angry tones resounded from morning till night in every portion of the household another important maxim is try to keep children in a happy state of mind every one knows by experience that it is easier to do right and submit to rule when cheerful and happy than when irritated this is peculiarly true of children and a wise mother when she finds her child fretful and impatient and thus constantly doing wrong will often remedy the whole difficulty by telling some amusing story or by getting the child engaged in some amusing sport this strongly shows the importance of learning to govern children without the employment of angry tones which always produce irritation children of active heedless temperament or those who are odd awkward or unsuitable in their remarks and deportment are often essentially injured by a want of patience and selfcontrol in those who govern them such children often possess a morbid sensibility which they strive to conceal or a desire of love and approbation which preys like a famine on the soul and yet they become objects of ridicule and rebuke to almost every member of the family until their sensibilities are tortured into obtuseness or misanthropy such children above all others need tenderness and sympathy a thousand instances of mistake or forgetfulness should be passed over in silence while opportunities for commendation and encouragement should be diligently sought in regard to the formation of habits of selfdenial in childhood it is astonishing to see how parents who are very sensible often seem to regard this matter instead of inuring their children to this duty in early life so that by habit it may be made easy in afterdays they seem to be studiously seeking to cut them off from every chance to secure such a preparation every wish of the child is studiously gratified and where a necessity exists of crossing its wishes some compensating pleasure is offered in return such parents often maintain that nothing shall be put on their table which their children may not join them in eating but where so easily and surely as at the daily meal can that habit of selfdenial be formed which is so needful in governing the appetites and which children must acquire or be ruined the food which is proper for grown persons is often unsuitable for children and this is a sufficient reason for accustoming them to see others partake of delicacies which they must not share requiring children to wait till others are helped and to refrain from conversation at table except when addressed by their elders is another mode of forming habits of selfdenial and selfcontrol requiring them to help others first and to offer the best to others has a similar influence in forming the moral habits of children it is wise to take into account the peculiar temptations to which they are to be exposed the people of this nation are eminently a trafficking people and the present standard of honesty as to trade and debts is very low and every year seems sinking still lower it is therefore preeminently important that children should be trained to strict honesty both in word and deed it is not merely teaching children to avoid absolute lying which is needed all kinds of deceit should be guarded against and all kinds of little dishonest practices be strenuously opposed a child should be brought up with the determined principle never to run in debt but to be content to live in an humbler way in order to secure that true independence which should be the noblest distinction of an american citizen there is no more important duty devolving upon a mother than the cultivation of habits of modesty and propriety in young children all indecorous words or deportment should be carefully restrained and delicacy and reserve studiously cherished it is a common notion that it is important to secure these virtues to one sex more than to the other and by a strange inconsistency the sex most exposed to danger is the one selected as least needing care but a wise mother will be especially careful that her sons are trained to modesty and purity of mind but few mothers are sufficiently aware of the dreadful penalties which often result from indulged impurity of thought if children in future life can be preserved from licentious associates it is supposed that their safety is secured but the records of our insane retreats and the pages of medical writers teach that even in solitude and without being aware of the sin or the danger children may inflict evils on themselves which not unfrequently terminate in disease delirium and death every mother and every teacher therefore carefully avoiding all explanation of the mystery should teach the young that the indulgence of impure thoughts and actions is visited by the most awful and terrific penalties disclosing the details of vice in order to awaken dread of its penalties is a most dangerous experiment and often leads to the very evils feared the attempts made in late years to guard children from future dangers by circulating papers and books of warning and information have led to such frightful results that it is hoped the experiment will never again be pursued the safest course is to cultivate habits of modesty and delicacy and to teach that all impure thoughts words and actions are forbidden by god and are often visited by the most dreadful punishment at the same time it is important for mothers to protect the young mind from false notions of delicacy it should be shown that whatever is necessary to save from suffering or danger must be met without shame or aversion and that all which god has instituted is wise and right and pure it is in reference to these dangers that mothers and teachers should carefully guard the young from those highlywrought fictions which lead the imagination astray and especially from that class of licentious works made interesting by genius and taste which have flooded this country and which are often found on the parlor table even of moral and christian people of this class the writings of bulwer stand conspicuous the only difference between some of his works and the obscene prints for vending which men suffer the penalties of the law is that the last are so gross as to revolt the taste and startle the mind to resistance while bulwer presents the same ideas so clothed in the fascinations of taste and genius as most insidiously to seduce the unwary it seems to be the chief aim of this licentious writer to make thieves murderers and adulterers appear beautiful refined and interesting it is time that all virtuous persons in the community should rise in indignation not only against the writers but the venders of such poison footnotes o see his physiology of digestion considered with relation to the principles of dietetics issued by the publishers of this work p the writer is not an advocate for total abstinence from animal food she coincides with the best authorities in thinking that adults eat too much that children while growing should eat very little and quite young children none at all chapter xxi on the care of the sick every woman who has the care of young children or of a large family is frequently called upon to advise what shall be done for some one who is indisposed and often in circumstances where she must trust solely to her own judgement in such cases some err by neglecting to do any thing at all till the patient is quite sick but a still greater number err from excessive and injurious dosing the two great causes of the ordinary slight attacks of illness in a family are sudden chills which close the pores of the skin and thus affect the throat lungs or bowels and the excessive or improper use of food in most cases of illness from the first cause bathing the feet and some aperient drink to induce perspiration are suitable remedies a slight cathartic also is often serviceable in case of illness from improper food or excess in eating fasting for one or two meals to give the system time and chance to relieve itself is the safest remedy sometimes a gentle cathartic may be needful but it is best first to try fasting the following extract from a discourse of dr burne before the london medical society contains important information in civilized life the causes which are most generally and continually operating in the production of diseases are affections of the mind improper diet and retention of the intestinal excretions the undue retention of excrementitious matter allows of the absorption of its more liquid parts which is a cause of great impurity to the blood and the excretions thus rendered hard and knotty act more or less as extraneous substances and by their irritation produce a determination of blood to the intestines and to the neighboring viscera which ultimately ends in inflammation it also has a great effect on the whole system causes a determination of blood to the head which oppresses the brain and dejects the mind deranges the functions of the stomach causes flatulency and produces a general state of discomfort dr combe remarks on this subject in the natural and healthy state under a proper system of diet and with sufficient exercise the bowels are relieved regularly once every day habit is powerful in modifying the result and in sustaining healthy action when once fairly established hence the obvious advantage of observing as much regularity in relieving the system as in taking our meals it is often the case that soliciting nature at a regular period once a day will remedy constipation without medicine and induce a regular and healthy state of the bowels when however as most frequently happens the constipation arises from the absence of all assistance from the abdominal and respiratory muscles the first step to be taken is again to solicit their aid first by removing all impediments to free respiration such as stays waistbands and belts secondly by resorting to such active exercises as shall call the muscles into full and regular action and lastly by proportioning the quantity of food to the wants of the system and the condition of the digestive organs if we employ these means systematically and perseveringly we shall rarely fail in at last restoring the healthy action of the bowels with little aid from medicine but if we neglect these modes we may go on for years adding pill to pill and dose to dose without ever attaining the end at which we aim there is no point in which a woman needs more knowledge and discretion than in administering remedies for what seem slight attacks which are not supposed to require the attention of a physician it is little realized that purgative drugs are unnatural modes of stimulating the internal organs tending to exhaust them of their secretions and to debilitate and disturb the animal economy for this reason they should be used as little as possible and fasting and perspiration and the other methods pointed out should always be first resorted to when medicine must be given it should be borne in mind that there are various classes of purgatives which produce very diverse effects some like salts operate to thin the blood and reduce the system others are stimulating and others have a peculiar operation on certain organs of course great discrimination and knowledge is needed in order to select the kind which is suitable to the particular disease or to the particular constitution of the invalid this shows the folly of using the many kinds of pills and other quack medicines where no knowledge can be had of their composition pills which are good for one kind of disease might operate as poison in another state of the system it is wise to keep always on hand some simple cathartic for family use in slight attacks and always to resort to medical advice whenever powerful remedies seem to be demandedq it is very common in cases of colds which affect the lungs or throat to continue to try one dose after another for relief it will be well to bear in mind at such times that all which goes into the stomach must be first absorbed into the blood before it can reach the diseased part and that there is some danger of injuring the stomach or other parts of the system by such a variety of doses many of which it is probable will be directly contradictory in their nature and thus neutralize any supposed benefit they might separately impart it is very unwise to tempt the appetite of a person who is indisposed the cessation of appetite is the warning of nature that the system is in such a state that food cannot be digested the following suggestions may be found useful in regard to nursing the sick as nothing contributes more to the restoration of health than pure air it should be a primary object to keep a sickroom well ventilated at least twice in the twentyfour hours the patient should be well covered and fresh air freely admitted from out of doors after this if need be the room should be restored to a proper temperature by the aid of a fire bedding and clothing should also be well aired and frequently changed as the exhalations from the body in sickness are peculiarly deleterious frequent ablutions of the whole body if possible are very useful and for these warm water may be employed the following are useful directions for dressing a blister spread thinly on a linen cloth an ointment composed of one third of beeswax to two thirds of tallow lay this upon a linen cloth folded many times with a sharp pair of scissors make an aperture in the lower part of the bag of water with a little hole above to give it vent break the raised skin as little as possible lay on the cloth spread as directed the blister at first should be dressed as often as three times in a day and the dressing renewed each time a sickroom should always be kept very neat and in perfect order and all haste noise and bustle should be avoided in order to secure neatness order and quiet in case of long illness the following arrangements should be made keep a large box for fuel which will need to be filled only twice in twentyfour hours provide also and keep in the room or an adjacent closet a small teakettle a saucepan a pail of water for drinks and ablutions a pitcher a covered porringer two pint bowls two tumblers two cups and saucers two wine glasses two large and two small spoons also a dish in which to wash these articles a good supply of towels and a broom keep a slopbucket near by to receive the wash of the room procuring all these articles at once will save much noise and confusion whenever medicine or food is given spread a clean towel over the person or bedclothing and get a clean handkerchief as nothing is more annoying to a weak stomach than the stickiness and soiling produced by medicine and food keep the fireplace neat and always wash all articles and put them in order as soon as they are out of use a sick person has nothing to do but look about the room and when every thing is neat and in order a feeling of comfort is induced while disorder filth and neglect are constant objects of annoyance which if not complained of are yet felt always prepare food for the sick in the neatest and most careful manner it is in sickness that the senses of smell and taste are most susceptible of annoyance and often little mistakes or negligences in preparing food will take away all appetite food for the sick should be cooked on coals that no smoke may have access to it and great care must be taken to prevent any adherence to the bottom as this always gives a disagreeable taste keeping clean handkerchiefs and towels at hand cooling the pillows sponging the hands with water swabbing the mouth with a clean linen rag on the end of a stick are modes of increasing the comfort of the sick always throw a shawl over a sick person when raised up be careful to understand a physicians directions and to obey them implicitly if it be supposed that any other person knows better about the case than the physician dismiss the physician and employ that person in his stead in nursing the sick always speak gently and cheeringly and while you express sympathy for their pain and trials stimulate them to bear all with fortitude and with resignation to him who has appointed the trial offer to read the bible or other devotional books whenever it is suitable and will not be deemed obtrusive it is always best to consult the physician as to where medicines shall be purchased and to show the articles to him before using them as great impositions are practised in selling old useless and adulterated drugs always put labels on vials of medicine and keep them out of the reach of children be careful to label all powders and particularly all white powders as many poisonous medicines in this form are easily mistaken for others which are harmless footnote q the following electuary by a distinguished physician is used by many friends of the writer as a standing resort in cases of constipation or where a gentle cathartic is needed one recommendation of it is that children always love it and eat the pills as good plums two ounces of powdered senna one ounce of cream of tartar one ounce of sulphur mixed with sufficient confection of senna to form an electuary make this into pills of the size of peas and give a young child two or three as the case may be taking three pills every night will generally relieve constipation in an adult chapter xxii on accidents and antidotes when serious accidents occur medical aid should be immediately procured till that can be done the following directions may be useful when a child has any thing in its throat first try with the finger to get the article up if this cannot be done push it down into the stomach with a smooth elastic stick if the article be a pin sharp bone glass or other cutting substance give an emetic which will immediately operate in the case of a common cut bind the lips of the wound together with a rag and put nothing else on if the cut be large and so situated that rags will not bind it together use sticking plaster cut in strips and laid obliquely across the cut sometimes it is needful to take a stitch with a needle and thread on each lip of the wound and draw the two sides together if an artery be cut it must be immediately tied up or the person will bleed to death the blood from an artery is of a bright red color and spirts out in regular jets at each beat of the heart take up the bleeding end of the artery and hold it or tie it up till a surgeon comes when the artery cannot be found and in all cases of bad cuts on any of the limbs apply compression when it can be done tie a very tight bandage above the wound if it be below the heart and below if the wound be above the heart put a stick into the band and twist it as tight as can be borne till surgical aid be obtained bathe bad bruises in hot water or hot spirits or a decoction of bitter herbs entire rest is the remedy for sprains bathing in warm water or warm whiskey is very useful a sprained leg should be kept in a horizontal position on a bed or sofa when a leg is broken tie it to the other leg to keep it still and if possible get a surgeon before the limb swells bind a broken arm to a piece of shingle and keep it still till it is set in case of a blow on the head or a fall causing insensibility use a mustard paste on the back of the neck and pit of the stomach and rub the body with spirits after the circulation is restored bleeding is often necessary but it is very dangerous to attempt it before in cases of bad burns where the skin is taken off the great aim should be to keep the injured part from the air for this purpose sprinkle on flour or apply a liniment made of linseed oil and limewater in equal quantities sweetoil on cotton is good and with laudanum alleviates pain but many skins cannot bear the application of raw cotton which is sometimes very good when a dressing is put on do not remove it as it will be sure to protract the cure by admitting the air in case of drowning lay the person in a warm bed or on blankets on the right side with the head raised and a little inclined forward clear the mouth with the fingers and cautiously apply hartshorn to the nose raise the heat of the body by bottles of warm water applied to the pit of the stomach armpits groins and soles of the feet apply friction to the whole body with warm hands and cloths dipped in warm spirits of camphor endeavor to produce the natural action of the lungs by introducing the nose of a bellows into one nostril and closing the other at the same time pressing on the throat to close the gullet when the lungs are thus inflated press gently on the breast and belly and continue the process for a long time cases have been known where efforts have been protracted eight or ten hours without effect and then have proved successful rolling the body on a barrel suspending it by the heels giving injections of tobacco and many other practices which have been common are highly injurious after signs of life appear give small quantities of wine or spirits and water in cases of poisoning from corrosive sublimate beat up the whites of twelve eggs mix them in two quarts of water and give a tumbler full every three minutes till vomiting is produced this is the surest remedy when this is not at hand fill the stomach in like manner with any mucilaginous substance such as gum and water flaxseed or slipperyelmbark tea flour and water or sugar and water in great quantities are next best and if none of these be at hand give copious draughts of water alone in case of poisoning from arsenic cobalt or any such mineral administer as soon as possible large quantities of limewater and sugaredwater of warm or even of cold water or of flaxseed tea or some other mucilaginous drink to distend the stomach and produce immediate vomiting and thereby eject the poison if opium or any of its preparations has been taken in dangerous quantities induce vomiting without a moments unnecessary delay by giving immediately in a small quantity of water ten grains of ipecac and ten grains of sulphate of zinc white vitriol which is the most prompt emetic known and repeat the dose every fifteen minutes till the stomach is entirely emptied where white vitriol is not at hand substitute three or four grains of blue vitriol sulphate of copper when the stomach is emptied but not before give every ten minutes alternately a cup of acid drink and a cup of very strong coffee made by pouring a pint of boiling water on a quarter of a pound of ground burnt coffee and letting it stand ten minutes and then straining it continue these drinks till the danger is over dash cold water on the head apply friction to the body and keep the person in constant motion to prevent sleep if any kind of acid be taken in poisonous quantities give strong pearlashwater if ley or pearlash or any alkali be taken give sweetoil or if this be wanting lampoil or if neither be at hand give vinegar freely in case of stupefaction from the fumes of charcoal or from entering a well limekiln or coal mine expose the person to cold air lying on his back dash cold water on the head and breast and rub the body with spirits of camphor vinegar or cologne water apply mustard paste to the pit of the stomach and use friction on the hands feet and whole length of the back bone give some acid drink and when the person revives place him in a warm bed in fresh air be prompt and persevering in case of bleeding at the lungs or stomach or throat give a teaspoonful of dry salt and repeat it often for bleeding at the nose pour cold water on the back of the neck keeping the head elevated if a person be struck with lightning throw pailfuls of cold water on the head and body and apply mustard poultices on the stomach with friction of the whole body and inflation of the lungs when no other emetic can be found pounded mustard seed taken a teaspoonful at a time will answer the ground mustard is not so effectual but will do in case of fire wrap a woollen blanket about you to protect from the fire if the staircases are on fire tie the corners of the sheets together very firmly fasten one end to the bedstead draw it to the window and let yourself down never read in bed lest you fall asleep and the bed be set on fire if your clothes get on fire never run but lie down and roll about till you can reach a bed or carpet to wrap yourself in and thus put out the fire keep young children in woollen dresses to save them from the risk of fire in thunderstorms shut the doors and windows the safest part of a room is its centre and where there is a featherbed in the apartment that will be found the most secure restingplace a lightning rod if it be well pointed and run deep into the earth is a certain protection to a circle around it whose diameter equals the height of the rod above the highest chimney but it protects no further than this extent chapter xxiii on domestic amusements and social duties whenever the laws of body and mind are properly understood it will be allowed that every person needs some kind of recreation and that by seeking it the body is strengthened the mind is invigorated and all our duties are more cheerfully and successfully performed children whose bodies are rapidly growing and whose nervous system is tender and excitable need much more amusement than persons of mature age persons also who are oppressed with great responsibilities and duties or who are taxed by great intellectual or moral excitement need recreations which secure physical exercise and draw off the mind from absorbing interests unfortunately such persons are those who least resort to amusements while the idle gay and thoughtless seek those which are needless and for which useful occupation would be a most beneficial substitute as the only legitimate object of amusements is to prepare mind and body for the proper discharge of duty any protracting of such as interfere with regular employments or induce excessive fatigue or weary the mind or invade the proper hours for repose must be sinful in deciding what should be selected and what avoided the following rules are binding in the first place no amusements which inflict needless pain should ever be allowed all tricks which cause fright or vexation and all sports which involve suffering to animals should be utterly forbidden hunting and fishing for mere sport can never be justified if a man can convince his children that he follows these pursuits to gain food or health and not for amusement his example may not be very injurious but when children see grown persons kill and frighten animals for sport habits of cruelty rather than feelings of tenderness and benevolence are induced in the next place we should seek no recreations which endanger life or interfere with important duties as the only legitimate object of amusements is to promote health and prepare for more serious duties selecting those which have a directly opposite tendency cannot be justified of course if a person feel that the previous days diversions have shortened the hours of needful repose or induced a lassitude of mind or body instead of invigorating them it is certain that an evil has been done which should never be repeated a third rule is to avoid those amusements which experience has shown to be so exciting and connected with so many temptations as to be pernicious in tendency both to the individual and to the community it is on this ground that horseracing and circusriding are excluded not because there is any thing positively wrong in having men and horses run and perform feats of agility or in persons looking on for the diversion but because experience has shown so many evils connected with these recreations that they should be relinquished so with theatres the enacting of characters and the amusement thus afforded in itself may be harmless and possibly in certain cases might be useful but experience has shown so many evils to result from this source that it is deemed wrong to patronize it so also with those exciting games of chance which are employed in gambling under the same head comes dancing in the estimation of the great majority of the religious world still there are many intelligent excellent and conscientious persons who hold a contrary opinion such maintain that it is an innocent and healthful amusement tending to promote ease of manners cheerfulness social affection and health of mind and body that evils are involved only in its excess that like food study or religious excitement it is only wrong when not properly regulated and that if serious and intelligent people would strive to regulate rather than banish this amusement much more good would be secured on the other side it is objected not that dancing is a sin in itself considered for it was once a part of sacred worship not that it would be objectionable if it were properly regulated not that it does not tend when used in a proper manner to health of body and mind to grace of manners and to social enjoyment all these things are conceded but it is objected to on the same ground as horseracing cardplaying and theatrical entertainments that we are to look at amusements as they are and not as they might be horseraces might be so managed as not to involve cruelty gambling drunkenness and every other vice and so might theatres and cards and if serious and intelligent persons undertook to patronize these in order to regulate them perhaps they would be somewhat raised from the depths to which they are now sunk but such persons know that with the weak sense of moral obligation existing in the mass of society and the imperfect ideas mankind have of the proper use of amusements and the little selfcontrol which men or women or children practise these will not in fact be thusregulated and they believe dancing to be liable to the same objections as this recreation is actually conducted it does not tend to produce health of body or mind but directly the contrary if young and old went out to dance together in the open air as the french peasants do it would be a very different sort of amusement from that which is witnessed in a room furnished with many lights and filled with guests both expending the healthful part of the atmosphere where the young collect in their tightest dresses to protract for several hours a kind of physical exertion which is not habitual to them during this process the blood is made to circulate more swiftly than ordinary in circumstances where it is less perfectly oxygenized than health requires the pores of the skin are excited by heat and exercise the stomach is loaded with indigestible articles and the quiet needful to digestion withheld the diversion is protracted beyond the usual hour for repose and then when the skin is made the most highly susceptible to damps and miasms the company pass from a warm room to the cold nightair it is probable that no single amusement can be pointed out combining so many injurious particulars as this which is so often defended as a healthful one even if parents who train their children to dance can keep them from public balls which is seldom the case dancing in private parlors is subject to nearly all the same mischievous influences as to the claim of social benefitswhen a dancingparty occupies the parlors and the music begins most of the conversation ceases while the young prepare themselves for future sickness and the old look smilingly on as to the claim for ease and grace of mannersall that is gained by this practice can be better secured by calisthenics which in all its parts embraces a much more perfect system both of healthful exercise graceful movement and pleasing carriage the writer was once inclined to the common opinion that dancing was harmless and might be properly regulated and she allowed a fair trial to be made under her auspices by its advocates the result was a full conviction that it secured no good effect which could not be better gained another way that it involved the most pernicious evils to health character and happiness and that those parents were wise who brought up their children with the full understanding that they were neither to learn nor to practise the art in the fifteen years during which she has had the care of young ladies she has never known any case where learning this art and following the amusement did not have a bad effect either on the habits the intellect the feelings or the health those young ladies who are brought up with less exciting recreations are uniformly likely to be the most contented and most useful while those who enter the path to which this diversion leads acquire a relish and desire for high excitement which make the more steady and quiet pursuits and enjoyments of home comparatively tasteless this the writer believes to be generally the case though not invariably so for there are exceptions to all general rules in reference to these exciting amusements so liable to danger and excess parents are bound to regard the principle which is involved in the petition lead us not into temptation would it not be inconsistent to teach this prayer to the lisping tongue of childhood and then send it to the dancingmaster to acquire a love for a diversion which leads to constant temptations that so few find strength to resist it is encouraging to those who take this view of the subject to find how fast the most serious and intelligent portion of the community is coming to a similar result twentyfive years ago dancing was universally practised by the young as a matter of course in every part of the nation now in those parts of the country where religion and intelligence are most extensively diffused it is almost impossible to get up a ball among the more refined classes of the community the amusement is fast leaving this rank in society to remain as a resource for those whose grade of intelligence and refinement does not relish more elevated recreations still as there is great diversity of opinion among persons of equal worth and intelligence a spirit of candor and courtesy should be practised on both sides the sneer at bigotry and narrowness of views on one side and the uncharitable implication of want of piety or sense on the other are equally illbred and unchristian truth on this subject is best promoted not by illnatured crimination and rebuke but by calm reason generous candor forbearance and kindness there is another species of amusement which a large portion of the religious world have been accustomed to put under the same condemnation as the preceding this is novelreading the confusion and difference of opinion on this subject have arisen from a want of clear and definite distinctions now as it is impossible to define what are novels and what are not so as to include one class of fictitious writings and exclude every other it is impossible to lay down any rule respecting them the discussion in fact turns on the use of those works of imagination which belong to the class of narratives that this species of reading is not only lawful but necessary and useful is settled by divine examples in the parables and allegories of scripture of course the question must be what kind of fabulous writings must be avoided and what allowed in deciding this no specific rules can be given but it must be a matter to be regulated by the nature and circumstances of each case no works of fiction which tend to throw the allurements of taste and genius around vice and crime should ever be tolerated and all that tend to give false views of life and duty should also be banished of those which are written for mere amusement presenting scenes and events that are interesting and exciting and having no bad moral influence much must depend on character and circumstances some minds are torpid and phlegmatic and need to have the imagination stimulated such would be benefitted by this kind of reading others have quick and active imaginations and would be as much injured some persons are often so engaged in absorbing interests that any thing innocent which will for a short time draw off the mind is of the nature of a medicine and in such cases this kind of reading is useful there is need also that some men should keep a supervision of the current literature of the day as guardians to warn others of danger for this purpose it is more suitable for editors clergymen and teachers to read indiscriminately than for any other class of persons for they are the guardians of the public weal in matters of literature and should be prepared to advise parents and young persons of the evils in one direction and the good in another in doing this however they are bound to go on the same principles which regulate physicians when they visit infected districtsusing every precaution to prevent injury to themselves having as little to do with pernicious exposures as a benevolent regard to others will allow and faithfully employing all the knowledge and opportunities thus gained for warning and preserving others there is much danger in taking this course that men will seek the excitement of the imagination for the mere pleasure it affords under the plea of preparing to serve the public when this is neither the aim nor the result in regard to the use of such works by the young as a general rule they ought not to be allowed to any except those of a dull and phlegmatic temperament until the solid parts of education are secured and a taste for more elevated reading is acquired if these stimulating condiments in literature be freely used in youth all relish for more solid reading will in a majority of cases be destroyed if parents succeed in securing habits of cheerful and implicit obedience it will be very easy to regulate this matter by prohibiting the reading of any storybook until the consent of the parent is obtained it is not unfrequently the case that advocates for dancing and the other more exciting amusements speak as if those who were more strict in these matters were aiming to deprive the young of all diversions just as if when cards theatres and dancing are cut off nothing remains but serious and severe duties perhaps there has been some just ground of objection to the course often pursued by parents in neglecting to provide agreeable and suitable substitutes for the amusements denied but there is a great abundance of safe healthful and delightful recreations which all parents may secure for their children some of these will here be pointed out one of the most useful and important is the cultivation of flowers and fruits this especially for the daughters of a family is greatly promotive of health and amusement it is with the hope that many young ladies whose habits are now so formed that they can never be induced to a course of active domestic exercise so long as their parents are able to hire domestics may yet be led to an employment which will tend to secure health and vigor of constitution that so much space is given in this work to directions for the cultivation of fruits and flowers it would be a most desirable improvement if all female schools could be furnished with suitable grounds and instruments for the cultivation of fruits and flowers and every inducement offered to engage the young ladies in this pursuit no father who wishes to have his daughters grow up to be healthful women can take a surer method to secure this end let him set apart a portion of his yard and garden for fruits and flowers and see that the soil is well prepared and dug over and all the rest may be committed to the care of the children these would need to be provided with a light hoe and rake a dibble or garden trowel a wateringpot and means and opportunities for securing seeds roots buds and grafts all which might be done at a trifling expense then with proper encouragement and by the aid of such directions as are contained in this work every man who has even half an acre could secure a small eden around his premises in pursuing this amusement children can also be led to acquire many useful habits early rising would in many cases be thus secured and if they were required to keep their walks and borders free from weeds and rubbish habits of order and neatness would be induced benevolent and social feelings could also be cultivated by influencing children to share their fruits and flowers with friends and neighbors as well as to distribute roots and seeds to those who have not the means of procuring them a woman or a child by giving seeds or slips or roots to a washerwoman or a farmers boy thus exciting them to love and cultivate fruits and flowers awakens a new and refining source of enjoyment in minds which have few resources more elevated than mere physical enjoyments our saviour directs in making feasts to call not the rich who can recompense again but the poor who can make no returns so children should be taught to dispense their little treasures not alone to companions and friends who will probably return similar favors but to those who have no means of making any return if the rich who acquire a love for the enjoyments of taste and have the means to gratify it would aim to extend among the poor the cheap and simple enjoyment of fruits and flowers our country would soon literally blossom as the rose if the ladies of a neighborhood would unite small contributions and send a list of flowerseeds and roots to some respectable and honest florist who would not be likely to turn them off with trash they could divide these among themselves so as to secure an abundant variety at a very small expense a bag of flowerseeds which can be obtained at wholesale for four cents would abundantly supply a whole neighborhood and by the gathering of seeds in the autumn could be perpetuated another very elevating and delightful recreation for the young is found in music here the writer would protest against the common practice in many families of having the daughters learn to play on the piano whether they have a taste and an ear for music or not a young lady who cannot sing and has no great fondness for music does nothing but waste time money and patience in learning to play on the piano but all children can be taught to sing in early childhood if the scientific mode of teaching music in schools could be introduced as it is in prussia germany and switzerland then young children could read and sing music as easily as they can read language and might take any tune dividing themselves into bands and sing off at sight the endless variety of music which is prepared and if parents of wealth would take pains to have teachers qualified for the purpose as they may be at the boston academy and other similar institutions who should teach all the young children in the community much would be done for the happiness and elevation of the rising generation this is an amusement which children relish in the highest degree and which they can enjoy at home in the fields and in visits abroad another domestic amusement is the collecting of shells plants and specimens in geology and mineralogy for the formation of cabinets if intelligent parents would procure the simpler works which have been prepared for the young and study them with their children a taste for such recreations would soon be developed the writer has seen young boys of eight and ten years of age gathering and cleaning shells from rivers and collecting plants and mineralogical specimens with a delight bordering on ecstasy and there are few if any who by proper influences would not find this a source of ceaseless delight and improvement another resource for family diversion is to be found in the various games played by children and in which the joining of older members of the family is always a great advantage to both parties all medical men unite in declaring that nothing is more beneficial to health than hearty laughter and surely our benevolent creator would not have provided risibles and made it a source of health and enjoyment to use them if it were a sin so to do there has been a tendency to asceticism on this subject which needs to be removed such commands as forbid foolish laughing and jesting which are not convenient and which forbid all idle words and vain conversation cannot apply to any thing except what is foolish vain and useless but jokes laughter and sports when used in such a degree as tends only to promote health social feelings and happiness are neither vain foolish nor not convenient it is the excess of these things and not the moderate use of them which scripture forbids the prevailing temper of the mind should be cheerful yet serious but there are times when relaxation and laughter are proper for all there is nothing better for this end than that parents and older persons should join in the sports of childhood mature minds can always make such diversions more entertaining to children and can exert a healthful moral influence over their minds and at the same time can gain exercise and amusement for themselves how lamentable that so many fathers who could be thus useful and happy with their children throw away such opportunities and wear out soul and body in the pursuit of gain or fame another resource for children is in the exercise of mechanical skill fathers by providing tools for their boys and showing them how to make wheelbarrows carts sleds and various other articles contribute both to the physical moral and social improvement of their children and in regard to little daughters much more can be done in this way than many would imagine the writer blessed with the example of a most ingenious and industrious mother had not only learned before the age of twelve to make dolls of various sorts and sizes but to cut and fit and sew every article that belongs to a dolls wardrobe this which was done for mere amusement secured such a facility in mechanical pursuits that ever afterward the cutting and fitting of any article of dress for either sex was accomplished with entire ease when a little girl first begins to sew her mother can promise her a small bed and pillows as soon as she has sewed a patch quilt for them and then a bedstead as soon as she has sewed the sheets and cases for pillows and then a large doll to dress as soon as she has made the under garments and thus go on till the whole contents of the babyhouse are earned by the needle and skill of its little owner thus the task of learning to sew will become a pleasure and every new toy will be earned by useful exertion a little girl can be taught by the aid of patterns prepared for the purpose to cut and fit all articles necessary for her doll she can also be provided with a little washtub and irons to wash and iron and thus keep in proper order a complete miniature domestic establishment besides these recreations there are the enjoyments secured in walking riding visiting and many others which need not be recounted children if trained to be healthful and industrious will never fail to discover resources of amusement while their guardians should lend their aid to guide and restrain them from excess there is need of a very great change of opinion and practice in this nation in regard to the subject of social and domestic duties many sensible and conscientious men spend all their time abroad in business except perhaps an hour or so at night when they are so fatigued as to be unfitted for any social or intellectual enjoyment and some of the most conscientious men in the country will add to their professional business public or benevolent enterprises which demand time effort and money and then excuse themselves for neglecting all care of their children and efforts for their own intellectual improvement or for the improvement of their families by the plea that they have no time for it all this arises from the want of correct notions of the binding obligation of our social and domestic duties the main object of life is not to secure the various gratifications of appetite or taste but to form such a character for ourselves and others as will secure the greatest amount of present and future happiness it is of far more consequence then that parents should be intelligent social affectionate and agreeable at home and to their friends than that they should earn money enough to live in a large house and have handsome furniture it is far more needful for children that a father should attend to the formation of their character and habits and aid in developing their social intellectual and moral nature than it is that he should earn money to furnish them with handsome clothes and a variety of tempting food it will be wise for those parents who find little time to attend to their children or to seek amusement and enjoyment in the domestic and social circle because their time is so much occupied with public cares or benevolent objects to inquire whether their first duty is not to train up their own families to be useful members of society a man who neglects the mind and morals of his children to take care of the public is in great danger of coming under a similar condemnation to that of him who neglecting to provide for his own household has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel there are husbands and fathers who conscientiously subtract time from their business to spend at home in reading with their wives and children and in domestic amusements which at once refresh and improve the children of such parents will grow up with a love of home and kindred which will be the greatest safeguard against future temptations as well as the purest source of earthly enjoyment there are families also who make it a definite object to keep up family attachments after the children are scattered abroad and in some cases secure the means for doing this by saving money which would otherwise have been spent for superfluities of food or dress some families have adopted for this end a practice which if widely imitated would be productive of extensive benefit the method is this on the first day of each month some member of the family at each extreme point of dispersion takes a folio sheet and fills a part of a page this is sealed and mailed to the next family who read it add another contribution and then mail it to the next thus the family circular once a month goes from each extreme to all the members of a widelydispersed family and each member becomes a sharer in the joys sorrows plans and pursuits of all the rest at the same time frequent family meetings are sought and the expense thus incurred is cheerfully met by retrenchments in other directions the sacrifice of some unnecessary physical indulgence such for instance as the use of tea and coffee will often purchase many social and domestic enjoyments a thousand times more elevating and delightful than the retrenched luxury there is no social duty which the supreme lawgiver more strenuously urges than hospitality and kindness to strangers who are classed with the widow and the fatherless as the special objects of divine tenderness there are some reasons why this duty peculiarly demands attention from the american people reverses of fortune in this land are so frequent and unexpected and the habits of the people are so migratory that there are very many in every part of the country who having seen all their temporal plans and hopes crushed are now pining among strangers bereft of wonted comforts without friends and without the sympathy and society so needful to wounded spirits such too frequently sojourn long and lonely with no comforter but him who knoweth the heart of a stranger whenever therefore new comers enter a community inquiry should immediately be made whether they have friends and associates to render sympathy and kind attentions and when there is any need for it the ministries of kind neighborhood should immediately be offered and it should be remembered that the first days of a strangers sojourn are the most dreary and that civility and kindness are doubled in value by being offered at an early period in social gatherings the claims of the stranger are too apt to be forgotten especially in cases where there are no peculiar attractions of personal appearance or talents or high standing such a one should be treated with attention because he is a stranger and when communities learn to act more from principle and less from selfish impulse on this subject the sacred claims of the stranger will be less frequently forgotten the most agreeable hospitality to visiters who become inmates of a family is that which puts them entirely at ease this can never be the case where the guest perceives that the order of family arrangements is essentially altered and that time comfort and convenience are sacrificed for his accommodation offering the best to visiters showing a polite regard to every wish expressed and giving precedence to them in all matters of comfort and convenience can be easily combined with the easy freedom which makes the stranger feel at home and this is the perfection of hospitable entertainment chapter xxiv on the construction of houses there is no point of domestic economy which more seriously involves the health and daily comfort of american women than the proper construction of houses there are five particulars to which attention should be given in building a house namely economy of labor economy of money economy of health economy of comfort and good taste some particulars will here be pointed out under each of these heads the first respects economy of labor in deciding upon the size and style of a house the health and capacity of the housekeeper and the probabilities of securing proper domestics ought to be the very first consideration if a man be uncertain as to his means for hiring service or if he have a feeble wife and be where properlyqualified domestics are scarce it is very poor economy to build a large house or to live in a style which demands much labor every room in a house adds to the expense involved in finishing and furnishing it and to the amount of labor spent in sweeping dusting cleaning floors paint and windows and taking care of and repairing its furniture double the size of a house and you double the labor of taking care of it and so vice versa there is in this country a very great want of calculation and economy in this matter the arrangement of rooms and the proper supply of conveniences are other points in which economy of labor and comfort is often disregarded for example a kitchen will be in one story a sittingroom in another and the nursery in a third nothing is more injurious to a feeble woman than going up and down stairs and yet in order to gain two large parlors to show to a few friends or to strangers immense sacrifices of health comfort and money are made if it be possible the nursery sittingparlor and kitchen ought always to be on the same floor the position of wells and cisterns and the modes of raising and carrying water are other particulars in which economy of labor and comfort is sadly neglected with half the expense usually devoted to a sideboard or sofa the water used from a well or cistern can be so conducted as that by simply turning a cock it will flow to the place where it is to be used a want of economy in labor and in money is often seen in the shape and arrangement of houses and in the style of ornaments and furniture a perfect square encloses more rooms at less expense than any other shape while it has less surface exposed to external cold and can be most easily warmed and ventilated and the farther a house is removed from this shape the more the expense is increased wings and kitchens built out beyond a house very much increase expense both in building and warming them piazzas and porticoes are very expensive and their cost would secure far more comfort if devoted to additional nursery or kitchen conveniences many kinds of porticoes cost as much as one additional room in the house houses can be so constructed that one staircase will answer for both kitchen and parlour use as may be seen in the engraving on page 269 fig 27 this saves the expense and labor usually devoted to a large hall and front staircase much money is often worse than wasted by finical ornaments which are fast going out of fashion one of the largest most beautiful and agreeable houses the writer was ever in was finished with doors windows and fireplaces in even a plainer style than any given in the subsequent drawings the position of fireplaces has much to do with economy of expense in warming a house where the fireplace is in an outer wall one third of the heat passes out of doors which would be retained in the house if the chimney were within the rooms a house contrived like the one represented in the engraving on page 272 fig 32 which can be heated by a stove or chimney at x may be warmed with less fuel than one of any other constructionr economy of health is often disregarded by placing wells cisterns and privies so that persons in the perspiration of labor or the debility of disease are obliged to go out of doors in all weathers figure 35 on page 276 shows the proper arrangement of such conveniences the placing of an outside door for common use in a sittingroom as is frequent at the west and south is detrimental to health in such cases children in their sports or persons who labor are thrown into perspiration by exercise the door is thrown open a chill ensues and fever bowel complaints or bilious attacks are the result a long window extending down to the floor which can be used as a door in summer and be tightly closed at the bottom in winter secures all the benefits without the evils of an outside door constructing houses without open fireplaces in chambers or any other mode of ventilation is another sad violation of the economy of health feeble constitutions in children and ill health to domestics are often caused by this folly the economy of comfort is often violated by arrangements made for domestics many a woman has been left to endure much hard labor and perplexity because she chose to have money spent on handsome parlors and chambers for company which should have been devoted to providing a comfortable kitchen and chambers for domestics cramping the conveniences and comfort of a family in order to secure elegant rooms to show to company is a weakness and folly which it is hoped will every year become less common the construction of houses with reference to good taste is a desirable though less important item the beauty of a house depends very much upon propriety of proportions color and ornament and it is always as cheap and generally cheaper to build a house in agreement with the rules of good taste than to build an awkward and illproportioned one plans of houses and domestic conveniences the following plans are designed chiefly for persons in moderate circumstances and have especial reference to young housekeepers every year as the prosperity of this nation increases good domestics will decrease and young mothers are hereafter to be called to superintend and perform all branches of domestic business to nurse children direct ignorant domestics attend the sick entertain company and fulfil all other family duties and this too in a majority of cases with delicate constitutions or impaired health every man therefore in forming plans for a future residence and every woman who has any influence in deciding such matters ought to make these probabilities the chief basis of their calculationss illustration fig 17 illustration fig 18 groundplan a porch b parlor 15 by 16 feet c diningroom 15 by 16 feet d d small bedrooms e stairs f f f closets g pantry h storecloset i i i

fig 17 is the elevation or the front view of the exterior fig 18 is the groundplan in which an entire break in the wall represents a door and a break with a line across it a window when a cross x is put by a door it indicates into which room the door swings and where the hinges should be put as the comfort of a fireside very much depends on the way in which the doors are hung a scale of measurement is given at the bottom of the drawings by which the size of all parts can be measured the ten small divisions are each one foot the longest divisions are ten feet each in the groundplan fig 18 a is the porch which projects enough to afford an entrance to the two adjacent rooms and thus avoids the evil of an outside door to a sittingroom if a door be wanted in these rooms the front windows can be made to extend down to the floor so as to serve as doors in summer and be tightly closed in winter the parlor b has the bedpress k and the closet f adjoining it figure 19 is intended to represent this side of the room illustration fig 19 scale of feet for the doors the two large doors in the centre open into the bedpress and one of the smaller ones into the closet f the other can either be a false door in order to secure symmetry or else a real one opening into the kitchen j a room thus arranged can be made to serve as a genteel parlor for company during the day when all these doors can be closed at night the doors of the bedpress being opened it is changed to an airy bedroom while the closets f f serve to conceal all accommodations pertaining to a bedroom the bedpress is just large enough to receive a bed and under it if need be might be placed a trucklebed for young children the eatingroom c has the small bedroom d adjoining it which by leaving the door open at night will be sufficiently airy for a sleepingroom the kitchen j has a smaller bedroom d attached to it which will hold a narrow single bed for a domestic and if need be a narrow trucklebed under it for a child the staircase to the garret can either be placed in the eatingroom or in the small entry a plan for back accommodations is shown in fig 35 page 276 these should be placed in the rear of the kitchen so as not to cover the window a house like this will conveniently accommodate a family of six or eight persons but some economy and contrivance will be needed in storing away articles of dress and bedclothing for this end in the bedpress k of the parlor b fig 18 a wide shelf may be placed two feet from the ceiling where winter bedding or folded clothing can be stowed while a short curtain in front hung from the wall will give a tidy look and keep out dust under this shelf if need be pegs can be placed to hold other articles and a curtain be hung from the edge of the shelf to conceal and protect them both the closets f f should have shelves and drawers the garret can have a window inserted in the roof and thus be made serviceable for storage illustration fig 20 figure 20 represents a fireplace and mantelpiece in a style corresponding with the doors such a cottage as this could be built for from five hundred to nine hundred dollars according as the expense of labor in the place and the excellence of the materials and labor may vary illustration fig 21 figures 21 and 22 show the elevation and groundplan of a cottage in which the rooms are rather more agreeably arranged than in the former plan the elevation fig 21 has a piazza running across the whole front this would cost nearly two hundred dollars and for this sum another story might be added an architect told the writer that he could build the twostory house fig 23 and 24 without a piazza for the same sum as this cottage with one this shows the poor economy of these appendages the groundplan fig 22

handsome parlor by day and yet allow it to be used as a bedroom at night the bedpresses in the other rooms can have less expensive doors a window is put in each bedpress to secure proper ventilation these should be opened to air the bed on leaving it these can be fitted up with shelves pegs and curtains as before described if the elevation of the first cottage be preferred to this as being less expensive it can be used by altering it a little thus instead of the projection for the entry make a slight projection of the width of one brick to preserve the same general outside appearance let the windows extend down to the floor and the beauty of symmetry will also be preserved illustration fig 23 groundplan a entry b stairs c parlor 16 by 20 feet d kitchen 14 by 14 feet e storecloset f pantry

parlor e can be taken in which case the closets i i are very useful to prevent noise from reaching the front parlor two sets of foldingdoors each side of the passage o could be placed with this arrangement these rooms could be used sometimes as two parlors opening into each other by folding doors and at other times as a nursery and parlor in this plan the storeroom h and chinacloset i between the kitchen and eatingroom are a great convenience figures 31 and 32 present the plan of a gothic cottage which secures the most economy of labor and expense with the greatest amount of convenience and comfort which the writer has ever seen illustration fig 31 the elevation fig 31 exhibits the front view it has a recess in the central part under which is the door with a window on each side of it this forms a piazza and into this and a similar one at the back of the house the two centre parlors open illustration fig 32 in the centre of the house see fig 32 are the two parlors b and c the back one to be used as an eatingroom at x can be placed either a chimney with doors on each side of the fireplace or which is the most agreeable foldingdoors which can be thrown open in summer thus making a large saloon through the house from one piazza to the other in this case the parlors are warmed by a large stove set near the foldingdoors which would easily warm both parlors and one or two adjacent rooms in winter the outside doors opening to the piazzas should be fastened and calked and the side entry at d be used at e is the nursery with the bedpress g which being closed by day makes a retired parlor for the mother at n is the childrens playroom and sleepingroom adjoining the mothers room at k is the kitchen adjacent to the eatingroom with the storeroom e and the closets m m one for the eatingroom and one for the kitchen utensils at i is a parlor which can be used for a study or library by the master of the family while the adjacent bedpress j renders it a convenient lodgingroom for guests another lodgingroom is at h and in the attic is space enough for several comfortable lodgingrooms a window in the roof on the front and back like the one on wadsworths cottage fig 33 could be placed over the front door to light the chambers in the attic a double roof in the attic with a current of air between secures cool chambers the closets are marked o and the fireplaces p the stairs to the attic are at q by this arrangement the housekeeper has her parlor sleepingroom nursery and kitchen on the same floor while the rooms with bedpresses enable her to increase either parlors or lodgingrooms at pleasure without involving the care of a very large and expensive house figure 33 is the representation of a cottage built by daniel wadsworth esq in the vicinity of hartford connecticut and is on a plan which though much smaller is very similar to the plan represented in fig 32 it serves to show the manner in which the roofs should be arranged in fig 31 which being seen exactly in front does not give any idea of the mode of this arrangement the elevation of wadsworths cottage could be taken for the groundplan shown in fig 32 if it be preferred to the other both this cottage and all the other plans require a woodhouse and the conveniences connected with it which are represented in fig 35 page 276 for these gothic cottages an appendage of this sort should be in keeping with the rest having windows like those in the little summerhouse in the drawing and battlements as on the top of the wings of the barn the ornaments on the front of the cottage and the pillars of the portico made simply of the trunks of small trees give a beautiful rural finish and their expense is trifling in this picture the trees could not be placed as they are in reality because they would hide the buildings illustration fig 33 in arranging yards and grounds the house should be set back as in the drawing of wadsworths cottage and instead of planting shadetrees in straight lines or scattering them about as single trees they should be arranged in clusters with large openings for turf flowers and shrubbery which never flourish well under the shade and dropping of trees this also secures spots of dark and cool shade even when trees are young in arranging shadetrees tastefully around such a place a large cluster might be placed on each side of the gate another on the circular grassplot at the side of the house another at a front corner and another at a back corner shrubbery along the walks and on the circular plot in front and flowers close to the house would look well the barn also should have clusters of trees near it and occasional single trees on the lawn would give the graceful ease and variety seen in nature figure 34 represents the accommodations for

from the lower part of the boiler made of copper or some metal not melted by great heat and at y a cock is placed to draw off hot water then the conductor passes to the bathingtub where is another cock at z the water is let off from the bathingtub by this arrangement great quantities of hot and cold water can be used with no labor in carrying and with very little labor in raising it in case a

is a latticed portico which is cheap and answers all the purposes of a more expensive one it should be solid overhead to turn off the rain and creepers should be trained over it a simple latticed arch over a door covered with creepers is very cheap and serves instead of an expensive portico illustration fig 37 c parlor ceiling k kitchen ceiling fig 37 represents a sliding closet or dumb waiter a convenience which saves much labor when the kitchen is in the basement the two closets should be made wide and broad enough to receive a common waiter the chain or rope which passes over the wheels should branch at x so as to keep the closet from rubbing in its movements when the dishes are not set exactly in the middle or are of unequal weights by this method almost every thing needed to pass between the kitchen and parlor can be sent up and down without any steps if the kitchen is not directly under the eatingroom the sliding closet can be placed in the vicinity of one or both where the place is not wide enough for two closets like these they can be made wider than they are long say one foot and six inches long and three feet wide a strip of wood an inch broad should be fastened on the front and back of the shelves to prevent the dishes from being broken when they are set on carelessly there is nothing which so much improves the appearance of a house and the premises as painting or whitewashing the tenements and fences the following receipts for whitewashing answer the same purpose for wood brick and stone as oilpaint and are much cheaper the first is the receipt used for the presidents house at washington improved by further experiments the second is a cheaper one which the writer has known to succeed in a variety of cases lasting as long and looking as well as white oilpaint receipt take half a bushel of unslacked lime and slack it with boiling water covering it during the process strain it and add a peck of salt dissolved in warm water three pounds of ground rice boiled to a thin paste put in boiling hot half a pound of powdered spanish whiting and a pound of clear glue dissolved in warm water mix and let it stand several days heat it in a kettle on a portable furnace and apply it as hot as possible with a painters or whitewashbrush another make whitewash in the usual way except that the water used should be hot and nearly saturated with salt then stir in four handfuls of fine sand to make it thick like cream coloring matter can be added to both making a light stonecolor a creamcolor or a light buff which are most suitable for buildings footnotes r many houses are now heated by a furnace in the cellar which receives pure air from out of doors heats it and sends it into several rooms while water is evaporated to prevent the air from becoming dry the most perfect one the writer has seen is constructed by mr fowler of hartford this method secures wellventilated rooms and is very economical where several rooms are to be warmed s those who are amateurs in architecture in judging of these designs must take into consideration that this is a work on domestic economy and that matters of taste have necessarily been made subordinate to points involving economy of health comfort and expense still it is believed that good taste has been essentially preserved in most of these designs chapter xxv on fires and lights a shallow fireplace saves wood and gives out more heat than a deeper one a false back of brick may be put up in a deep fireplace hooks for holding up the shovel and tongs a hearthbrush and bellows and brass knobs to hang them on should be furnished to every fireplace an iron bar across the andirons aids in keeping the fire safe and in good order steel furniture is more genteel and more easily kept in order than that made of brass use green wood for logs and mix green and dry wood for the fire and then the woodpile will last much longer walnut maple hickory and oak wood are best chestnut or hemlock is bad because it snaps do not buy a load in which there are many crooked sticks learn how to measure and calculate the solid contents of a load so as not to be cheated have all your wood split and piled under cover for winter have the green wood logs in one pile dry wood in another ovenwood in another kindlings and chips in another and a supply of charcoal to use for broiling and ironing in another place have a brick bin for ashes and never allow them to be put in wood when quitting fires at night never leave a burning stick across the andirons nor on its end without quenching it see that no fire adheres to the broom or brush remove all articles from the fire and have two pails filled with water in the kitchen where they will not freeze stoves and grates rooms heated by stoves should always have some opening for the admission of fresh air or they will be injurious to health the dryness of the air which they occasion should be remedied either by placing a vessel filled with water on the stove or by hooking a long and narrow pan filled with water in front of the grate otherwise the lungs or eyes may be injured a large number of plants in a room prevents this dryness of the air openings for pipes through floors partitions or fireboards should be surrounded by tin to prevent their taking fire lengthening a pipe will increase its draught for those who use anthracite coal that which is broken or screened is best for grates and the nutcoal for small stoves three tons are sufficient in the middle states and four tons in the northern to keep one fire through the winter that which is bright hard and clean is best and that which is soft porous and covered with damp dust is poor it will be well to provide two barrels of charcoal for kindling to every ton of anthracite coal grates for bituminous coal should have a flue nearly as deep as the grate and the bars should be round and not close together the better draught there is the less coaldust is made every grate should be furnished with a poker shovel tongs blower coalscuttle and holder for the blower the latter may be made of woollen covered with old silk and hung near the fire coalstoves should be carefully put up as cracks in the pipe especially in sleeping rooms are dangerous on lights lamps are better than candles as they give a steadier light and do not scatter grease like tallow candles the best oil is clear and nearly colorless winterstrained oil should be used in cold weather lard is a good substitute for oil for astral and other large lamps it is cheaper burns clearer and has a less disagreeable smell it will not burn so well in small lamps as in large ones melt it every morning in an old pitcher kept for the purpose oil long kept grows thick and does not burn well it is therefore best not to buy it in large quantities it should never be left standing in lamps for several days as this spoils it and often injures the lamps camphine is a kind of oil manufactured in new york which does not smell disagreeably nor make greasespots and gives a brighter light than the best oil cleanse the insides of lamps and oilcans with pearlashwater be careful to drain them well and not to let any gilding or bronze be injured by the pearlashwater coming in contact with it put one tablespoonful of pearlash to one quart of water the care of lamps requires so much attention and discretion that many ladies choose to do this work themselves rather than trust it with domestics to do it properly provide the following thingsan old waiter to hold all the articles used a lampfiller with a spout small at the end and turned up to prevent oil from dripping a ball of wickyarn and a basket to hold it a lamptrimmer made for the purpose or a pair of sharp scissors a small soapcup and soap some pearlash in a broadmouthed bottle and several soft cloths to wash the articles and towels to wipe them if every thing after being used is cleansed from oil and then kept neatly it will not be so unpleasant a task as it usually is to take care of lamps wash the shade of an astral lamp once a week and the glass chimney oftener take the lamp to pieces and cleanse it once a month keep dry fingers in trimming lamps to raise the wick of an astral lamp turn it to the right to lower it turn it to the left trim it after it has been once used and in lighting it raise it to the proper height as soon as may be or it will either smoke or form a crust renew the wick when only an inch and a half long closewoven wicks are better than those which are loose dipping wicks in vinegar makes them burn clearer than they otherwise would plain shades do not injure the eyes like cut ones and prints and pictures appear better by them than by the others lamps should be lighted with a strip of folded or rolled paper kept on the mantelpiece weak eyes should always be shaded from the lights small screens made for the purpose should be kept at hand a person with weak eyes can use them safely much longer when they are shaded from the glare of the light than if they are not so fill the entrylamp every day and cleanse and fill nightlanterns twice a week if used often provide small onewicked lamps to carry about and broadbottomed lamps for the kitchen as these are not easily upset a good nightlamp is made with a small onewicked lamp and a roll of tin to set over it have some holes made in the bottom of this cover and it can then be used to heat articles very cheap floating tapers can be bought to burn in a teacup of oil through the night wickyarn drawn repeatedly through melted wax till stiff and smooth makes a good taper for use in sealing letters it can be twined in fanciful forms and kept on the writingtable to make candles the nicest candles are run in moulds for this purpose melt together one quarter of a pound of white wax one quarter of an ounce of camphor two ounces of alum and ten ounces of suet or mutton tallow soak the wicks in limewater and saltpetre and when dry fix them in the moulds and pour in the melted tallow let them remain one night to cool then warm them a little to loosen them draw them out and when hard put them in a box in a dry and cool place to make dipped candles cut the wicks of the right length double them over rods and twist them they should first be dipped in limewater or vinegar and dried melt the tallow in a large kettle filling it to the top with hot water when the tallow is melted put in wax and powdered alum to harden them keep the tallow hot over a portable furnace and fill up the kettle with hot water as fast as the tallow is used up lay two long strips of narrow board on which to hang the rods and set flat pans under on the floor to catch the grease take several rods at once and wet the wicks in the tallow and when cool straighten and smooth them then dip them as fast as they cool until they become of the proper size plunge them obliquely and not perpendicularly and when the bottoms are too large hold them in the hot grease till a part melts off let them remain one night to cool then cut off the bottoms and keep them in a dry cool place cheap lights are made by dipping rushes in tallow chapter xxvi on washing there is nothing which tends more effectually to secure good washing than a full supply of all conveniences and among these none is more important than an abundance of warm and cold water but if this be obtained and heated at a great expense of time and labor it will be used in stinted measure the accommodations described on page 275 fig 34 are very convenient in this respect articles to be provided for washing a plenty of soft water is a very important item when this cannot be had ley or soda can be put in hard water to soften it care being used not to put in so much as to injure the hands and clothes two washforms are needed one for the two tubs in which to put the suds and the other for blueing and starchingtubs four tubs of different sizes are necessary also a large wooden dipper as metal is apt to rust two or three pails a grooved washboard a clothesline seagrass or horsehair is best a washstick to move clothes when boiling and a wooden fork to take them out soapdishes made to hook on the tubs save soap and time provide also a clothesbag in which to boil clothes an indigobag of double flannel a starchstrainer of coarse linen a bottle of oxgall for calicoes a supply of starch neither sour nor musty several dozens of clothespins which are cleft sticks used to fasten clothes on the line a bottle of dissolved gum arabic two clothesbaskets and a brass or copper kettle for boiling clothes as iron is apt to rust a closet for keeping all these things is a great convenience it may be made six feet high three feet deep and four feet wide the tubs and pails can be set on the bottom of this on their sides one within another four feet from the bottom have a shelf placed on which to put the basket of clothespins the line soapdishes dipper and clothesfork above this have another shelf for the bottles boxes c the shelves should reach out only half way from the back and nails should be put at the sides for hanging the washstick clothesbag starchbag and indigobag the ironingconveniences might be kept in the same closet by having the lower shelf raised a little and putting a deep drawer under it to hold the ironingsheets holders c a lock and key should be put on the closet if the mistress of the family requests the washerwoman to notify her when she is through and then ascertains if all these articles are put in their places it will prove useful tubs pails and all hooped wooden ware should be kept out of the sun and in a cool place or they will fall to pieces common mode of washing assort the clothes and put them in soak the night before never pour hot water on them as it sets the dirt in assorting clothes put the flannels in one lot the colored clothes in another the coarse white ones in a third and the fine clothes in a fourth lot wash the fine clothes in one tub of suds and throw them when wrung into another then wash them in the second suds turning them wrong side out put them in the boilingbag and boil them in strong suds for half an hour and not much more move them while boiling with the clothesstick take them out of the boilingbag and put them into a tub of water and rub the dirtiest places again if need be throw them into the rinsingwater and then wring them out and put them into the blueingwater put the articles to be stiffened into a clothesbasket by themselves and just before hanging out dip them in starch clapping it in so as to have them equally stiff in all parts hang white clothes in the sun and colored ones wrong side out in the shade fasten them with clothespins then wash the coarser white articles in the same manner then wash the colored clothes these must not be soaked nor have ley or soda put in the water and they ought not to lie wet long before hanging out as it injures their colors beefsgall one spoonful to two pailfuls of suds improves calicoes lastly wash the flannels in suds as hot as the hand can bear never rub on soap as this shrinks them in spots wring them out of the first suds and throw them into another tub of hot suds turning them wrong side out then throw them into hot blueingwater do not put blueing into suds as it makes specks in the flannel never leave flannels long in water nor put them in cold or lukewarm water before hanging them out shake and stretch them some housekeepers have a close closet made with slats across the top on these slats they put their flannels when ready to hang out and then burn brimstone under them for ten minutes it is but little trouble and keeps the flannels as white as new wash the colored flannels and hose after the white adding more hot water some persons dry woollen hose on stockingboards shaped like a foot and leg with strings to tie them on the line this keeps them from shrinking and makes them look better than if ironed it is also less work than to iron them properly bedding should be washed in long days and in hot weather pound blankets in two different tubs or barrels of hot suds first well mixing the soap and water rinse in hot suds and after wringing let two persons shake them thoroughly and then hang them out if not dry at night fold them and hang them out the next morning bedquilts should be pounded in warm suds and after rinsing be wrung as dry as possible bolsters and pillows can be pounded in hot suds without taking out the feathers rinsing them in fair water it is usually best however for nice feathers to take them out wash them and dry them on a garret floor cotton comforters should have the cases taken off and washed wash bedticks after the feathers are removed like other things empty straw beds once a year the following cautions in regard to calicoes are useful never wash them in very warm water and change the water when it appears dingy or the light parts will look dirty never rub on soap but remove grease with french chalk starch magnesia or wilmington clay make starch for them with coffeewater to prevent any whitish appearance glue is good for stiffening calicoes when laid aside not to be used all stiffening should be washed out or they will often be injured never let calicoes freeze in drying some persons use branwater four quarts of wheatbran to two pails of water and no soap for calicoes washing and rinsing in the branwater potatowater is equally good take eight peeled and grated potatoes to one gallon of water sodawashing a very great saving in labor is secured by sodawashing there have been mistakes made in receipts and in modes of doing it which have caused a prejudice against it but if the soap be rightly made and rightly used it certainly saves one half the labor and time of ordinary washing receipt for sodasoap take eight pounds of barsoap eight pounds of coarse soda the subcarbonate ten gallons of soft water boiled two hours stirring it often this is to be cooled and set away for use in washing take a pound of this soap to the largest pail of water and heat till it boils having previously soaked the white clothes in warm not hot water put them in this boiling mixture and let them boil one hour and no more take them out draining them well and put them in a tub half full of soft water turn them wrong side out rub the soiled places till they look clean then put them into blue rinsingwater and wring them out they are then ready to hang out some persons use another rinsingwater the colored clothes and flannels must not be washed in this way the fine clothes may be first boiled in this water it may then be used for coarser clothes and afterward the brown towels and other articles of that nature may be boiled in the same water after this the water which remains is still useful for washing floors and then the suds is a good manure to put around plants it is best to prepare at once the whole quantity of water to be used take out about one third and set it by and every time a fresh supply of clothes is put in use a portion of this to supply the waste of a former boiling modes of washing various articles brown linens or muslins of tea drab or olive colors look best washed in haywater put in hay enough to color the water like new brown linen wash them first in lukewarm fair water without soap removing grease with french chalk then wash and rinse them in the haywater nankeens look best washed in suds with a teacup of ley added for each pailful iron on the wrong side soak new nankeens in ley for one night and it sets the color perfectly woollen tablecovers and woollen shawls may be washed thus remove grease as before directed if there be stains in the articles take them out with spirits of hartshorn wash the things in two portions of hot suds made of white soap do not wring them but fold them and press the water out catching it in a tub under a table shake stretch and dry neither by the sun nor a fire and do not let them freeze in drying sprinkle them three hours before ironing and fold and roll them tight iron them heavily on the wrong side woollen yarn should be washed in very hot water putting in a teacupful of ley and no soap to half a pailful of water rinse till the water comes off clear new black worsted and woollen hose should be soaked all night and washed in hot suds with beefsgall a tablespoonful to half a pail of water rinse till no color comes out iron on the wrong side to cleanse gentlemens broadcloths the common mode is to shake and brush the articles and rip out linings and pockets then to wash them in strong suds adding a teacupful of ley using white soap for light cloth rolling and then pressing instead of wringing them when dry sprinkling them and letting them lie all night and ironing on the wrong side or with a thin dark cloth over the article until perfectly dry but a far better way which the writer has repeatedly tried with unfailing success is the following take one beefsgall half a pound of salratus and four gallons of warm water lay the article on a table and scour it thoroughly in every part with a clothesbrush dipped in this mixture the collar of a coat and the greasespots previously marked by stitches of white thread must be repeatedly brushed then take the article and rinse it up and down in the mixture then rinse it up and down in a tub of soft cold water then without wringing or pressing hang it to drain and dry fasten a coat up by the collar when perfectly dry it is sometimes the case with coats that nothing more is needed in other cases it is necessary to dampen the parts which look wrinkled with a sponge and either pull them smooth with the fingers or press them with an iron having a piece of bombazine or thin woollen cloth between the iron and the article to manufacture ley soap starch and other articles used in washing to make ley provide a large tub made of pine or ash and set it on a form so high that a tub can stand under it make a hole an inch in diameter near the bottom on one side lay bricks inside about this hole and straw over them to every seven bushels of ashes add two gallons of unslacked lime and throw in the ashes and lime in alternate layers while putting in the ashes and lime pour on boiling water using three or four pailfuls after this add a pailful of cold soft water once an hour till all the ashes appear to be well soaked catch the drippings in a tub and try its strength with an egg if the egg rise so as to show a circle as large as a ten cent piece the strength is right if it rise higher the ley must be weakened by water if not so high the ashes are not good and the whole process must be repeated putting in fresh ashes and running the weak ley through the new ashes with some additional water quickley is made by pouring one gallon of boiling soft water on three quarts of ashes and straining it oak ashes are best to make softsoap save all drippings and fat melt them and set them away in cakes some persons keep for soapgrease a half barrel with weak ley in it and a cover over it to make softsoap take the proportion of one pailful of ley to three pounds of fat melt the fat and pour in the ley by degrees boil it steadily through the day till it is ropy if not boiled enough on cooling it will turn to ley and sediment while boiling there should always be a little oil on the surface if this does not appear add more grease if there is too much grease on cooling it will rise and can be skimmed off try it by cooling a small quantity when it appears like gelly on becoming cold it is done it must then be put in a cool place and often stirred to make cold softsoap melt thirty pounds of grease put it in a barrel add four pailfuls of strong ley and stir it up thoroughly then gradually add more ley till the barrel is nearly full and the soap looks about right to make potashsoap melt thirtynine pounds of grease and put it in a barrel take twentynine pounds of light ashcolored potash the reddishcolored will spoil the soap and pour hot water on it then pour it off into the grease stirring it well continue thus till all the potash is melted add one pailful of cold water stirring it a great deal every day till the barrel be full and then it is done this is the cheapest and best kind of soap it is best to sell ashes and buy potash the soap is better if it stand a year before it is used therefore make two barrels at once to make hard white soap take fifteen pounds of lard or suet and when boiling add slowly five gallons of ley mixed with one gallon of water cool a small portion and if no grease rise it is done if grease do rise add ley and boil till no grease rises then add three quarts of fine salt and boil it if this do not harden well on cooling add more salt cool it and if it is to be perfumed melt it next day put in the perfume and then run it in moulds or cut it in cakes common hard soap is made in the same way by using common fat to manufacture starch cleanse a peck of unground wheat and soak it for several days in soft water when quite soft remove the husks with the hand and the soft parts will settle pour off the water and replace it every day with that which is fresh stirring it well when after stirring and settling the water is clear it is done then strain off the water and dry the starch for several days in the sun if the water be permitted to remain too long it sours and the starch is poor if the starch be not well dried it grows musty chapter xxvii on starching ironing and cleansing to prepare starch take four tablespoonfuls of starch put in as much water and rub it till all lumps are removed then add half a cup of cold water pour this into a quart of boiling water and boil it for half an hour adding a piece of spermaceti or a lump of salt or sugar as large as a hazelnut strain it and put in a very little blueing thin it with hot water glue and gumstarch put a piece of glue four inches square into three quarts of water boil it and keep it in a bottle corked up dissolve four ounces of gum arabic in a quart of hot water and set it away in a bottle corked use the glue for calicoes and the gum for silks and muslins both to be mixed with water at discretion beefsgall send a junkbottle to the butcher and have several gallbladders emptied into it keep it salted and in a cool place some persons perfume it but fresh air removes the unpleasant smell which it gives when used for clothes directions for starching muslins and laces many ladies clap muslins then dry them and afterwards sprinkle them this saves time others clap them till nearly dry then fold and cover and then iron them iron wrought muslins on soft flannel and on the wrong side to do up laces nicely sew a clean piece of muslin around a long bottle and roll the lace on it pulling out the edge and rolling it so that the edge will turn in and be covered as you roll fill the bottle with water and then boil it for an hour in a suds made with white soap rinse it in fair water a little blued dry it in the sun and if any stiffening is wished use thin starch or gum arabic when dry fold and press it between white papers in a large book it improves the lace to wet it with sweetoil after it is rolled on the bottle and before boiling in the suds blond laces can be whitened by rolling them on a bottle in this way and then setting the bottle in the sun in a dish of cold suds made with white soap wetting it thoroughly and changing the suds every day do this for a week or more then rinse in fair water dry it on the bottle in the sun and stiffen it with white gum arabic lay it away in loose folds lace veils can be whitened by laying them in flat dishes in suds made with white soap then rinsing and stiffening them with gum arabic stretching them and pinning them on a sheet to dry on ironing articles to be provided for ironing a settee or settle made so that it can be used for an ironingtable is a great convenience it may be made of pine and of the following dimensions length five feet and six inches width of the seat one foot and nine inches height of the seat one foot and three inches height of the sides or arms of the seat two feet and four inches height of the back five feet and three inches the back should be made with hinges of the height of the sides or arms so that it can be turned down and rest on them and thus become an ironingtable the back is to be fastened up behind with long iron hooks and staples the seat should be made with two lids opening into two boxes or partitions in one of which can be kept the ironingsheets and holders and in the other the other articles used in ironing it can be stained of a cherrycolor put on casters so as to move easily and be provided with two cushions stuffed with hay and covered with dark woollen it thus serves as a comfortable seat for winter protecting the back from cold where a settee of this description is not provided a large ironingboard made so as not to warp should be kept and used only for this purpose to be laid when used on a table provide also the following articles a woollen ironingblanket and a linen or cotton sheet to spread over it a large fire of charcoal and hard wood unless furnaces or stoves are used a hearth free from cinders and ashes a piece of sheetiron in front of the fire on which to set the irons while heating this last saves many black spots from careless ironers three or four holders made of woollen and covered with old silk as these do not easily take fire two iron rings or ironstands on which to set the irons and small pieces of board to put under them to prevent scorching the sheet linen or cotton wipers and a piece of beeswax to rub on the irons when they are smoked there should be at least three irons for each person ironing and a small and large clothesframe on which to air the fine and coarse clothes a bosomboard on which to iron shirtbosoms should be made one foot and a half long and nine inches wide and covered with white flannel a skirtboard on which to iron frockskirts should be made five feet long and two feet wide at one end tapering to one foot and three inches wide at the other end this should be covered with flannel and will save much trouble in ironing nice dresses the large end may be put on the table and the other on the back of a chair both these boards should have cotton covers made to fit them and these should be changed and washed when dirty these boards are often useful when articles are to be ironed or pressed in a chamber or parlor provide also a pressboard for broadcloth two feet long and four inches wide at one end tapering to three inches wide at the other a flutingiron called also a patent italian iron saves much labor in ironing ruffles neatly a crimpingiron will crimp ruffles beautifully with very little time or trouble care must be used with the latter or it will cut the ruffles a trial should be made with old muslins and when the iron is screwed in the right place it must be so kept and not altered without leave from the housekeeper if the lady of the house will provide all these articles see that the fires are properly made the ironingsheets evenly put on and properly pinned the clothesframes dusted and all articles kept in their places she will do much towards securing good ironing on sprinkling folding and ironing wipe the dust from the ironingboard and lay it down to receive the clothes which should be sprinkled with clear water and laid in separate piles one of colored one of common and one of fine articles and one of flannels fold the fine things and roll them in a towel and then fold the rest turning them all right side outward the colored clothes should be laid separate from the rest and ought not to lie long damp as it injures the colors the sheets and table linen should be shaken stretched and folded by two persons iron lace and needlework on the wrong side and carry them away as soon as dry iron calicoes with irons which are not very hot and generally on the right side as they thus keep clean for a longer time in ironing a frock first do the waist then the sleeves then the skirt keep the skirt rolled while ironing the other parts and set a chair to hold the sleeves while ironing the skirt unless a skirtboard be used in ironing a shirt first do the back then the sleeves then the collar and bosom and then the front iron silk on the wrong side when quite damp with an iron which is not very hot light colors are apt to change and fade iron velvet by turning up the face of the iron and after dampening the wrong side of the velvet draw it over the face of the iron holding it straight and not biased chapter xxviii on whitening cleansing and dyeing to whiten articles and remove stains from them wet white clothes in suds and lay them on the grass in the sun lay muslins in suds made with white soap in a flat dish set this in the sun changing the suds every day whiten towcloth or brown linen by keeping it in ley through the night laying it out in the sun and wetting it with fair water as fast as it dries scorched articles can often be whitened again by laying them in the sun wet with suds where this does not answer put a pound of white soap in a gallon of milk and boil the article in it another method is to chop and extract the juice from two onions and boil this with half a pint of vinegar an ounce of white soap and two ounces of fullers earth spread this when cool on the scorched part and when dry wash it off in fair water mildew may be removed by dipping the article in sour buttermilk laying it in the sun and after it is white rinsing it in fair water soap and chalk are also good also soap and starch adding half as much salt as there is starch together with the juice of a lemon stains in linen can often be removed by rubbing on soft soap then putting on a starch paste and drying in the sun renewing it several times wash off all the soap and starch in cold fair water mixtures for removing stains and grease stainmixture half an ounce of oxalic acid in a pint of soft water this can be kept in a corked bottle and is infallible in removing ironrust and inkstains it is very poisonous the article must be spread with this mixture over the steam of hot water and wet several times this will also remove indelible ink the article must be washed or the mixture will injure it another stainmixture is made by mixing one ounce of sal ammoniac one ounce of salt of tartar and one pint of soft water to remove grease mix four ounces of fullers earth half an ounce of pearlash and lemonjuice enough to make a stiff paste which can be dried in balls and kept for use wet the greased spot with cold water rub it with the ball dry it and then rinse it with fair cold water this is for white articles for silks and worsteds use french chalk which can be procured of the apothecaries that which is soft and white is best scrape it on the greased spot and let it lie for a day and night then renew it till the spot disappears wilmington clayballs are equally good inkspots can often be removed from white clothes by rubbing on common tallow leaving it for a day or two and then washing as usual grease can be taken out of wallpaper by making a paste of potters clay water and oxgall and spreading it on the paper when dry renew it till the spot disappears stains on floors from soot or stovepipes can be removed by washing the spot in sulphuric acid and water stains in colored silk dresses can often be removed by pure water those made by acids tea wine and fruits can often be removed by spirits of hartshorn diluted with an equal quantity of water sometimes it must be repeated several times tar pitch and turpentine can be removed by putting the spot in sweetoil or by spreading tallow on it and letting it remain for twentyfour hours then if the article be linen or cotton wash it as usual if it be silk or worsted rub it with ether or spirits of wine lampoil can be removed from floors carpets and other articles by spreading upon the stain a paste made of fullers earth or potters clay and renewing it when dry till the stain is removed if gall be put into the paste it will preserve the colors from injury when the stain has been removed carefully brush off the paste with a soft brush oilpaint can be removed by rubbing it with very pure spirits of turpentine the impure spirit leaves a greasespot wax can be removed by scraping it off and then holding a redhot poker near the spot spermaceti may be removed by scraping it off then putting a paper over the spot and applying a warm iron if this does not answer rub on spirits of wine inkstains in carpets and woollen tablecovers can be removed by washing the spot in a liquid composed of one teaspoonful of oxalic acid dissolved in a teacupful of warm not hot water and then rinsing in cold water stains on varnished articles which are caused by cups of hot water can be removed by rubbing them with lampoil and then with alcohol inkstains can be taken out of mahogany by one teaspoonful of oil of vitriol mixed with one tablespoonful of water or by oxalic acid and water these must be brushed over quickly and then washed off with milk modes of cleansing various articles silk handkerchiefs and ribands can be cleansed by using french chalk to take out the grease and then sponging them on both sides with lukewarm fair water stiffen them with gum arabic and press them between white paper with an iron not very hot a tablespoonful of spirits of wine to three quarts of water improves it silk hose or silk gloves should be washed in warm suds made with white soap and rinsed in cold water they should then be stretched and rubbed with a hardrolled flannel till they are quite dry ironing them very much injures their looks washleather articles should have the grease removed from them by french chalk or magnesia they should then be washed in warm suds and rinsed in cold water white kid gloves should have the grease removed from them as above directed they should then be brushed with a soft brush and a mixture of fullers earth and magnesia in an hour after rub them with flannel dipped in bran and powdered whiting colored or hoskins gloves can be cleansed very nicely by pure spirits of turpentine put on with a woollen cloth and rubbed from wrist to fingers hang them for several days in the air and all the unpleasant smell will be removed gentlemens white gloves should be washed with a sponge in whitesoapsuds then wiped and dried on the hands swansdown tippets and capes should be washed in whitesoapsuds squeezing and not rubbing them then rinse them in two waters and shake and stretch them while drying ostrich feathers can also be thus washed stiffen them with starch wet in cold water and not boiled shake them in the air till nearly dry then hold them before the fire and curl them with dull scissors giving each fibre a twitch turning it inward and holding it so for a moment straw and leghorn hats can be cleansed by simply washing them in whitesoapsuds remove grease by french chalk and stains by diluted oxalic acid or cream of tartar the oxalic acid is best but must be instantly washed off to whiten them drive nails in a barrel near its bottom so that cords can be stretched across on these cords tie the bonnet wet with suds having first removed the grease stains and dirt then invert the barrel over a dish of coals on which roll brimstone is slowly burning put a chip under one side of the barrel to admit the air continue this till the bonnet is white then hang it in the air when the weather is not damp till the smell is removed then stiffen it with a solution of isinglass or gum arabic put on the inside with a sponge press the crown on a block and the rest on a board on the right side putting muslin between the iron and straw and pressing hard be careful not to make it too stiff first stiffen a small piece for trial on coloring precautions and preparations all the articles must be entirely free from grease or oil and also in most cases from soapsuds make light dyes in brass and dark ones in iron vessels always wet the articles in fair water before dyeing always carefully strain the dye if the color be too light dry and then dip the article again stir the article well in the dye lifting it up often remove any previous color by boiling in suds or what is better in the soda mixture used for washing pink dye buy a saucer of carmine at an apothecarys with it you will find directions for its use this is cheap easy to use and beautiful balm blossoms and bergamot blossoms with a little cream of tartar in the water make a pretty pink red dye take half a pound of wheat bran three ounces of powdered alum and two gallons of soft water boil these in a brass vessel and add an ounce of cream of tartar and an ounce of cochineal tied up together in a bag boil the mixture for fifteen minutes

should be darker than the walls and if the walls and carpets be light the chairs should be dark and vice versa pictures always look best on light walls in selecting carpets for rooms much used it is poor economy to buy cheap ones ingrain carpets of close texture and the threeply carpets are best for common use brussels carpets do not wear so long as the threeply ones because they cannot be turned wilton carpets wear badly and venetians are good only for halls and stairs in selecting colors avoid those in which there are any black threads as they are always rotten the most tasteful carpets are those which are made of various shades of the same color or of all shades of only two colors such as brown and yellow or blue and buff or salmon and green or all shades of green or of brown all very dark shades should be brown or green but not black in laying down carpets it is a bad practice to put straw under them as this makes them wear out in spots straw matting laid under carpets makes them last much longer as it is smooth and even and the dust sifts through it in buying carpets always get a few yards over to allow for waste in matching figures in cutting carpets make them three or four inches shorter than the room to allow for stretching begin to cut in the middle of a figure and it will usually match better many carpets match in two different ways and care must be taken to get the right one sew a carpet on the wrong side with double waxed thread and with the ballstitch this is done by taking a stitch on the breadth next you pointing the needle towards you and then taking a stitch on the other breadth pointing the needle from you draw the thread tightly but not so as to pucker in fitting a breadth to the hearth cut slits in the right place and turn the piece under bind the whole of the carpet with carpetbinding nail it with tacks having bits of leather under the heads to stretch the carpet use a carpetfork which is a long stick ending with notched tin like sawteeth this is put in the edge of the carpet and pushed by one person while the nail is driven by another cover blocks or bricks with carpeting like that of the room and put them behind tables doors sofas c to preserve the walls from injury by knocking or by the dustingcloth cheap footstools made of a square plank covered with towcloth stuffed and then covered with carpeting with worsted handles look very well sweep carpets as seldom as possible as it wears them out to shake them often is good economy in cleaning carpets use damp tea leaves or wet indian meal throwing it about and rubbing it over with the broom the latter is very good for cleansing carpets made dingy by coaldust in brushing carpets in ordinary use it will be found very convenient to use a large flat dustpan with a perpendicular handle a yard high put on so that the pan will stand alone this can be carried about and used without stooping brushing dust into it with a common broom the pan must be very large or it will be upset when carpets are taken up they should be hung on a line or laid on long grass and whipped first on one side and then on the other with pliant whips if laid aside they should be sewed up tight in linen having snuff or tobacco put along all the crevices where moths could enter shaking pepper from a pepperbox round the edge of the floor under a carpet prevents the access of moths carpets can be best washed on the floor thus first shake them and then after cleaning the floor stretch and nail them upon it then scrub them in cold soapsuds having half a teacupful of oxgall to a bucket of water then wash off the suds with a cloth in fair water set open the doors and windows for two days or more imperial brussels venetian ingrain and threeply carpets can be washed thus but wilton and other plushcarpets cannot before washing them take out grease with a paste made of potters clay oxgall and water straw matting is best for chambers and summer parlors the checked of two colors is not so good to wear the best is the cheapest in the end when washed it should be done with salt water wiping it dry but frequent washing injures it bind matting with cotton binding sew breadths together like carpeting in joining the ends of pieces ravel out a part and tie the threads together turning under a little of each piece and then laying the ends close nail them down with nails having kid under their heads in hanging pictures put them so that the lower part shall be opposite the eye cleanse the glass of pictures with whiting as water endangers the pictures gilt frames can be much better preserved by putting on a coat of copal varnish which with proper brushes can be bought of carriage or cabinetmakers when dry it can be washed with fair water wash the brush in spirits of turpentine curtains ottomans and sofas covered with worsted can be cleansed by wheatbran rubbed on with flannel dust venetian blinds with feather brushes buy lightcolored ones as the green are going out of fashion strips of linen or cotton on rollers and pulleys are much in use to shut out the sun from curtains and carpets paper curtains pasted on old cotton are good for chambers put them on rollers having cords nailed to them so that when the curtain falls the cord will be wound up then by pulling the cord the curtain will be rolled up mahogany furniture should be made in the spring and stand some months before it is used or it will shrink and warp varnished furniture should be rubbed only with silk except occasionally when a little sweetoil should be rubbed over and wiped off carefully for unvarnished furniture use beeswax a little softened with sweetoil rub it in with a hard brush and polish with woollen and silk rags some persons rub in linseedoil others mix beeswax with a little spirits of turpentine and rosin making it so that it can be put on with a sponge and wiped off with a soft rag others keep in a bottle the following mixture two ounces of spirits of turpentine four tablespoonfuls of sweetoil and one quart of milk this is applied with a sponge and wiped off with a linen rag hearths and jambs of brick look best painted over with blacklead mixed with softsoap wash the bricks which are nearest the fire with redding and milk using a painters brush a sheet of zinc covering the whole hearth is cheap saves work and looks very well a tinman can fit it properly stone hearths should be rubbed with a paste of powdered stone to be procured of the stonecutters and then brushed with a stiff brush kitchenhearths of stone are improved by rubbing in lampoil stains can be removed from marble by oxalic acid and water or oil of vitriol and water left on fifteen minutes and then rubbed dry gray marble is improved by linseedoil grease can be taken from marble by oxgall and potters clay wet with soapsuds a gill of each it is better to add also a gill of spirits of turpentine it improves the looks of marble to cover it with this mixture leaving it two days and then rubbing it off unless a parlor is in constant use it is best to sweep it only once a week and at other times use a whiskbroom and dustpan when a parlor with handsome furniture is to be swept cover the sofas centre table piano books and mantelpiece with old cottons kept for the purpose remove the rugs and shake them and clean the jambs hearth and firefurniture then sweep the room moving every article dust the furniture with a dustbrush and a piece of old silk a painters brush should be kept to remove dust from ledges and crevices the dustcloths should be often shaken and washed or else they will soil the walls and furniture when they are used dust ornaments and fine books with feather brushes kept for the purpose chapter xxx on the care of breakfast and diningrooms an eatingroom should have in it a large closet with drawers and shelves in which should be kept all the articles used at meals this if possible should communicate with the kitchen by a sliding window or by a door and have in it a window and also a small sink made of marble or lined with zinc which will be a great convenience for washing nice articles if there be a dumbwaiter it is best to have it connected with such a closet it may be so contrived that when it is down it shall form part of the closet floor a tablerug or crumbcloth is useful to save carpets from injury bocking or baize is best always spread the same side up or the carpet will be soiled by the rug tablemats are needful to prevent injury to the table from the warm dishes teacupmats or small plates are useful to save the tablecloths from dripping tea or coffee butterknives for the butterplate and saltspoons for saltdishes are designed to prevent those disgusting marks which are made when persons use their own knives to take salt or butter a sugarspoon should be kept in or by the sugardish for the same purpose tablenapkins of diaper are often laid by each persons plate for use during the meal to save the tablecloth and pockethandkerchief to preserve the same napkin for the same person each member of the family has a given number and the napkins are numbered to correspond or else are slipped into ivory rings which are numbered a stranger has a clean one at each meal tablecloths should be well starched and ironed on the right side and always when taken off folded in the ironed creases doilies are colored napkins which when fruit is offered should always be furnished to prevent a person from staining a nice handkerchief or permitting the fruitjuice to dry on the fingers casters and saltstands should be put in order every morning when washing the breakfast things always if possible provide fine and dry tablesalt as many persons are much disgusted with that which is dark damp and coarse be careful to keep saladoil closely corked or it will grow rancid never leave the saltspoons in the salt nor the mustardspoon in the mustard as they are thereby injured wipe them immediately after the meal for tablefurniture french china is deemed the nicest but it is liable to the objection of having plates so made that salt butter and similar articles will not lodge on the edge but slip into the centre select knives and forks which have weights in the handles so that when laid down they will not touch the table those with rivetted handles last longer than any others horn handles except buckhorn are very poor the best are cheapest in the end knives should be sharpened once a month unless they are kept sharp by the mode of scouring on setting tables neat housekeepers observe the manner in which a table is set more than any thing else and to a person of good taste few things are more annoying than to see the table placed askew the tablecloth soiled rumpled and put on awry the plates knives and dishes thrown about without any order the pitchers soiled on the outside and sometimes within the tumblers dim the caster out of order the butter pitched on the plate without any symmetry the salt coarse damp and dark the bread cut in a mixture of junks and slices the dishes of food set on at random and without mats the knives dark or rusty and their handles greasy the teafurniture all out of order and every thing in similar style and yet many of these negligences will be met with at the tables of persons who call themselves well bred and who have wealth enough to make much outside show one reason for this is the great difficulty of finding domestics who will attend to these things in a proper manner and who after they have been repeatedly instructed will not neglect nor forget what has been said to them the writer has known cases where much has been gained by placing the following rules in plain sight in the place where the articles for setting tables are kept rules for setting a table 1 lay the rug square with the room and also smooth and even then set the table also square with the room and see that the legs are in the right position to support the leaves 2 lay the tablecloth square with the table right side up smooth and even 3 put on the teatray for breakfast or tea square with the table set the cups and saucers at the front side of the teatray and the sugar slopbowls and creamcup at the back side lay the sugarspoon or tongs on the sugarbowl 4 lay the plates around the table at equal intervals and the knives and forks at regular distances each in the same particular manner with a cupmat or cupplate to each and a napkin at the right side of each person 5 if meat be used set the caster and saltcellars in the centre of the table then lay mats for the dishes and place the carvingknife and fork and steel by the master of the house set the butter on two plates one on either side with a butterknife by each 6 set the tea or coffeepot on a mat at the right hand of the teatray if there be not room upon it then place the chairs around the table and call the family for dinner 1 place the rug table tablecloth plates knives and forks and napkins as before directed with a tumbler by each plate in cold weather set the plates where they will be warmed 2 put the caster in the centre and the saltstands at two oblique corners of the table the latter between two large spoons crossed if more spoons be needed lay them on each side of the caster crossed set the pitcher on a mat either at a sidetable or when there is no waiter on the diningtable water looks best in glass decanters 3 set the bread on the table when there is no waiter some take a fork and lay a piece on the napkin or tumbler by each plate others keep it in a tray covered with a white napkin to keep off flies bread for dinner is often cut in small junks and not in slices 4 set the principal dish before the master of the house and the other dishes in a regular manner put the carvingknife fork and steel by the principal dish and also a kniferest if one be used 5 put a small knife and fork by the pickles and also by any other dishes which need them then place the chairs on waiting at table a domestic who waits on the table should be required to keep the hair and hands in neat order and have on a clean apron a small teatray should be used to carry cups and plates the waiter should announce the meal when ready to the mistress of the family then stand by the eatingroom door till all are in then close the door and step to the left side of the lady of the house when all are seated the waiter should remove the covers taking care first to invert them so as not to drop the steam on the tablecloth or guests in presenting articles go to the left side of the person in pouring water never entirely fill the tumbler the waiter should notice when bread or water is wanting and hand it without being called when plates are changed be careful not to drop knives or forks brush off crumbs with a crumbbrush into a small waiter when there is no domestic waiter a light table should be set at the left side of the mistress of the house on which the bread water and other articles not in immediate use can be placed on carving and helping at table it is considered an accomplishment for a lady to know how to carve well at her own table it is not proper to stand in carving the carvingknife should be sharp and thin to carve fowls which should always be laid with the breast uppermost place the fork in the breast and take off the wings and legs without turning the fowl then cut out the merry thought cut slices from the breast take out the collar bone cut off the side pieces and then cut the carcass in two divide the joints in the leg of a turkey in helping the guests when no choice is expressed give a piece of both the white and dark meat with some of the stuffing inquire whether the guest will be helped to each kind of vegetable and put the gravy on the plate and not on any article of food in carving a sirloin cut thin slices from the side next to you it must be put on the dish with the tenderloin underneath then turn it and cut from the tenderloin help the guest to both kinds in carving a leg of mutton or a ham begin by cutting across the middle to the bone cut a tongue across and not lengthwise and help from the middle part carve a forequarter of lamb by separating the shoulder from the ribs and then dividing the ribs to carve a loin of veal begin at the smaller end and separate the ribs help each one to a piece of the kidney and its fat carve pork and mutton in the same way to carve a fillet of veal begin at the top and help to the stuffing with each slice in a breast of veal separate the breast and brisket and then cut them up asking which part is preferred in carving a pig it is customary to divide it and take off the head before it comes to the table as to many persons the head is very revolting cut off the limbs and divide the ribs in carving venison make a deep incision down to the bone to let out the juices then turn the broad end of the haunch towards you cutting deep in thin slices for a saddle of venison cut from the tail towards the other end on each side in thin slices warm plates are very necessary with venison and mutton and in winter are desirable for all meats chapter xxxi on the care of chambers and bedrooms every mistress of a family should see not only that all sleepingrooms in her house can be well ventilated at night but that they actually are so where there is no open fireplace to admit the pure air from the exterior a door should be left open into an entry or room where fresh air is admitted or else a small opening should be made in a window taking care not to allow a draught of air to cross the bed the debility of childhood the lassitude of domestics and the illhealth of families are often caused by neglecting to provide a supply of pure air straw matting is best for a chamber carpet and strips of woollen carpeting may be laid by the side of the bed where chambers have no closets a wardrobe is indispensable this is a moveable closet with doors divided by a perpendicular partition into two apartments in one division rows of hooks are placed on which to hang dresses the other division is fitted up with shelves for other uses some are made with drawers at the bottom for shoes and such like articles a low square box set on casters with a cushion on the top and a drawer on one side to put shoes in is a great convenience in dressing the feet an old champaigne basket fitted up with a cushion on the lid and a valance fastened to it to cover the sides can be used for the same purpose a comfortable couch for chambers and sittingrooms can be made by a common carpenter at a small expense have a frame made like the annexed engraving fig 38 of common stuff six feet long twentyeight inches wide and twelve inches high it must be made thus low because the casters and cushions will raise it several inches have the sloping sidepiece a and headpiece b sawed out of a board nail brown linen on them and stuff them with soft hay or hair let these be screwed to the frame and covered with furniture patch then let slats be nailed across the bottom as at c c four inches apart this will cost two or three dollars then make a thick cushion of hay or straw with side strips like a mattress and lay this for the undercushion to put over this make a thinner cushion of hair cover it with furniturecalico and fasten to it a valance reaching to the floor then make two square pillows and cover them with calico like the rest both the cushions should be stitched through like mattresses illustration fig 38 the writer has seen a couch of this kind in a common parlor which cost less than eight dollars was much admired and was a constant comfort to the feeble mother as well as many other members of the family another convenience for a room where sewing is done in summer is a fancyjar set in one corner to receive clippings and any other rubbish it can be covered with prints or paintings and varnished and then looks very prettily the trunks in a chamber can be improved in looks and comfort by making cushions of the same size and shape stuffed with hay and covered with chintz with a frill reaching nearly to the floor every bedchamber should have a washstand bowl pitcher and tumbler with a washbucket under the stand to receive slops a light screen made like a clothesframe and covered with paper or chintz should be furnished for bedrooms occupied by two persons so that ablutions can be performed in privacy it can be ornamented so as to look well anywhere a little frame or towelhorse by the washstand on which to dry towels is a convenience a washstand should be furnished with a sponge or washcloth and a small towel for wiping the basin after using it this should be hung on the washstand or towelhorse for constant use a soapdish and a dish for toothbrushes are neat and convenient and each person should be furnished with two towels one for the feet and one for other purposes it is in good taste to have the curtains bedquilt valance and windowcurtains of similar materials in making featherbeds sidepieces should be put in like those of mattresses and the bed should be well filled so that a person will not be buried in a hollow which is not healthful save in extremely cold weather featherbeds should never be used except in cold weather at other times a thin mattress of hair cotton and moss or straw should be put over them a simple strip of broad straw matting spread over a featherbed answers the same purpose nothing is more debilitating than in warm weather to sleep with a featherbed pressing round the greater part of the body pillows stuffed with papers an inch square are good for summer especially for young children whose heads should be kept cool the cheapest and best covering of a bed for winter is a cotton comforter made to contain three or four pounds of cotton laid in batts or sheets between covers tacked together at regular intervals they should be three yards square and less cotton should be put at the sides that are tucked in it is better to have two thin comforters to each bed than one thick one as then the covering can be regulated according to the weather few domestics will make a bed properly without much attention from the mistress of the family the following directions should be given to those who do this work open the windows and lay off the bedcovering on two chairs at the foot of the bed after the bed is well aired shake the feathers from each corner to the middle then take up the middle and shake it well and turn the bed over then push the feathers in place making the head higher than the foot and the sides even and as high as the middle part then put on the bolster and the under sheet so that the wrong side of the sheet shall go next the bed and the marking come at the head tucking in all around then put on the pillows even so that the open ends shall come to the sides of the bed and then spread on the upper sheet so that the wrong side shall be next the blankets and the marked end at the head this arrangement of sheets is to prevent the part where the feet lie from being reversed so as to come to the face and also to prevent the parts soiled by the body from coming to the bedtick and blankets then put on the other covering except the outer one tucking in all around and then turn over the upper sheet at the head so as to show a part of the pillows when the pillowcases are clean and smooth they look best outside of the cover but not otherwise then draw the hand along the side of the pillows to make an even indentation and then smooth and shape the whole outside a nice housekeeper always notices the manner in which a bed is made and in some parts of the country it is rare to see this work properly performed the writer would here urge every mistress of a family who keeps more than one domestic to provide them with single beds that they may not be obliged to sleep with all the changing domestics who come and go so often where the room is too small for two beds a narrow trucklebed under another will answer domestics should be furnished with washing conveniences in their chambers and be encouraged to keep their persons and rooms neat and in order on packing and storing articles fold a gentlemans coat thuslay it on a table or bed the inside downward and unroll the collar double each sleeve once making the crease at the elbow and laying them so as to make the fewest wrinkles and parallel with the skirts turn the fronts over the back and sleeves and then turn up the skirts making all as smooth as possible fold a shirt thusone that has a bosompiece inserted lay on a bed bosom downward fold each sleeve twice and lay it parallel with the sides of the shirt turn the two sides with the sleeves over the middle part and then turn up the bottom with two folds this makes the collar and bosom lie unpressed on the outside fold a frock thuslay its front downward so as to make the first creases in folding come in the side breadths to do this find the middle of the side breadths by first putting the middle of the front and back breadths together next fold over the side creases so as just to meet the slit behind then fold the skirt again so as to make the backs lie together within and the fronts without then arrange the waist and sleeves and fold the skirt around them in packing trunks for travelling put all heavy articles at the bottom covered with paper which should not be printed as the ink rubs off put coats and pantaloons into linen cases made for the purpose and furnished with strings fill all crevices with small articles as if a trunk is not full nor tightly packed its contents will be shaken about and get injured a thin box the exact size of the trunk with a lid and covered with brown linen is a great convenience to set inside on the top of the trunk to contain light articles which would be injured by tight packing have straps with buckles fastened to the inside near the bottom long enough to come up and buckle over this box by this means when a trunk is not quite full this box can be strapped over so tight as to keep the articles from rubbing underclothing packs closer by being rolled tightly instead of being folded bonnetboxes made of light wood with a lock and key are better than the paper bandboxes so annoying to travellers carpet bags are very useful to carry the articles to be used on a journey the best ones have sides inserted iron rims and a lock and key a large silk travellingbag with a double linen lining in which are stitched receptacles for toothbrush combs and other small articles is a very convenient article for use when travelling a bonnetcover made of some thin material like a large hood with a cape is useful to draw over the bonnet and neck to keep off dust sun and sparks from a steam engine green veils are very apt to stain bonnets when damp in packing household furniture for moving have each box numbered and then have a book in which as each box is packed note down the number of the box and the order in which its contents are packed as this will save much labor and perplexity when unpacking in packing china and glass wrap each article separately in paper and put soft hay or straw at bottom and all around each put the heaviest articles at the bottom and on the top of the box write this side up chapter xxxii on the care of the kitchen cellar and storeroom if parents wish their daughters to grow up with good domestic habits they should have as one means of securing this result a neat and cheerful kitchen a kitchen should always if possible be entirely above ground and well lighted it should have a large sink with a drain running under ground so that all the premises may be kept sweet and clean if flowers and shrubs be cultivated around the doors and windows and the yard near them be kept well turfed it will add very much to their agreeable appearance the walls should often be cleaned and whitewashed to promote a neat look and pure air the floor of a kitchen should be painted or which is better covered with an oilcloth to procure a kitchen oilcloth as cheaply as possible buy cheap tow cloth and fit it to the size and shape of the kitchen then have it stretched and nailed to the south side of the barn and with a brush cover it with a coat of thin rye paste when this is dry put on a coat of yellow paint and let it dry for a fortnight it is safest to first try the paint and see if it dries well as some paint never will dry then put on a second coat and at the end of another fortnight a third coat then let it hang two months and it will last uninjured for many years the longer the paint is left to dry the better if varnished it will last much longer a sink should be scalded out every day and occasionally with hot ley on nails over the sink should be hung three good dishcloths hemmed and furnished with loops one for dishes not greasy one for greasy dishes and one for washing pots and kettles these should be put in the wash every week the lady who insists upon this will not be annoyed by having her dishes washed with dark musty and greasy rags as is too frequently the case under the sink should be kept a sloppail and on a shelf by it a soapdish and two waterpails a large boiler of warm soft water should always be kept over the fire well covered and a hearthbroom and bellows be hung near the fire a clock is a very important article in the kitchen in order to secure regularity at meals on washing dishes no item of domestic labor is so frequently done in a negligent manner by domestics as this a full supply of conveniences will do much toward a remedy of this evil a swab made of strips of linen tied to a stick is useful to wash nice dishes especially small deep articles two or three towels and three dishcloths should be used two large tin tubs painted on the outside should be provided one for washing and one for rinsing also a large old waiter on which to drain the dishes a soapdish with hard soap and a fork with which to use it a sloppail and two pails for water should also be furnished then if there be danger of neglect the following rules for washing dishes legibly written may be hung up by the sink and it will aid in promoting the desired care and neatness rules for washing dishes 1 scrape the dishes putting away any food which may remain on them and which it may be proper to save for future use put grease into the greasepot and whatever else may be on the plates into the sloppail save tealeaves for sweeping set all the dishes when scraped in regular piles the smallest at the top 2 put the nicest articles in the washdish and wash them in hot suds with the swab or nicest dishcloth wipe all metal articles as soon as they are washed put all the rest into the rinsingdish which should be filled with hot water when they are taken out lay them to drain on the waiter then rinse the dishcloth and hang it up wipe the articles washed and put them in their places 3 pour in more hot water wash the greasy dishes with the dishcloth made for them rinse them and set them to drain wipe them and set them away wash the knives and forks being careful that the handles are never put in water wipe them and then lay them in a knifedish to be scoured 4 take a fresh supply of clean suds in which wash the milkpans buckets and tins then rinse and hang up this dishcloth and take the other with which wash the roaster gridiron pots and kettles then wash and rinse the dishcloth and hang it up empty the slopbucket and scald it dry metal teapots and tins before the fire then put the fireplace in order and sweep and dust the kitchen some persons keep a deep and narrow vessel in which to wash knives with a swab so that a careless domestic cannot lay them in the water while washing them this article can be carried into the eatingroom to receive the knives and forks when they are taken from the table kitchen furniture crockery brown earthen pans are said to be best for milk and for cooking tin pans are lighter and more convenient but are too cold for many purposes tall earthen jars with covers are good to hold butter salt lard c acids should never be put into the red earthen ware as there is a poisonous ingredient in the glazing which the acid takes off stone ware is better and stronger and safer every way than any other kind iron ware many kitchens are very imperfectly supplied with the requisite conveniences for cooking when a person has sufficient means the following articles are all desirable a nest of iron pots of different sizes they should be

catch the grease a dutch oven called also a bakepan two skillets of different sizes and a spider or flat skillet for frying a griddle a waffleiron tin and iron bake and breadpans two ladles of

towels for dishes marked t six large rollertowels a dozen handtowels marked h t and a dozen hemmed dishcloths with loops also two thick linen pudding or dumplingcloths a gellybag made of white flannel to strain gelly a starchstrainer and a bag for boiling clothes in a closet should be kept arranged in order the following articles the dustpan dustbrush and dustingcloths old flannel and cotton for scouring and rubbing sponges for washing windows and lookingglasses a long brush for cobwebs and another for washing the outside of windows whiskbrooms common brooms a coatbroom or brush a whitewashbrush a stovebrush shoebrushes and blacking articles for cleaning tin and silver leather for cleaning metals bottles containing stainmixtures and other articles used in cleansing on the care of the cellar a cellar should often be whitewashed to keep it sweet it should have a drain to keep it perfectly dry as standing water in a cellar is a sure cause of disease in a family it is very dangerous to leave decayed vegetables in a cellar many a fever has been caused by the poisonous miasm thus generated the following articles are desirable in a cellar a safe or moveable closet with sides of wire or perforated tin in which cold meats cream and other articles should be kept if ants be troublesome set the legs in tin cups of water a refrigerator or large wooden box on feet with a lining of tin or zinc and a space between the tin and wood filled with powdered charcoal having at the bottom a place for ice a drain to carry off the water and also moveable shelves and partitions in this articles are kept cool it should be cleaned once a week filtering jars to purify water should also be kept in the cellar fish and cabbages in a cellar are apt to scent a house and give a bad taste to other articles storeroom every house needs a storeroom in which to keep tea coffee sugar rice candles c it should be furnished with jars having labels a large spoon a fork sugar and flourscoops a towel and a dishcloth modes of destroying insects and vermin bedbugs should be kept away by filling every chink in the bedstead with putty and if it be old painting it over of all the mixtures for killing them corrosive sublimate and alcohol is the surest this is a strong poison cockroaches may be destroyed by pouring boiling water into their haunts or setting a mixture of arsenic mixed with indian meal and molasses where they are found chloride of lime and sweetened water will also poison them fleas if a dog be infested with these insects put him in a tub of warm soapsuds and they will rise to the surface take them off and burn them strong perfumes about the person diminish their attacks when caught between the fingers plunge them in water or they will escape crickets scalding and sprinkling scotch snuff about the haunts of these insects are remedies for the annoyance caused by them flies can be killed in great quantities by placing about the house vessels filled with sweetened water and cobalt six cents worth of cobalt is enough for a pint of water it is very poisonous musquitoes close nets around a bed are the only sure protection at night against these insects spirit of hartshorn is the best antidote for their bite salt and water is good red or black ants may be driven away by scalding their haunts and putting scotch snuff wherever they go for food set the legs of closets and safes in pans of water and they cannot get at them moths airing clothes does not destroy moths but laying them in a hot sun does if articles be tightly sewed up in linen and fine tobacco be put about them it is a sure protection this should be done in april rats and mice a good cat is the best remedy for these annoyances equal quantities of hemlock or cicuta and old cheese will poison them but this renders the house liable to the inconvenience of a bad smell this evil however may be lessened by placing a dish containing oil of vitriol poured on saltpetre where the smell is most annoying chloride of lime and water is also good chapter xxxiii on sewing cutting and mending every young girl should be taught to do the following kinds of stitch with propriety overstitch hemming running felling stitching backstitch and run buttonholestitch chainstitch whipping darning gathering and crossstitch in doing overstitch the edges should always be first fitted either with pins or basting to prevent puckering in turning wide hems a paper measure should be used to make them even tucks also should be regulated by a paper measure a fell should be turned before the edges are put together and the seam should be oversewed before felling all biased or goring seams should be felled for stitching draw a thread and take up two or three threads at a stitch in making buttonholes it is best to have a pair of scissors made for the purpose which cut very neatly for broadcloth a chisel and board are better the best stitch is made by putting in the needle and then turning the thread around it near the eye this is better than to draw the needle through and then take up a loop a thread should first be put across each side of the buttonhole and also a staythread or bar at each end before working it in working the buttonhole keep the staythread as far from the edge as possible a small bar should be worked at each end whipping is done better by sewing over and not under the roll should be as fine as possible the stitches short the thread strong and in sewing every gather should be taken up the rule for gathering in shirts is to draw a thread and then take up two threads and skip four in darning after the perpendicular threads are run the crossing threads should interlace exactly taking one thread and leaving one like woven threads the neatest sewers always fit and baste their work before sewing and they say they always save time in the end by so doing as they never have to pick out work on account of mistakes it is wise to sew closely and tightly all new garments which will never be altered in shape but some are more nice than wise in sewing frocks and old garments in the same style however this is the least common extreme it is much more frequently the case that articles which ought to be strongly and neatly made are sewed so that a nice sewer would rather pick out the threads and sew over again than to be annoyed with the sight of grinning stitches and vexed with constant rips workbaskets it is very important to neatness comfort and success in sewing that a ladys workbasket should be properly fitted up the following articles are needful to the mistress of a family a large basket to hold work having in it fastened a smaller basket or box containing a needlebook in which are needles of every size both blunts and sharps with a larger number of those sizes most used also small and large darningneedles for woollen cotton and silk two tapeneedles large and small nice scissors for fine work buttonhole scissors an emerybag two balls of white and yellow wax and two thimbles in case one should be mislaid when a person is troubled with damp fingers a lump of soft chalk in a paper is useful to rub on the ends of the fingers besides this box keep in the basket common scissors small shears a bag containing tapes of all colors and sizes done up in rolls bags one containing spools of white and another of colored cotton thread and another for silks wound on spools or papers a box or bag for nice buttons and another for more common ones a bag containing silk braid welting cords and galloon binding small rolls of pieces of white and brown linen and cotton are also often needed a brick pincushion is a great convenience in sewing and better than screwcushions it is made by covering half a brick with cloth putting a cushion on the top and covering it tastefully it is very useful to hold pins and needles while sewing and to fasten long seams when basting and sewing to make a frock the best way for a novice is to get a dress fitted not sewed at the best mantuamakers then take out a sleeve rip it to pieces and cut out a pattern then take out half of the waist it must have a seam in front and cut out a pattern of the back and forebody both lining and outer part in cutting the patterns iron the pieces smooth let the paper be stiff and with a pin prick holes in the paper to show the gore in front and the depth of the seams with a pen and ink draw lines from each pinhole to preserve this mark then baste the parts together again in doing which the unbasted half will serve as a pattern when this is done a lady of common ingenuity can cut and fit a dress by these patterns if the waist of a dress be too tight the seam under the arm must be let out and in cutting a dress an allowance should be made for letting it out if needful at this seam the lining of the forebody must be biased the linings for the waists of dresses should be stiffened cotton or linen in cutting biaspieces for trimming they will not set well unless they are exact in cutting them use a long rule and a lead pencil or piece of chalk weltingcords should be covered with biaspieces and it saves time in many cases to baste on the weltingcord at the same time that you cover it the best way to put on hooks and eyes is to sew them on double broad tape and then sew this on the frocklining they can then be moved easily and do not show where they are sewed on in cutting a sleeve double it biased the skirts of dresses look badly if not full and in putting on lining at the bottom be careful to have it a very little fuller than the dress or it will shrink and look badly all thin silks look much better with lining and last much longer as do aprons also in putting a lining to a dress baste it on each separate breadth and sew it in at the seams and it looks much better than to have it fastened only at the bottom make notches in selvedge to prevent it from drawing up the breadth dresses which are to be washed should not be lined figured silks do not generally wear well if the figure be large and satinlike black and plaincolored silks can be tested by procuring samples and making creases in them fold the creases in a bunch and rub them against a rough surface of moreen or carpeting those which are poor will soon wear off at the creases plaids look becoming for tall women as they shorten the appearance of the figure stripes look becoming on a large person as they reduce the apparent size pale persons should not wear blue or green and brunettes should not wear light delicate colors except shades of buff fawn or straw color pearl white is not good for any complexion dead white and black look becoming on almost all persons it is best to try colors by candlelight for evening dresses as some colors which look very handsome in the daylight are very homely when seen by candlelight never cut a dress low in the neck as this shows that a woman is not properly instructed in the rules of modesty and decorum or that she has not sense enough to regard them never be in haste to be first in a fashion and never go to the extremes in buying linen seek for that which has a round close thread and is perfectly white for if it be not white at first it will never afterwards become so much that is called linen at the shops is half cotton and does not wear so well as cotton alone cheap linens are usually of this kind it is difficult to discover which are all linen but the best way is to find a lot presumed to be good take a sample wash it and ravel it if this be good the rest of the same lot will probably be so if you cannot do this draw a thread each way and if both appear equally strong it is probably all linen linen and cotton must be put in clean water and boiled to get out the starch and then ironed a long piece of linen a yard wide will with care and calculation make eight shirts in cutting it take a shirt of the right size as a guide in fitting and basting bosompieces false collars c must be cut and fitted by a pattern which suits the person for whom the articles are designed gentlemens nightshirts are made like other shirts except that they are longer in cutting chemises if the cotton or linen is a yard wide cut off small half gores at the top of the breadths and set them on the bottom use a long rule and a pencil in cutting gores in cutting cotton which is quite wide a seam can be saved by cutting out two at once in this mannercut off three breadths and with a long rule and a pencil mark and cut off the gores thus from one breadth cut off two gores the whole length each gore one fourth of the breadth at the bottom and tapering off to a point at the top the other two breadths are to have a gore cut off from each which is one fourth wide at top and two fourths at bottom arrange these pieces right and they will make two chemises one having four seams and the other three this is a much easier way of cutting than sewing the three breadths together in bagfashion as is often done the biased or goring seams must always be felled the sleeves and neck can be cut according to the taste of the wearer by another chemise for a pattern there should be a lining around the armholes and stays at all corners six yards of yard width will make two chemises old silk dresses quilted for skirts are very serviceable white flannel is soiled so easily and shrinks so much in washing that it is a good plan to color it a light dovecolor according to the receipt given on page 301 cotton flannel dyed thus is also good for common skirts in making up flannel backstitch and run the seams and then crossstitch them open nice flannel for infants can be ornamented with very little expense of time by turning up the hem on the right side and making a little vine at the edge with saddlers silk the stitch of the vine is a modification of buttonholestitch long night gowns are best cut a little goring it requires five yards for a long nightgown and two and a half for a short one linen nightcaps wear longer than cotton ones and do not like them turn yellow they should be ruffled with linen as cotton borders will not last so long as the cap a doublequilted wrapper is a great comfort in case of sickness it may be made of two old dresses it should not be cut full but rather like a gentlemans studygown having no gathers or plaits but large enough to slip off and on with ease a double gown of calico is also very useful most articles of dress for grown persons or children require patterns bedding the best beds are thick hair mattresses which for persons in health are good for winter as well as summer use mattresses may also be made of husks dried and drawn into shreds also of alternate layers of cotton and moss the most profitable sheeting is the russian which will last three times as long as any other it is never perfectly white unbleached cotton is good for winter it is poor economy to make narrow and short sheets as children and domestics will always slip them off and soil the bedtick and bolster they should be three yards long and two and a half wide so that they can be tucked in all around all bedlinen should be marked and numbered so that a bed can always be made properly and all missing articles be known mending silk dresses will last much longer by ripping out the sleeves when thin and changing the arms and also the breadths of the skirt tumbled black silk which is old and rusty should be dipped in water then be drained for a few minutes without squeezing or pressing and then ironed cold tea is better than water sheets when worn thin in the middle should be ripped and the other edges sewed together windowcurtains last much longer if lined as the sun fades and rots them broadcloth should be cut with reference to the way the nap runs when pantaloons are thin it is best to newly seat them cutting the piece inserted in a curve as corners are difficult to fit when the knees are thin it is a case of domestic surgery which demands amputation this is performed by cutting off both legs some distance above the knees and then changing the legs take care to cut them off exactly of the same length or in the exchange they will not fit this method brings the worn spot under the knees and the seam looks much better than a patch and darn hose can be cut down when the feet are worn take an old stocking and cut it up for a pattern make the heel short in sewing turn each edge and run it down and then sew over the edges this is better than to stitch and then crossstitch run thin places in stockings and it will save darning a hole if shoes are worn through on the sides in the upperleather slip pieces of broadcloth under and sew them around the holes if in sewing the thread kinks break it off and begin at the other end in using spoolcotton thread the needle with the end which comes off first and not the end where you break it off this often prevents kinks chapter xxxiv on the care of yards and gardens the authorities consulted in the preparation of this and kindred chapters are loudons encyclopdia of gardening bridgemans young gardener hoveys magazine of horticulture the writings of judge buelt and downings landscape gardening on the preparation of soil if the garden soil be clayey and adhesive put on a covering of sand three inches thick and the same depth of wellrotted manure spade it in as deep as possible and mix it well if the soil be sandy and loose spade in clay and ashes ashes are good for all kinds of soil as they loosen those which are close hold moisture in those which are sandy and destroy insects the best kind of soil is that which will hold water the longest without becoming hard when dry to prepare soil for potplants take one fourth part of common soil one fourth part of welldecayed manure and one half of vegetable mould from the woods or from a chipyard break up the manure fine and sift it through a limescreen or coarse wire sieve these materials must be thoroughly mixed when the common soil which is used is adhesive and indeed in most other cases it is necessary to add sand the proportion of which must depend on the nature of the soil on the preparation of a hot bed dig a pit six feet long five feet wide and thirty inches deep make a frame of the same size with the back two feet high the front fifteen inches and the sides sloped from the back to the front make two sashes each three feet by five with the panes of glass lapping like shingles instead of having cross bars set the frame over the pit which should then be filled with fresh horsedung which has not lain long nor been sodden by water tread it down hard then put into the frame light and very rich soil ten or twelve inches deep and cover it with the sashes for two or three days then stir the soil and sow the seeds in shallow drills placing sticks by them to mark the different kinds keep the frame covered with the glass whenever it is cold enough to chill the plants but at all other times admit fresh air which is indispensable to their health when the sun is quite warm raise the glasses enough to admit air and cover them with matting or blankets or else the sun may kill the young plants water the bed at evening with water which has stood all day or if it be fresh drawn add a little warm water if there be too much heat in the bed so as to scorch or wither the plants make deep holes with stakes and fill them up when the heat is reduced in very cold nights cover the box with straw on planting flower seeds break up the soil till it is very soft and free from lumps rub that nearest the surface between the hands to make it fine make a circular drill a foot in diameter for seeds as large as sweet peas it should be half an inch deep the smallest seeds must be planted very near the surface and a very little fine earth be sifted over them seeds are to be planted either deeper or nearer the surface according to their size after covering them with soil beat them down with a trowel so as to make the earth as compact as it is after a heavy shower set up a stick in the middle of the circle with the name of the plant heavily written upon it with a dark lead pencil this remains more permanent if white lead be first rubbed over the surface never plant when the soil is very wet in very dry times water the seeds at night never use very cold water when the seeds are small many should be planted together that they may assist each other in breaking the soil when the plants are an inch high thin them out leaving only one or two if the plant be a large one like the balsam five or six when it is of a medium size and eighteen or twenty of the smaller size transplanting retards the growth of a plant about a fortnight it is best to plant at two different times lest the first planting should fail owing to wet or cold weather to plant garden seeds make the beds a yard wide lay across them a board a yard long and a foot wide and with a stick make a furrow on each side of it one inch deep scatter the seeds in this furrow and cover them then lay the board over them and step on it to press down the earth when the plants are an inch high thin them out leaving spaces proportioned to their sizes seeds of a similar species such as melons and squashes should not be planted very near to each other as this causes them to degenerate the same kinds of vegetables should not be planted in the same place for two years in succession on transplanting transplant at evening or which is better just before a shower take a round stick sharpened at the point and make openings to receive the plants set them a very little deeper than they were before and press the soil firmly round them then water them and cover them for three or four days taking care that sufficient air be admitted if the plant can be removed without disturbing the soil around the root it will not be at all retarded by transplanting never remove leaves and branches unless a part of the roots be lost to repot houseplants renew the soil every year soon after the time of blossoming prepare soil as previously directed loosen the earth from the pot by passing a knife around the sides turn the plant upside down and remove the pot then remove all the matted fibres at the bottom and all the earth except that which adheres to the roots from woody plants like roses shake off all the earth take the new pot and put a piece of broken earthenware over the hole at the bottom and then holding the plant in the proper position shake in the earth around it then pour in water to settle the earth and heap on fresh soil till the pot is even full small pots are considered better than large ones as the roots are not so likely to rot from excess of moisture on the laying out of yards and gardens in planting trees in a yard they should be arranged in groups and never planted in straight lines nor sprinkled about as solitary trees the object of this arrangement is to imitate nature and secure some spots of dense shade and some of cleared turf in yards which are covered with turf beds can be cut out of it and raised for flowers a trench should be made around to prevent the grass from running on them these beds can be made in the shape of crescents ovals or other fanciful forms of which the figure below is one specimen illustration fig 39 in laying out beds in gardens and yards a very pretty bordering can be made by planting them with common flax seed in a line about three inches from the edge this can be trimmed with shears when it grows too high on the cultivation of bulbs and tuberous roots for planting the amaryllis take one third part of leaf mould half as much sand and the remainder earth from under fresh grass sods plant them in may the bulb should not be set more than half its depth in the ground the anemone and ranunculus are medium or halfhardy roots they should be planted in soil which is enriched with cowdung and the beds should be raised only an inch from the walk they must be planted in october in drills two inches deep the claws of the roots downward and be shaded when they begin to bud the crocus must be planted in october two inches deep and four inches apart in measuring the depth always calculate from the top of the bulb crown imperial this must be planted in september three or four inches deep and need not be taken up but once in three years gladiolus those who have greenhouses or pits plant the gladiolus in october and preserve it in pots through the winter those who have not these conveniences may plant these bulbs late in april the earth must be composed of one half common soil one fourth leaf mould and one fourth sand plant them about an inch deep hyacinths should be planted in october eight inches apart and three or four inches deep in a rich soil jonquilles should be planted in october two inches deep in a rich soil and should not be taken up oftener than once in three years narcissus this should be planted in october four inches deep covered through the winter with straw and leaves six inches thick and uncovered in the middle of march oxalis plant this in september in a soil composed of two thirds common earth and one third leaf mould the old bulb dies after blossoming and is succeeded by a new one plant tulips in rich soil in october three inches deep plant tuberoses late in april in a rich sandy soil they are delicate plants and should be covered in case of frosts daffodils should be planted two inches deep when bulbs have done flowering and their leaves begin to decay they should be taken up and dried and kept in a dry place till october when they are to be replanted taking off the offsets and putting them in a bed by themselves bulbs which blossom in water or are in any other way forced to bloom out of season are so much exhausted by it that it takes them two or three years to recover their beauty dahlias dig a hole a foot and a half deep fill it with very light loose and rich soil and drive in a stake a yard and a half high to which to tie the future plants then set in the root so that it shall be an inch below the soil where the sprout starts when the plants are two feet high tie them to the stakes and take off some of the lower sideshoots continue to tie them as their growth advances if the roots are planted in the open borders without any previous growth it should be done as early as the first of may and they should be covered from the frosts when they are brought forward in pots or hotbeds they should be put out in the middle of june it is said by gardeners that late planting is better than early for producing perfect flowers in the autumn after the frosts have destroyed the tops let the roots remain awhile in the ground to ripen then dig them up and pack them away in some place where they will neither mould from dampness nor freeze in the spring these roots will throw out sprouts and must then be divided so as to leave a good shoot attached to a piece of the tuber or old stem and each shoot will make a new plant it is stated that if the shoots themselves without any root be planted in light soil covered with a bellglass or large tumbler and carefully watered they will produce plants superior to those with roots annuals these are flowers which last only one season they should be so planted that the tallest may be in the middle of a bed and the shortest at the edges and flowers of a similar color should not be planted adjacent to each other the following is a list of some of the handsomest annuals arranged with reference to their color and height those with a star before them do best when sowed in the autumn those with tr after them are trailing plants six inches to one foot high white ice plant sweet alyssum white leptosiphon

cabbage roses moss roses when budded on other rose bushes last only three years shade trees the following are among the finest mountain ash ailanthus or tree of heaven grows very fast tulip tree linden elm locust maple dog wood horse chestnut catalpa hemlock silver fir and cedar these should be grouped in such a manner that trees of different shades of green and of different heights should stand in the same group the autumn is the best time for transplanting trees take as much of the root as possible especially the little fibres which should never become dry if kept long before they are set out put wet moss around them and water them dig holes larger than the extent of the roots let one person hold the tree in its former position and another place the roots carefully as they were before cutting off any broken or wounded root be careful not to let the tree be more than an inch deeper than it was before let the soil be soft and well manured shake the tree as the soil is shaken in that it may mix well among the small fibres do not tread the earth down while filling the hole but when it is full raise a slight mound of say four inches and then tread it down make a little basin two inches deep around the stem to hold water and fill it never cut off leaves nor branches unless some of the roots are lost tie the trees to a stake and they will be more likely to live water them often on the care of houseplants the soil of houseplants should be renewed every year as previously directed in winter they should be kept as dry as they can be without wilting many houseplants are injured by giving them too much water when they have little light and fresh air this makes them grow spindling the more fresh air warmth and light they have the more water is needed they ought not to be kept very warm in winter nor exposed to great changes of atmosphere forty degrees is a proper temperature for plants in winter when they have little sun and air when plants have become spindling cut off their heads entirely and cover the pot in the earth where it has the morning sun only a new and flourishing head will spring out few houseplants can bear the sun at noon when insects infest plants set them in a closet or under a barrel and burn tobacco the smoke kills any insect enveloped in it when plants are frozen cold water and a gradual restoration of warmth are the best remedies never use very cold water for plants at any season footnote t his farmers companion was written expressly for the larger series of the school library issued by the publishers of this volume chapter xxxv on the propagation of plants bulbous roots are propagated by offsets some growing on the top others around the sides many plants are propagated by cutting off twigs and setting them in earth so that two or three eyes are covered to do this select a side shoot ten inches long two inches of it being of the preceding years growth and the rest the growth of the season when it is set out do this when the sap is running and put a piece of crockery at the bottom of the shoot when it is buried one eye at least must be under the soil water it and shade it in hot weather plants are also propagated by layers to do this take a shoot which comes up near the root bend it down so as to bring several eyes under the soil leaving the top above ground if the shoot be cut half through in a slanting direction at one of these eyes before burying it the result is more certain roses honeysuckles and many other shrubs are readily propagated thus they will generally take root by being simply buried but cutting them as here directed is the best method layers are more certain than cuttings for all woody plants budding and grafting are favorite methods of propagation in all such plants there is an outer and inner bark the latter containing the sap vessels in which the nourishment of the tree ascends the success of grafting or inoculating consists in so placing the bud or graft that the sap vessels of the inner bark shall exactly join those of the plant into which they are grafted so that the sap may pass from one into the other the following are directions for budding which may be performed at any time from july to september select a smooth place on the stock into which you are to insert the bud make a horizontal cut across the rind through to the firm wood and from the middle of this make a slit downward perpendicularly an inch or more long through to the wood raise the bark of the stock on each side of the perpendicular cut for the admission of the bud as is shown in the annexed engraving fig 40 then take a shoot of this years growth and slice from it a bud taking an inch below and an inch above it and some portion of the wood under it then carefully slip off the woody part under the bud examine whether the eye or gem of the bud be perfect if a little hole appears in that part the bud has lost its root and another must be selected insert the bud so that a of the bud shall pass to a of the stock then b of the bud must be cut off to match the cut b in the stock and fitted exactly to it as it is this alone which insures success bind the parts with fresh bass or woollen yarn beginning a little below the bottom of the perpendicular slit and winding it closely round every part except just over the eye of the bud until you arrive above the horizontal cut do not bind it too tightly but just sufficient to exclude air sun and wet this is to be removed after the bud is firmly fixed and begins to grow illustration fig 40 seedfruit can be budded into any other seedfruit and stonefruit into any other stonefruit but stone and seedfruits cannot be thus mingled rose bushes can have a variety of kinds budded into the same stock hardy roots are the best stocks the branch above the bud must be cut off the next march or april after the bud is put in apples and pears are more easily propagated by ingrafting than by budding ingrafting is a similar process to budding with this advantage that it can be performed on large trees whereas budding can be applied only on small ones the two common kinds of ingrafting are whipgrafting and splitgrafting the first kind is for young trees and the other for large ones illustration fig 41 the time for ingrafting is from may to october the cuttings must be taken from horizontal shoots between christmas and march and kept in a damp cellar in performing the operation cut off in a sloping direction as seen in fig 41 the tree or limb to be grafted then cut off in a corresponding slant the slip to be grafted on then put them together so that the inner bark of each shall match exactly on one side and tie them firmly together with woollen yarn it is not essential that both be of equal size if the bark of each meet together exactly on one side it answers the purpose but the two must not differ much in size the slope should be an inch and a half or more in length after they are tied together the place should be covered with a salve or composition of beeswax and rosin a mixture of clay and cowdung will answer the same purpose this last must be tied on with a cloth grafting is more convenient than budding as grafts can be sent from a great distance whereas buds must be taken in july or august from a shoot of the present years growth and cannot be sent to any great distance illustration fig 42 this engraving fig 42 exhibits the mode called stockgrafting a being the limb of a large tree which is sawed off and split and is to be held open by a small wedge till the grafts are put in a graft inserted in the limb is shown at b and at c is one not inserted but designed to be put in at d as two grafts can be put into a large stock in inserting the graft be careful to make the edge of the inner bark of the graft meet exactly the edge of the inner bark of the stock for on this success depends after the grafts are put in the wedge must be withdrawn and the whole of the stock be covered with the thick salve or composition before mentioned reaching from where the grafts are inserted to the bottom of the slit be careful not to knock or move the grafts after they are put in pruning the following rules for pruning are from a distinguished horticulturist prune off all dead wood and all the little twigs on the main limbs retrench branches so as to give light and ventilation to the interior of the tree select the straight and perpendicular shoots which give little or no fruit while those which are most nearly horizontal and somewhat curving give fruit abundantly and of good quality superfluous and illplaced buds may be rubbed off at any time and no buds pushing out after midsummer should be spared in choosing between shoots to be retained preserve the lowest placed and on lateral shoots those which are nearest the origin when branches cross each other so as to rub remove one or the other remove all suckers from the roots of trees or shrubs prune after the sap is in full circulation except in the case of grapes as the wounds then heal best some think it best to prune before the sap begins to run pruningshears and a pruningpole with a chisel at the end can be procured of those who deal in agricultural utensils thinning as it is the office of the leaves to absorb nourishment from the atmosphere they should never be removed except to mature the wood or fruit in doing this remove such leaves as shade the fruit as soon as it is ready to ripen to do it earlier impairs the growth do it gradually at two different times thinning the fruit is important as tending to increase its size and flavor and also to promote the longevity of the tree if the fruit be thickly set take off one half at the time of setting revise in june and then in july taking off all that may be spared one very large apple to every square foot is a rule that may be a sort of guide in other cases according to this two hundred large apples would be allowed to a tree whose extent is fifteen feet by twelve if any person think this thinning excessive let him try two similar trees and thin one as directed and leave the other unthinned it will be found that the thinned tree will produce an equal weight and fruit of much finer flavor chapter xxxvi on the cultivation of fruit by a little attention to this matter a lady with the help of her children can obtain a rich abundance of all kinds of fruit the writer has resided in families where little boys of eight ten and twelve years old amused themselves under the direction of their mother in planting walnuts chestnuts and hazelnuts for future time as well as in planting and inoculating young fruittrees of all descriptions a mother who will take pains to inspire a love for such pursuits in her children and who will aid and superintend them will save them from many temptations and at a trifling expense secure to them and herself a rich reward in the choicest fruits the information given in this work on this subject may be relied on as sanctioned by the most experienced nurserymen the soil for a nursery should be rich well dug dressed with welldecayed manure free from weeds and protected from cold winds fruit seeds should be planted in the autumn an inch and a half or two inches deep in ridges four or five feet apart pressing the earth firmly over the seeds while growing they should be thinned out leaving the best ones a foot and a half apart the soil should be kept loose soft and free from weeds they should be inoculated or ingrafted when of the size of a pipe stem and in a year after this may be transplanted to their permanent stand peach trees sometimes bear in two years from budding and in four years from planting if well kept in a year after transplanting take pains to train the head aright straight upright branches produce gourmands or twigs bearing only leaves the side branches which are angular or curved yield the most fruit for this reason the limbs should be trained in curves and perpendicular twigs should be cut off if there be need of pruning the last of june is the time for this grass should never be allowed to grow within four feet of a large tree and the soil should be kept loose to admit air to the roots trees in orchards should be twentyfive feet apart the soil under the top soil has much to do with the health of trees if it be what is called hardpan the trees will deteriorate trees need to be manured and to have the soil kept open and free from weeds filberts can be raised in any part of this country figs can be raised in the middle states for this purpose in the autumn loosen the roots on one side and bend the tree down to the earth on the other then cover it with a mound of straw earth and boards and early in the spring raise it up and cover the roots currants grow well in any but a wet soil they are propagated by cuttings the old wood should be thinned in the fall and manure be put on they can be trained into small trees gooseberries are propagated by layers and cuttings they are best when kept from suckers and trained like trees one third of the old wood should be removed every autumn raspberries do best when shaded during a part of the day they are propagated by layers slips and suckers there is one kind which bears monthly strawberries require a light soil and vegetable manure they should be transplanted in april or september and be set eight inches apart in rows nine inches asunder and in beds which are two feet wide with narrow alleys between them a part of these plants are nonbearers these have large flowers with showy stamens and high black anthers the bearers have short stamens a great number of pistils and the flowers are every way less showy in blossomtime pull out all the nonbearers some think it best to leave one nonbearer to every twelve bearers but others pull them all out many beds never produce any fruit because all the plants in them are nonbearers weeds should be kept from the vines when the vines are matted with young plants the best way is to dig over the beds in cross lines so as to leave some of the plants standing in little squares while the rest are turned under the soil this should be done over a second time in the same year grapes to raise this fruit manure the soil and keep it soft and free from weeds a gravelly or sandy soil and a south exposure are best transplant the vines in the early spring or better in the fall prune them the first year so as to have only two main branches taking off all other shoots as fast as they come in november cut off all of these two branches except four eyes the second year in the spring loosen the earth around the roots and allow only two branches to grow and every month take off all side shoots when they are very strong preserve only a part and cut off the rest in the fall in november cut off all the two main stems except eight eyes after the second year no more pruning is needed except to reduce the side shoots for the purpose of increasing the fruit all the pruning of grapes except nipping side shoots must be done when the sap is not running or they will bleed to death train them on poles or lattices to expose them to the air and sun cover tender vines in the autumn grapes are propagated by cuttings layers and seeds for cuttings select in the autumn wellripened wood of the former year and take five joints for each bury them till april then soak them for some hours and set them out aslant so that all the eyes but one shall be covered to preserve fruit raspberries and strawberries can be preserved in perfect flavor in the following manner take a pound of nice sifted sugar for each pound of fruit put them in alternate layers of fruit and sugar till the jar is entirely full then cork it and seal it air tight currants and gooseberries may be perfectly preserved thus gather them when dry selecting only the solid ones take off the stalks and put them in dry junkbottles set them uncorked in a kettle of water and slowly raise it to boiling heat in order to drive the air out of the bottles then take out the bottles cork them and seal them air tight keep them in a dry place where they will not freeze the success of this method depends on excluding air and water apples grapes and such like fruit can be preserved by packing them when dry and solid in dry sand or sawdust putting alternate layers of fruit and sawdust or sand some sawdust gives a bad flavor to the fruit modes of preserving fruit trees heaps of ashes or tanners bark around peach trees prevent the attack of the worm the yellows is a disease of peach trees which is spread by the pollen of the blossom when a tree begins to turn yellow take it away with all its roots before it blossoms again or it will infect other trees planting tansy around the roots of fruit trees is a sure protection against worms as it prevents the moth from depositing her egg equal quantities of salt and saltpetre put around the trunk of a peach tree half a pound to a tree improves the size and flavor of the fruit apply this about the first of april and if any trees have worms already in them put on half the quantity in addition in june to young trees just set out apply one ounce in april and another in june close to the stem sandy soil is best for peaches apple trees are preserved from insects by a wash of strong ley to the body and limbs which if old should be first scraped caterpillars should be removed by cutting down their nests in a damp day boring a hole in a tree infested with worms and filling it with sulphur will often drive them off immediately the fireblight or brlure in pear trees can be stopped by cutting off all the blighted branches it is supposed by some to be owing to an excess of sap which is remedied by diminishing the roots the curculio which destroys plums and other stone fruit can be checked only by gathering up all the fruit that falls which contains their eggs and destroying it the cankerworm can be checked by applying a bandage around the body of the tree and every evening smearing it with fresh tar chapter xxxvii miscellaneous directions every woman should know how to direct in regard to the proper care of domestic animals as they often suffer from the negligence of domestics the following information in reference to the care of a horse and cow may be useful a stable should not be very light nor very dark its floor should be either plank or soil as brick or stone pavements injure the feet it should be well cleaned every morning a horse kept in a stable should be rubbed and brushed every day a stablehorse needs as much daily exercise as trotting three miles will give him food or drink should never be given when a horse is very warm with exercise as it causes disease a horse should be fed three times a day hay sheafoats shorts cornmeal and bran are the best food for horses when a horse is travelling order six quarts of oats in the morning four at noon and six at night and direct that neither food nor water be given till he is cool keep a horses legs free from mud or disease will often result from the neglect a horse much used should be shod as often as once in two months fishoil and strong perfumes on the skin keep flies from annoying a horse some horses are made fractious by having the checkrein so tight as to weary the muscles a cow should be watered three times a day and fed with hay potatoes carrots and boiled corn turnips and cabbages give a bad taste to the milk give a handful of salt to a cow twice a week and occasionally give the same quantity to a horse let them drink pure water a wellfed cow gives double the milk that she will if not fed well a cow should go unmilked for two months before calving and her milk should not be used till four days after the calf must run with the cow for four days and then be shut from her except thrice a day when it should take as much food as it wants and then the cow should be milked clean hens sit twenty days and should be well fed and watered during this time the first food for chickens should be coarse dry meal cold and damp weather is bad for all young fowls and they should be well protected from it pepperberries are good for fowls which have diseases caused by damp and cold weather in winter much fuel may be saved and comfort secured by stuffing cotton into all cracks about the windows and the surbases of rooms and by listing the doors cover strips of wood with baize and nail them tight against a door on the casing the following are the causes of smoky chimneys short and broad flues running up straight as a narrow flue with a bend in it draws best large openings at the top draw the wind down and should be remedied by having the summits made tapering a house higher than a chimney near it sometimes makes the chimney smoke and the evil should be remedied by raising the chimney too large a throat to the fireplace sometimes causes a chimney to smoke and can be remedied by a false back or by lowering the front with sheet iron shallow fireplaces give out more heat and draw as well as deep ones housecleaning should be done in dry warm weather several friends of the writer maintain that cleaning paint and windows and floors in hard cold water without any soap using a flannel washcloth is much better than using warm suds it is worth trying in cleaning in the common way sponges are best for windows and clean water only should be used they should be first wiped with linen and then with old silk the outside of windows should be washed with a long brush made for the purpose and they should be rinsed by throwing upon them water containing a little saltpetre when inviting company mention in the note the day of the month and week and the hour for coming provide a place for ladies to dress their hair with a glass pins and combs a pitcher of cold water and a tumbler should be added when the company is small it is becoming a common method for the table to be set at one end of the room the lady of the house to pour out tea and the gentlemen of the party to wait on the ladies and themselves when tea is sent round always send a teapot of hot water to weaken it and a slopbowl or else many persons will drink their tea much stronger than they wish let it ever be remembered that the burning of lights and the breath of guests are constantly exhausting the air of its healthful principle therefore avoid crowding many guests into one room do not tempt the palate by a great variety of unhealthful dainties have a warm room for departing guests that they may not become chilled before they go out a parlor should be furnished with candle and fire screens for those who have weak eyes and if at table a person sits with the back near the fire a screen should be hung on the back of the chair as it is very injurious to the whole system to have the back heated pretty baskets for flowers or fruits on centre tables can be made thus knit with coarse needles all the

the american housekeepers receipt book prepared by the author of this work under the supervision of several experienced housekeepers is designed as a supplement to this treatise on domestic economy the following preface and analysis of the contents will indicate its design more fully preface for the american housekeepers receipt book the following objects are aimed at in this work first to furnish an original collection of receipts which shall embrace a great variety of simple and wellcooked dishes designed for everyday comfort and enjoyment second to include in the collection only such receipts as have been tested by superior housekeepers and warranted to be the best it is not a book made up in any department by copying from other books but entirely from the experience of the best practical housekeepers third to express every receipt in language which is short simple and perspicuous and yet to give all directions so minutely as that the book can be kept in the kitchen and be used by any domestic who can read as a guide in every one of her employments in the kitchen fourth to furnish such directions in regard to small dinnerparties and evening company as will enable any young housekeeper to perform her part on such occasions with ease comfort and success fifth to present a good supply of the rich and elegant dishes demanded at such entertainments and yet to set forth so large and tempting a variety of what is safe healthful and good in connexion with such warnings and suggestions as it is hoped may avail to promote a more healthful fashion in regard both to entertainments and to daily table supplies no book of this kind will sell without an adequate supply of the rich articles which custom requires and in furnishing them the writer has aimed to follow the example of providence which scatters profusely both good and ill and combines therewith the caution alike of experience revelation and conscience choose ye that which is good that ye and your seed may live sixth in the work on domestic economy together with this to which it is a supplement the writer has attempted to secure in a cheap and popular form for american housekeepers a work similar to an english work which she has examined entitled the encyclopdia of domestic economy by thomas webster and mrs parkes containing over twelve hundred octavo pages of closelyprinted matter treating on every department of domestic economy a work which will be found much more useful to english women who have a plenty of money and welltrained servants than to american housekeepers it is believed that most in that work which would be of any practical use to american housekeepers will be found in this work and the domestic economy lastly the writer has aimed to avoid the defects complained of by most housekeepers in regard to works of this description issued in this country or sent from england such as that in some cases the receipts are so rich as to be both expensive and unhealthful in others that they are so vaguely expressed as to be very imperfect guides in others that the processes are so elaborate and fussing as to make double the work that is needful and in others that the topics are so limited that some departments are entirely omitted and all are incomplete in accomplishing these objects the writer has received contributions of the pen and verbal communications from some of the most judicious and practical housekeepers in almost every section of this country so that the work is fairly entitled to the name it bears of the american housekeepers receipt book the following embraces most of the topics contained in this work suggestions to young housekeepers in regard to style furniture and domestic arrangements suggestions in regard to different modes to be pursued both with foreign and american domestics on providing a proper supply of family stores on the economical care and use of them and on the furniture and arrangement of a storecloset on providing
