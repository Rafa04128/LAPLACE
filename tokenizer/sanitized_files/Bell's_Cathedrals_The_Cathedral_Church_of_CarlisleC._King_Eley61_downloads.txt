sons 1900 w h white and co limited riverside press edinburgh general preface this series of monographs has been planned to supply visitors to the great english cathedrals with accurate and well illustrated guidebooks at a popular price the aim of each writer has been to produce a work compiled with sufficient knowledge and scholarship to be of value to the student of archology and history and yet not too technical in language for the use of an ordinary visitor or tourist to specify all the authorities which have been made use of in each case would be difficult and tedious in this place but amongst the general sources of information which have been almost invariably found useful are1 the great county histories the value of which especially in questions of genealogy and local records is generally recognised 2 the numerous papers by experts which appear from time to time in the transactions of the antiquarian and archological societies 3 the important documents made accessible in the series issued by the master of the rolls 4 the wellknown works of britton and willis on the english cathedrals and 5 the excellent series of handbooks to the cathedrals originated by the late mr john murray to which the reader may in most cases be referred for further detail especially in reference to the histories of the respective sees gleeson white edward f strange authors preface amongst the works consulted in compiling this handbook may be specially mentioned nicolson and burns history and antiquities of westmoreland and cumberland hutchinsons history and antiquities of the city of

details of the founding of the cathedral of carlisle are very precise and clear when william rufus returned southwards after reestablishing the city of carlisle he left as governor a rich norman priest named walter he began at once to build a church to be dedicated to the blessed virgin mary which was to have in connection with it a college of secular canons walter did not however live to see the building finished and henry i took it upon himself to complete the good work it is said that his wife on one hand and his chaplain on the other urged him to do this by the beginning of the twelfth century 1123 he founded and endowed a priory of regular augustinian canons making his chaplain the first prior ten years afterwards1133henry founded the see of carlisle and the priory church became the cathedral at its endowment henry laid on the altar the famous cornu eburneum now lost this horn was given instead of a written document as proof of the grants of tithes its virtue was tried in 1290 when the prior claimed some tithes on land in the forest of inglewood but it was decided that the grant did not originally cover the tithes in dispute the ceremony of investiture with a horn is very ancient and was in use before there were any written charters we read of ulf a danish prince who gave all his lands to the church of york and the form of endowment was this he brought the horn out of which he usually drank and before the high altar kneeling devoutly drank the wine and by that ceremony enfeoffed the church with all his lands and revenues jefferson history of carlisle 171n aldulf or thelwulf was made the first bishop and he placed augustinians in the monastery attached to the cathedral these were called black canons their cassocks cloaks and hoods being of that colour a further difference between them and other monks was that they let their beards grow and covered their heads with caps as a consequence of this order being introduced into the monastery the episcopal chapter was augustinian other english cathedral chapters being generally benedictine on some high ground between the west wall of the city and the road to the castle the cathedral was built the site was nearly square in shape about five acres in extent and was the highest part in carlisle after that on which the castle stood this situation was very advantageous owing to the presence of water near the surface its frontage to the city wall and proximity to the river a narrow piece of ground of about halfanacre extending along the walls and upon which the monastic grounds abutted was in after years given to the priory by its owner robert de eglesfield who was chaplain to philippa wife of henry iii the church was set out almost due east and west diagonally across the northwest part of the site the west end being about 100 feet from the boundary and was finished about 1130 its nave consisted of eight bays and was about 140 feet long there was a very fine west front with a handsome central doorway of four orders the western wall was more than 7 feet in thickness and had four flat pilaster buttresses nearly 7 feet broad and 15 inches deep the nave was provided with north and south aisles covered with highpitched wooden roofs while the north and south transepts were also roofed in a similar manner and a small apsidal chapel projected from the eastern face of each the archway of the south transept apse is now the entrance to st catherines chapel with the exception of the present elaborate entrance to the south transept and the window above it the transept is identical with that of the norman minster the choir was only 80 feet long reaching to the end of the present stalls eastward it terminated in an apse its width can be judged from traces of the original roof still perceptible in the west wall of the present choir in accordance with a frequent arrangement the ritual choir extended westward of the crossing and included the two eastern bays of the nave in the centre was a low square typical norman tower 35 feet square of which the lower parts of the piers remain to allow for the extension of the ritual choir the eastern and western arches of the crossing were carried on corbels white or grey sandstone from quarries in the district was used in the construction of the minster perhaps supplemented by stones from the roman wall stucco was applied to the exterior red lines marking the joints there is no doubt that this stucco has materially helped to keep the norman stonework in a good state of preservation it will be seen then that the original church was a norman minster of moderate size consisting of a nave with north and south aisles a small choir a low square tower and north and south transepts thus it remained till about 1250 when as usually happened the clergy became dissatisfied with the smallness of their choir and a new one was projected on a much larger scale its length was to be equal to the nave while in height and breadth it was to be greater the increased length allowed room for the ritual choir on the east side of the crossing any extension of the cathedral on the south was prevented by the presence of the conventual buildings therefore the north choiraisle was thrown into the choir and a new one added northward of the former one consequence of this alteration is seen by comparing the entrance to each aisle that of the south choir aisle is the original norman arch while the entrance to the north aisle is a beautiful late thirteenthcentury arch decorated the corresponding norman arch of the north aisle has been blocked up but is still easily traced another consequence is that the extension having taken place on one side only the eastern arch of the tower fills but a part of the west end of the choir the choir arch consequently is symmetrically placed with regard to the roof of the nave but not with the choir roof and the central line of the choir does not coincide with that of the nave for though the south wall of the choir is in a line with the south wall of the nave the choir being 12 feet broader than the nave the axis of the former is to the north of the axis of the nave the view from the east end looking towards the nave is quite spoiled by this want of symmetry not very much remains today of this thirteenthcentury early english choir in 1292 just as it had been roofed in a terrible fire the most disastrous the cathedral has ever experienced destroyed everything except the outer walls of the aisles the graceful lancet windows and the beautiful cinquefoiled arcading beneath them belfry and bells too shared in the destruction one hundred years passed away while a new choir was being built bishop halton 12921325 a very energetic prelate and a great favourite of edward i began the work and laboured at it for quite thirty years and was followed by bishops kirkby welton and appleby it was arranged to rebuild the choir on a still larger scale a bay being added and the east end rebuilt from the foundation the general plan of the earlier work of the aisles was followed in the new bay the glory of the cathedralthe great east window which marks a distinct transition in artwas also projected but at this time only carried up as high as the top of the choir arches the wall arcade and the lancet windows above were repaired and later work of a more elaborate character added the great arches and the groin ribs of the aisle ceilings were underset with new pillars so that we get early english arches of the thirteenth century on decorated pillars of the fourteenth century after some years interval building was resumed about 1350 the decorated portions of the choir were now put in hand the triforium clerestory and upper part of the east end as well as the tracery and much of the mouldings of the east window and the roof the carving hitherto unfinished was now completed but as the style had developed in the meantime we once more find examples of decidedly early work with much later work both above and below the roof inside was finished with a very fine panelled ceiling the building was finished 13751400 and in the roof were placed the arms of those who had helped in the rebuildingthe lacys the nevilles and the percys the material used for the new choir was red sandstone both for the interior and the exterior giving in some cases a curious patched appearance to the walls illustration the cathedral and precincts from an old plan in lysons magna britannia about 13801384 the east window was filled with glass in 1392 the cathedral once again suffered from fire and the damage was repaired by bishop strickland 140019 no efforts appear to have been made to bring the nave into correspondence with the extended choir and the end of the thirteenth century marks the close of the cathedrals history in the direction of its enlargement and beautifying on a review of the cathedral we find in the aisles thirteenthcentury work on a small scale in its perfection the south aisle shows development of window tracery and the gradual steps taken towards uniting single lights under one arch tracery carried to its perfection can be seen in the east window early english carving is shown in st catherines chapel especially in the corbels and the more naturalistic carving which was developed at a later period is exhibited in the corbels of the roof of the choir and the capitals of the piers the latter afford the most complete representation of the seasons known to exist on the south side from east to west are the first six months and on the north side west to east the remainder about 1401 william strickland being bishop of carlisle the tower was rebuilt on its original scale probably because the foundations would not permit one to be erected proportioned to the size of the choir it was capped by a short wooden spire covered with lead this however was removed in the seventeenth century the fortysix stalls in the choir erected on a plinth of red sandstone belong to this period 140119 the elaborate tabernacle work by prior haithwaite 1433 was originally gilded and coloured and the niches were filled with images prior gondibour 14841507 painted the backs of the stalls the remains of some screens he added to the choir may still be seen in st catherines chapel he had the roof painted in red green and gold on a white ground painted the choir pillars white diapered with red roses nearly 12 inches in diameter and with the letters ihc and jm in gold and no doubt finished whatever decorative work of the choir still had to be done laurence salkeld last prior and first dean erected the very fine renaissance screen on the north side of the choir near the pulpit it bears his initials followed by the letters dk decanus karliolensis of his new title the priory was surrendered to the crown in january 1540 and the last priorsalkeldwas made dean of the chapter founded by henry viii the revenue was at that time estimated at 481 per annum five years later june 1545 the present foundation was settled and the dedication changed to that of the holy and undivided trinity we get a glimpse of the cathedral in the first half of the seventeenth century in the record left by some officers who visited the english cathedrals in 1634 carlisle they curtly speak of as more like a great wilde country church than a fair and stately cathedral after the capture of the city in 1645 the parliamentary troops pulled down part of the nave in order to repair the fortifications it is very probable that the norman church was partly built of stones taken from the roman wall and it is strange to find the western part of the same church being destroyed nearly six hundred years after in order to repair the city walls george fox the intrepid founder of the society of friends came to carlisle in 1653 and preached in the cathedral some of the congregation being opposed to him he was guarded while preaching by certain soldiers and friends who had heard him gladly at length the rude people of the city rushed into the building and made a tumult so that the governor was forced to send musketeers to quell it fox thus describes the scene in his journal from thence we came to carlisle on the firstday following i went into the steeplehouse and after the priest had done i preached the truth to the people and declared the word of life amongst them the priest got away and the magistrates desired me to go out of the steeplehouse but i still declared the way of the lord unto them and told them i came to speak the word of life and salvation from the lord amongst them the power of the lord was dreadful amongst them in the steeplehouse so that the people trembled and shook and they thought the steeplehouse shook and some of them feared it would fall down on their heads the magistrates wives were in a rage and strove mightily to be at me but the soldiers and friendly people stood thick about me at length the rude people of the city rose and came with staves and stones into the steeplehouse crying down with these roundheaded rogues and they threw stones whereupon the governor sent a file or two of musketeers into the steeplehouse to appease the tumult and commanded all the other soldiers out so those soldiers took me by the hand in a friendly manner and said they would have me along with them when we came forth into the street the city was in an uproar and the governor came down and some of those soldiers were put in prison for standing by me and for me against the townspeople the next day the justices and magistrates of the town granted a warrant against me and sent for me to come before them after a large examination they committed me to prison as a blasphemer a heretic and a seducer though they could not justly charge any such thing against me fuller about 1660 describes the building as black but comely still bearing the remaining signes of its former burning further mischief was also done to the building by the jacobite prisoners who were lodged in it after the defeat of the young pretender in the latter half of the eighteenth century some attempts were made at restoring the cathedral but they for the most part consisted of hiding the beautiful choir roof with a stucco groined ceiling and plentifully whitewashing the building the roof was elegantly vaulted with wood but this failing by length of time together with the lead roof the dean and chapter some few years ago new laid the roof and the ceiling being totally ruined and destroyed they in the year 1764 contracted for a stucco groined ceiling and for cleaning and whitening the whole church and finding the new lead much torn and broken by wind for want of a ceiling underneath the upper tire of that was done again and a coping added to the rigging and thus proceeding from one repair to another the whole expence hath amounted to upwards of 13001 1 nicholson and burn page 249 eastward of the stalls the choir was formerly separated from the aisles by screens of elaborate tracery work when the cathedral was repaired and beautified as just described they were removed to outbuildings and by far the greater part lost or destroyed the cathedral was restored 18537 in good taste at a cost of about 15000 mr ewan christian the architect of the ecclesiastical commissioners undertook the work and happily succeeded in counteracting the repairing and beautifying of 1764 carlisle is not a large or notable cathedral but its delightful early english choir with its magnificent east window will ever redeem it from being insignificant or uninteresting chapter ii the exterior on examining the north side of the cathedral it is apparent that more than one plan has been followed in the construction of the building as it stands there are the remains of a norman nave whose roof is lower than the choir roof the choir is early english with clerestory windows and the easternmost bay the retrochoir late decorated while the tower is perpendicular in the north window of the north transept we have a specimen of work of the nineteenth century thus the cathedral supplies examples of architecture from the norman period down to the present time the moderate height of the nave 65 ft and the treatment of its details are quite characteristic of the best work of the period when it was erected the bays of the aisle are separated by flat buttresses about five and a half feet wide projecting nearly one foot beyond the wall and the parapet wall in which they terminate is supported above the windows by a corbel table of shields and trefoil heads2 2 these date from about 1400 upon the stringcourse which runs along the wall unbroken by the buttresses there is in each bay a window with a circular head flanked by single columns a ringlike ornament is used as a decoration for one of the mouldings of the arch these windows except the one above the doorway are restorations the doorway itself which leads into the nave is modern imitated from the norman window the clerestory in each compartment has a window which differs from the aisle windows in having the billet as decoration of its outer moulding the stringcourse at the spring of the round head runs without a break from one to the other there is also an unbroken corbel table above the windows of very expressive lifelike heads no two of which are alike illustration the cathedral from the north a pumphrey photo north transeptthe north window is debased gothic the tracery of the previous window having been similar to that of the great east window while the west window is early english illustration north door of nave a pumphrey photo the tower the latest part of the cathedral was the work of bishop strickland early in the fifteenth century he erected it upon the piers of the ancient norman tower its height is not much over 100 feet and is very disappointing because in england cathedral towers are apt to be good and really make their mark pater in fact it does not at all give the impression of being part of such an important building as a cathedral this is caused by its having been rebuilt on the scale of the norman nave and not on that of the enlarged choir it takes up only about twothirds of the width of the choir and to mask this defect a turret rising to the top of the third stage of the tower is introduced on the north side and another turret is added at the northeast angle the tower rises in four stages above the transepts the second storey is pierced with loopholes the third has two pointed windows lighting a room immediately below the belfry between these in a niche with a canopy is the figure of an angel holding a drawn sword on his head is fixed a tablet to support another figure there is only one window in the fourth storey which gives light to the belfry and is very large its labels are ornamented with very vigorously carved heads and the cornice above is decorated very much like that of the clerestory the tower terminates in an embattled parapet all the windows have been thrown out of centre by the addition of the lower turret originally the tower was crowned by a leaden spire about fifteen feet in height but this was removed at the end of the seventeenth century on account of its decayed condition on the east side of the tower there is a single window in the third storey in place of a second window there is an opening into the roof of the choir this leads into a passage running from the tower to the east end the bold attempts to veil the inadequate size of the tower by the addition of two turrets can be best studied from this side the north aisle of the choir consists of eight bays all early english except the easternmost one the retrochoir which is late decorated while the western bay has a perpendicular window sometime in the fifteenth century the third bay from the east in each aisle was altered and a large perpendicular window inserted in order to admit more light to the sanctuary during the restoration of the cathedral these later windows were removed and replaced by careful copies of the other early english windows the basement is composed of bold mouldings with a plain wall equivalent in height to the internal wall arcade over this a stringcourse runs uninterruptedly round the choir just below the windows illustration the south door see p 21 a pumphrey photo each compartment has an arcade of four lancetshaped divisions the external ones blank while the internal divisions which are wider than the others form the window the slender banded shafts are detached which is rather unusual and have moulded bases and capitals the bands divide the shafts into unequal lengths the lower portion being the shorter the arch mouldings are good owing to the fact that the blank arches are more acutely pointed their outer mouldings terminate higher than the mouldings of the internal arches towards the east end small heads and bosses of foliage ornament the junction of these mouldings above these the cornice and parapet rest upon blocks bearing the nailhead ornament illustration elevation of east end the second bay from the east is divided into three equal spaces with a very narrow acute angle on the right a series of fine gabled buttresses gives relief to the exterior of the choir on each side the windows of the clerestory have very rich mouldings and also afford fine examples of flowing tracery each bay has an arch with three divisions the central one higher and wider than the others on this side onlythe norththe base is ornamented with trefoils there is a cornice above the windows extending from the tower to the east end it is richly decorated with heads and the ballflower ornament which is characteristic of fourteenthcentury work it is broken here and there by gargoyles projecting almost three feet from the wall the parapet makes but a poor show in comparison with the rich windows and cornice as the choir never had a groined ceiling there was no necessity for flying buttresses and their absence gives the clerestory a very monotonous flat effect this is further intensified by the window tracery being level with the wall the architraves having no depth of moulding round them some years ago the aisles and clerestory were skilfully refaced and consequently the exteriors have a very modern appearance east of the retrochoir is the exterior of a staircase leading from the north choir aisle to the clerestory parapet it terminates in a highlyfinished octagonal turret whose parapet is enriched with a running trefoil ornament resembling that on the base of the clerestory windows the northeastern and the small east buttresses terminate just beneath in gables richly ornamented with minute crockets the panelling of the former is rather like the decoration of the central portion of the east end east endan irregularity in designing the east end has been covered by placing the great buttresses so as to make the pediment appear irregular and the cross at the apex seems consequently not to be in the centre of the choir while in fact it is the great east window with the gable window over it that is out of position the sill of the east window is unusually near the ground and it is flanked by substantial buttresses finely pinnacled each buttress contains two niches with beautifully carved canopies the base of the lower ones being a trifle higher than the springing of the arch they display fulllength statues of st peter st paul st james and st john a staircase crossing over the east window in the thickness of the wall receives light from the triangular window enclosing three trefoils which appears in the gable immediately beneath this trinity windowas it is calledis a richlycanopied niche adorned with a statue of the virgin mary bearing in her arms the holy child the summit of the gable is crowned by a large richlyfloriated cross and on each side are four smaller ones with crockets of foliage between them illustration the east end photochrom co ltd photo in spite of the fact that the east end has been almost entirely rebuilt it is a remarkably good example of late decorated work and it would be difficult to find its equal in england the wall of the north aisle is higher than the south aisle because of a passage between the staircases the buttresses do not rise above the parapet and are finished off with richlypanelled gables ornamented with crockets and finials the end of the south aisle is decorated with corbels and parapet like the choir and with pinnacled buttresses on the south side of the choir the first three bays from the east end are practically the same as those on the north side the remaining windows including those of st catherines chapel on the east of the south transept are early english but of later date and not so pleasing as the others instead of two lights they are furnished with three some of these have small circular openings in the spandrels over the mullions filled with stained glass the fifth compartment against which a vestry was formerly built shows traces of a door and over that a passage probably connected originally with some of the conventual buildings the grotesque gargoyles these wild faces these images of beasts and men carved upon spouts and gutters are very vigorously executed the windows on the south side of the clerestory are without the trefoil which ornaments the base of those on the north side the blank window next to the tower is also wanting in other respects the clerestory presents the same features as on the north south transeptthe chapterhouse and cloisters formerly adjoined the south transept and there was probably an entrance from the chapterhouse leading down a flight of stairs into the transept billings says the modern casing at the base of the end of the transept about 12 ft high shews the height of the cloisters and the doorway above the level of the chapterhouse floor from this it would seem that the cathedral was entered at the south transept from the chapterhouse by a flight of steps the foundation of the south wall having been shaken by the removal of the remains of the conventual buildings massive buttresses were added and a very richly sculptured doorway inserted between them 1856 it was designed by mr christian and is the principal entrance to the cathedral its character is that of the late work of the choir and is somewhat out of keeping with this distinctively norman portion of the building the window over the entrance is of the same date the west side of the transept is lighted by two plain roundheaded windows not quite central the outer moulding of the window arch of the south transept clerestory has billet ornament above this is a corbel table of heads and mouldings which interferes with the upper window mouldings the transept compartments differ from those of the nave by the addition of a flat buttress between each which consequently breaks the continuity of the corbel table as the side of the nave was covered by the conventual buildings it was of plainer character than the north and had no buttresses between the windows the clerestory is exactly the same as on the north the foundations of the old west wall are behind one of the prebendarys houses to the west of the nave the west end as it stands at present was restored by mr christian a local sandstone was used in the construction of the building grey or white in the norman portion and red in the other parts this red sandstone is not so good for exterior as for interior work because it is liable to perish by the action of the weather illustration the nave south side gw wilson co photo chapter iii the interior the cathedral now consists of part of the original nave the two eastern bays only with aisles and north and south transepts without aisles but with a chapel on the east side of the south transept the central tower and the choir with north and south aisles and ambulatory or retrochoir the naveentering by the modern doorway on the north we are at once in the fragmentary nave of early norman work its present length is about 38 feet and width about 60 feet in 1645 the scots destroyed about 100 feet of the nave and it has never been rebuilt this mutilation has had a serious effect upon the proportions of the building and induces a feeling of want of balance the open timber roof raised to the original height was substituted at the restoration for a flat ceiling which had been put up at a previous embellishment of the cathedral bishop walkelin made use of similar roofs in winchester cathedral 10701097 the triforium 114050 has in each compartment a semicircular arch entirely without ornament the clerestory consists of three arches supported by columns with carved capitals the centre arch which is larger than the other is lighted at the back by a roundheaded window we may say that the nave is propped with pillars of prodigious girth they are massive circular columns nearly six feet in diameter and support semicircular arches the capitals of those on the south side are carved with leaf ornament the rest are plain against the wall between each arch is a semicircular engaged shaft reaching to the base of the triforium the arches near the tower have been partly crushed owing to the shifting of the tower piers caused by faulty foundations about 1870 the west end of the nave was restored by mr christian the window is filled with glass in memory of the rev c vernon harcourt canon and prebendary of

doorway now blocked up formerly led from the cloisters into the nave up to the year 1870 the nave was used as a parish church the cathedral from its beginning as the priory church in accordance with a very common practice of the augustinian body contained two churches belonging to two separate bodies quite independent of each other the choir and transepts formed the priory church in the possession of the prior and canons until the dissolution of the monastery when it passed to the dean and chapter the nave formed the parish church of st mary and belonged to the parishioners after the civil wars it was cut off from the transepts by a stone wall and furnished with galleries and a pulpit a new church to accommodate the parishioners having been built in the abbey grounds in 1870 all these additions were removed and the nave was restored to the cathedral adding greatly to the general effect an interesting event in the history of the parish church was the marriage of sir walter scott to miss carpenter on the 24th december 1797 he had made the acquaintance of miss carpenter at gilsland in july while touring in the lake district she had a form that was fashioned as light as a fays a complexion of the clearest and lightest olive eyes large deepset and dazzling of the finest italian brown and a profusion of silken tresses black as the ravens wing scott was strongly attracted to her and within six months she became his wife a tombstone under the west window shows the matrix of what was once a magnificent brass the font standing on a fine marble flooring close to the west window

fletcher chancellor of carlisle died 1846 this window exhibits plate tracerytracery cut as it were out of a flat plate of stone without mouldings not built up in sections it is the transitional link between the lancet and tracery systems the doorway in the corner communicates with the transept roof the north window is very large and is filled with stained glass in memory of five children of ac tait dean of carlisle afterwards archbishop of canterbury they all died of scarlet fever in the short space of five weeks 6th march to 9th april 1858 this end of the transept was till quite recently railed off and used as the consistory court of the chancellor of carlisle originally the transept had a chapel on the eastern side opening with a single arch similar to st catherines chapel in the south transept the opening to the north choir aisle is decorated in style above this is a portion of an arch for buttressing the towerarches illustration view across the transepts in 1840 from billings to the right is the blockedup entrance of the old norman choir aisle an exact counterpart of the present south choir aisle entrance the roof is now an open timber one of the original pitch near the northeast pier of the tower is a well completely covered over this it is said was done by a former dean on the supposition that the well or the water in some occult fashion affected the music in the cathedral the tower was rebuilt by bishop strickland 140019 who used the norman piers and placed upon them other columns of about the same length the early norman piers have squarefluted capitals and are a little higher than the arches of the nave the added columns have capitals carved with birds and foliage and are carried up to the arches of the tower this rebuilding was rendered necessary by the shifting of its foundations the piers sank nearly one foot and the arches near them have been to some extent distorted springs of water are said to run across the transept from north to south and this may explain the sinking which probably happened before the erection of the present choir clustered columns uphold the transept arches but the western and eastern arches are supported on each side by a single column terminating in a bracket at about the level of the base of the triforium this was arranged so as to increase the width of the passage between the piers from the choir to the nave the decoration of the eastern arch capitals consists of the badges of the percy familythe crescent and fetterlock hotspur was governor of the town and warden of the marches under henry iv and it is probable that he aided in the work of the bishop the western arch capitals have as decoration the rose and escallop shell alternatelybadges of the dacres and nevilles who also may have been benefactors to the cathedral across the north transept from the upper capitals is a depressed arch of stone with perpendicular tracery south transeptwith the exception of the wall itself the south arm of the transept is modern the ancient wall eight feet thick is quite suitable for a fortress a richlydecorated modern doorway has been made and above it is a window by powell representing the days of creation illustration part of south transept and st catherines chapel from billings the west wall is out of the perpendicular through the shifting of the tower piers and the norman arch opening to the south aisle of the nave has also been distorted to the left is a roundheaded window filled with glass in memory of the rev w vansittart canon and prebendary of carlisle 1824 the triforium has a plain rounded opening the clerestory is very much like that of the nave but is not so regular in construction the architecture being merely massive and destitute of ornament except in the case of the capitals which are very sparingly decorated on the east side of the transept the second arch from the doorway is the entrance to the south choir aisle it is norman ornamented with a simply executed but very pleasing zigzag the capitals of the piers are cushioned on the whole it is much the same as the arch immediately opposite opening on the south aisle of the nave all this side of the transept with the exception of the small doorway which was built a few years later dates from about 1101 st catharines chapelbetween the choir aisle entrance and the modern doorway is another norman arch which is the entrance to st catherines chapela chantry of early decorated style erected on the walls of a former norman building jefferson says in most large churches altars distinct from that in the chancel were founded by wealthy and influential individuals at which masses might be sung for the repose of the dead the portion thus set apart which was generally the east end of one of the aisles was then denominated a chantry in it the tomb of the founder was generally placed and it was separated from the rest of the church by a screen in the fourteenth century this custom greatly increased and small additional side aisles and transepts were often annexed to churches and called mortuary chapels these were used indeed as chantries but they were more independent in their constitution and in general more ample in their endowments the dissolution of all these foundations followed soon after that of the monasteries in the year 1422 bishop whelpdale at his death left the sum of 200 for the purpose of founding and endowing a chantry for the performance of religious offices for the souls of sir thomas skelton knight and mr john glaston two gentlemen with whom he had been on terms of intimate friendship and who were buried in the cathedral nicholson thinks it probable this was the chantry of st roch its revenues were valued at 2 14s per annum illustration one bay of the nave there was another chantry dedicated to st cross but the period at which and the person by whom it was founded are not known it was granted by edward vi with all messuages lands tenements profits and hereditaments belonging thereto valued at 3 19s per annum to henry tanner and thomas bucher the chapel of st catherine in the cathedral of carlisle was founded at an early period by john de capella a wealthy citizen and endowed by him with certain rents lands and burgage houses in the year 1366 a portion of its revenues being fraudulently detained bishop appleby commanded the chaplains of st marys and st cuthberts to give public notice that the offenders were required to make restitution within ten days on pain of excommunication with bell book and candle its revenues according to the rotuli called the kings books which were made up in the reign of henry viii were valued at 3 2s 8d per annum3 3 history of carlisle page 158 some very fine foliated brackets can be seen in the arch between this chapel and the choir aisle dividing the chapel from the transept and aisle is some exquisite carved screenwork late decorated dating from the latter part of the fifteenth century and attributed to prior gondibour its great beauty and the skilful variations of the designs will repay careful inspection the chapel now serves as a vestry for the clergy but it is to be regretted that it cannot add to the beauty of the cathedral by being utilised for its proper purpose the pointed doorway on the left originally opened on to a well which was closed in the course of the restoration of the building the position of carlisle on the border making it liable to sudden attacks in early times it is probable that the inhabitants may have taken sanctuary in the cathedral many a time when a well of water would be of great advantage to the refugees monuments in the transeptsnorth transept near the entrance to the north choir aisle stands the altartomb of prior senhouse it is covered with a slab of dark blue marble an inscription runs thus the tomb of simon senhouse prior of carlisle in the reign of henry vii the original inscription being lost the present plate was substituted by the senior male branch of the senhouse family ad 1850 motto lothe to offend it was on this tomb that the tenants of the priory were accustomed to pay their rents south transepton a stone in the west wall now covered with a pane of glass is an inscription which was discovered in 1853 it is written in norse runes and is as follows tolfihn yraita thasi rynr a thisi stain tolfihn wrote these runes on this stone the runes are norse not anglosaxon the latter are not often found but the former are scarcer still the runes perhaps date from the eleventh century illustration screenst catherines chapel from billings there is also a marble tablet containing a medallion likeness of george moore a man of rare strength and simplicity of character of active benevolence and wide influence a yeomans son he was not born to wealth but by ability and industry he gained it and he ever used it as a steward of god and a disciple of the lord jesus christ for the furtherance of all good works george moore was born at mealsgate cumberland the 9th april 1806 he went to london in 1825 two years later he was working for fisher stroud robinson lace merchants as town traveller and soon after as traveller in the north of england he was so successful that he was nicknamed the napoleon of watling street when he was twentythree he accepted an offer from a firm of lace merchants groucock copestake to become a partner he gave up travelling for orders in 1841 but soon suffered in health as a remedy he took to following the hounds and later in 1844 went on a three months trip to america on his return he started on his career of philanthropy which has made him famous a few of the institutions for which he worked and to which he contributed largely may be mentioned the cumberland benevolent society the commercial travellers schools the british home for incurables the warehousemen and clerks schools the royal free hospital and the london city mission various cumberland charities found in him a generous supporter he met with his death in carlisle knocked down by a runaway horse 20th november 1876 while on his way to attend a meeting of the nurses institution he died the next day from his injuries the following was a favourite motto with him what i spent i had what i saved i lost what i gave i have illustration the choir looking west a pumphrey photo there is a memorial tablet to robert anderson the cumberland bard 17701833 born in carlisle he had but little schooling and at ten years of age he was earning wages as assistant to a calico printer later he was bound apprentice to a patterndrawer in his native city he went to london to pursue his calling and he seems to have been led to attempt to write poetry through hearing some imitation scottish songs sung at vauxhall he published his first volume in 1798 and his cumberland ballads in 1805 his verses not altogether destitute of real poetry are valuable for the pictures they give of obsolete manners and customs of the district the choira low doorway in the eastern arch of the tower gives entrance to the choir some of the woodwork of the stalls fills the lower part of this arch and the entrance has been placed towards the north so as to open exactly on the centre of the choir in point of beauty the choir compares favourably with any we possess in england and the eye can rest upon it again and again with renewed satisfaction and delight its superb main arcade with the boldlydesigned and finelycarved capitals representing the twelve months of the yearunrivalled in this country its handsome clerestory windows its great east window the pride of the cathedral and overhead its richlycoloured roof unique in shape afford a combination not easily to be surpassed the choir is about 134 feet long 34 feet 6 inches wide between the columns and 72 feet 6 inches between the aisle walls the nave is not so wide by about 12 feet and as the columns of both nave and choir on the south side are on the same line the extra width is all on the north looking westward the view is marred by the tower arch not being in the centre of the west wall in consequence of which there is an ugly space of blank wall between the arch and the north choir aisle there are eight bays averaging about 18 feet in width those at the end however east and west are not so wide at the east they probably suffer from the intrusion of the east wall which is about six feet thick the western bays may have lost the space taken for the choir entrance they have very acute arches and at the west end rest on responds or halfpiers against the tower walls those at the east end rest on brackets and their mouldings lose themselves in the wall on each side of the great window the presbytery is reached by two steps from the choir and the last bay but one in which the altar stands is raised three steps above the presbytery the main arcade practically dates from after the terrible fire in 1292 the arches escaped and are splendid specimens of early english of the pointed style in all the purity of its first period they were underbuilt with early decorated piers while the capitals were finished at the same time as the triforium and clerestory late decorated 13501400 the piers are not equal in diameter to those of the nave they measure but five feet and a quarter each consists of eight clustered pillars of red sandstone the four facing the cardinal points of the compass are larger than the intermediate ones which are filleted the base moulding is very deep and hollow these piers support the early english arches with dogtooth ornament large in the interior small in the exterior altogether these fine arches give a very pleasing impression of lightness and grace and make us feel the fascination of the pointed style at the junctions of the arches are small grotesque heads very well executed on the north side where the presbytery begins is a queens head and on the opposite side a figure with a dogs head there are altogether fourteen complete and two half piers the capitals of which are carved with foliage alone or with the addition of winged monsters birds beasts and human figures twelve of them represent the domestic and agricultural occupations of the months the first capital on the south side east end shows a creature with a mans head wings and a tail terminating in the head of a serpent which bites the monster on the temple january is symbolised on the next one and the series continues westward then crosses over and proceeds from west to east on the north side finishing at the last pier but one januarya

who is about to fell an ox which another man holds by the horns in addition there is a man tending swine the last capital shows several heads and a man sitting on a tree stump in each bay of the triforium there are three arches with curvilinear tracery the principal mullions have octagonal bases on account of their reduced width the extreme eastern and western bays have only two arches the courses of stone above the base of the triforium are not by any means so smooth and wellproportioned as those beneath the workmen do not seem to have been actuated by the spirit of those builders in the elder days of art who wrought with greatest care each minute and unseen part for the gods see everywhere illustration the choir looking east in 1840 from billings the clerestory consists of two planes each compartment on the face of the choir wall has three highpitched arches the middle one being higher than those at the side and more than twice as wide in the opening the eastern bay has only the central arch while the western bay is blank the base is decorated with a low parapet pierced with quatrefoils four in the centre and two in each side opening on the south however the quatrefoil decoration is slightly different there are only three quatrefoils in the centre and two smaller ones on each side this parapet is in great part a restoration the original having been almost entirely removed in the vain hope of admitting more light to the lower part of the choir in the other plane the windows are in triplets three lights in the central and single lights on either side decorated with flamboyant tracery the eastern bay has no side lights although the windows seem to be all different there are but six varieties distributed as follows on the north side beginning at the east the design of the first window is not repeated that of the next window occurs in the second window on the south side the third and fifth are alike the sixth and the last are like the fourth the design of the seventh window does not occur again on the south side one new pattern appears in three windowsthe first fourth and sixth from the east the second is like the window opposite and the third fifth and seventh are like the third on the north side of all the windows the second from the east is the most beautiful before 1764 they were filled with stained glass of which some remains are still to be seen the trefoil heads above the mullions have a brown border with the insertion in some cases of a yellow diamond ornament and in others of a crown the roofthis unique specimen of a waggonheaded ceiling semicircular in all its parts is of oak bishop welton began its construction about 1350 a plaster ceiling put up in the year 1764 hid this fine timber roof until its removal in 1856 it was then found that enough remained of the original to allow a faithful restoration to be made but the scheme of colouringred and green upon whitewas not copied in its stead owen jones suggested anothera background of blue plentifully ornamented with golden stars the saturday review is responsible for the statementfor the truth of which however it does not vouchthat on the first occasion when dean close found himself beneath the roof then glowing in all the brilliancy of modern painting and gilding in semblance of the spangled firmament on high he solemnly ejaculated oh my stars at the triforium base foliated brackets support vaulting shafts of three clustered columns at the point of contact with the base of the quatrefoil parapet they are ornamented with rings and their capitals are foliated but not so naturally as the capitals below great semicircular rafters spring from the capitals and cross the choir smaller rafters start from the cornice of the clerestory these are intersected in the centre of the ceiling by a longitudinal beam small moulded ribs divide the space between each great rafter and the longitudinal beam into sixteen panels the intersections are decorated with carved bosses hammerbeamsfrom the foot of three of the principal ribs hammerbeams project they seem to indicate an intention on the part of the builders to cover the choir with an opentimber roof like that of the great hall at westminster but having decided on the waggonheaded roof they did not trouble to remove these beams wall pieces and curved struts now connect them with the vaulting shafts and they have been decorated with carvd angels ever eagereyed with hair blown back and wings put crosswise on their breasts more than one hundred carved figures ornament the cornice and the following texts in blackletter appear above them north sidekeep thy foot when thou goest to the house of the lord eccles v 1 lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord ps

xciii 5 the great east window is the crowning ornament and special glory of the cathedral it is unsurpassed by any other in the kingdom perhaps there is not a window equal to it in the whole world rickman says it is one of the finest if not the finest decorated window in the kingdom its elegance of composition and the easy flow of its lines rank it even higher than the celebrated west window of york which it also excels in the number of divisions the window is by far the most free and brilliant example of decorated tracery in the kingdom fergusson in his history of architecture also praises it its upper part exhibits the most beautiful and perfect design for window tracery in the world all the parts are in such just harmony the one to the otherthe whole is so constructively appropriate and at the same time so artistically elegantthat it stands quite alone even among windows of its own age the stonework of all this part the east window is entirely new although it reproduces most minutely the original design king 2023 the whole of the mouldings both of the mullions and tracery externally are nearly destroyed owing to the perishable nature of the stone with which it is constructed billing p 60 1840 this great window almost entirely fills the east end of the choir being 51 feet high from the sill to the top of the tracery and about 26 feet wide in the clear immediately after the fire in 1292 the work was started and the jambs with their slender shafts and foliated capitals were erected nothing more was done till about the middle of the fourteenth century when the arch mullions were added and the tracery dates from about the end of the same century the mouldings were left unfinished until the restoration of the cathedral 1856 the tracery decorated is composed of eightysix pieces struck from 263 centres some of the pieces forming the chief divisions are nearly five feet in length although the stonework is modern the design has been most faithfully copied from the original in the lower part there are nine lights no other decorated window in existence having so many the west window of durham cathedral partly copied from but inferior to the west window of york and the rose window in the south transept at lincoln are of the same character but that of york ranks next in importance and is the only window able to compete with the east window of carlisle the design consists of two complete compositions united under one head by interposing a third the york window on the contrary is altogether one complete design from which no part can be separated without breaking the integrity of the composition the width of the opening is the same in both windows but while the actual tracery of the york window is more than two feet higher the carlisle window is greatly superior in the beautiful arch mouldings above its tracery and also in the side shafts and mouldings again some stiffness is imparted to the design of the york window by the central mullion which reaches from the basement to the top of the arch the tracery branches outwards from this on each side and depends upon the arch for support while the tracery in the carlisle window is not so dependent neither in skilful workmanship nor in variety of ornament is the york window equal to that at carlisle with the exception of four quatrefoils placed above each alternate mullion it is composed of trefoils carlisle on the contrary possesses nine quatrefoils in addition to four placed like those at york nearly all the small spandrels formed by the various ornaments are perforated and this imparts a remarkable air of lightness to the window the beautiful stained glass in the tracery is all that remains of the ancient glass it is of the time of richard ii and was no doubt preserved because of the expense that reglazing its small intricate forms would have involved the subject is a doomthe resurrection the last judgment and the new jerusalem we have our lord sitting in judgment the procession of the blessed to the palace of heaven the place of punishment for the wicked and the general resurrection the figure of our saviour is in the uppermost quatrefoil of the central compartment his countenance will bear the closest inspection it exhibits evident traces of suffering but is calm severe and dignified his head is surrounded by a cruciform nimbus below this are two quatrefoils easily distinguished by their silvery appearance these represent the procession of the redeemed to the heavenly jerusalem whose towers and pavilions are shown in the quatrefoil to the right st peter stands in the gateway in an attitude of welcome at his feet flows the river of life which some of the redeemed have reached the red glare of the place of punishment makes it easy to be distinguished the tortures represented are of the most realistic character and the devils are very material beings with tails hoofs and horns the rest of the picture is occupied with the representation of the general resurrectionthe dead rising from their gravesecclesiastics are vested but laity rise naked though kings wear their crowns several bishops are among the crowd and a pope wearing the triple tiara some of the ecclesiastics are bearded and probably are intended for canons of the cathedral who being austin or black canons would wear their beards in one of the quatrefoils just above the mullions is a figure surrounded by a heraldic border this represents john of gaunt who was governor of carlisle from 1380 to 1384 it is said that he supported the prior william de dalston who refused obedience to the bishop and had been excommunicated and that out of gratitude he was thus represented in the east window4 4 guide to the cathedral of carlisle by rh and kh illustration the choir and east window a pumphrey photo a jesse which originally filled the lower part of the window was destroyed at the reformation the present glass was inserted in 1861 in memory of bishop percy d 1856 it represents events in the history of our lord although the colours do not harmonise well with the old glass they are in accord with the gorgeous colouring of the ceiling like most of the stained glass in the cathedral this is by hardman of birmingham illustration miserere south side of the stalls from billings bishop strickland 13991413 erected the stalls which are of black oak and occupy the three western bays of the choir our english cathedrals are far ahead of foreign cathedrals in the beauty and richness of the tabernacle work of their stalls which in many instances are like a whole wood say a thicket of old hawthorn with its topmost branches spared slowly transformed into stalls these in carlisle if not among the finest specimens in england certainly take very high rank there are fortysix compartments divided by fifty columns upon which the tabernacle work rests each compartment consists of a large canopy decorated with quatrefoils and battlemented this is surmounted by three smaller canopies and pedestals which were originally occupied by small carved figures a large pinnacle richly decorated like the others with crockets and finials finishes the compartment between each stall is a small buttress beginning at the capital and finishing somewhat beneath the top of the large pinnacle these buttresses have alternately a pedestal with a canopy above and a pedestal supporting a small flyingbuttress terminating in a pinnacle enriched with small crockets prior haithwaite is said to have added the tabernaclework after the year 1430 the division between each stall shows either a wellexecuted foliated ornament or an angel in the northwest and southwest angles the elbows of the seats are carved with the head of a king supposed to represent henry iv the panels of the desks are elaborately worked and the stone plinth which supports them is decorated with quatrefoils the stalls at the west end of the choir are wider than the others and are used by the higher dignitaries of the cathedral the deans stall is on the left of the choir entrance and the bishops on the right this arrangement is said to have existed since the time of thelwulf he was the first prior and upon his elevation to the bishopric he still kept the priors seat the hinged seats known as misereres or misericordes were constructed to keep the monks from falling asleep while at prayers the carvings beneath these seats are of different designs generally grotesque the following is a list of the subjects found carved thereon north side a dragon swallowing a man bird and young dragon and lions three dragons one with a human face winged figure with a tabour dragon devouring a bird coronation of the virgin three griffins pelican in its act of

beast mermaid dragon and lion in combat the salkeld screenon the north side of the choir the westernmost bay of the presbytery is filled by a fine wooden screen of renaissance work erected about 1542 by lancelot salkeld last prior and first dean of carlisle it is divided into three compartments through the central one entrance could be gained to the choir formerly by an ascent of three steps from the north choir aisle it is very elaborate and some portions are very beautiful the lower part is panelled each panel having two heads carved in basrelief the upper part is of wellexecuted tracery work over each compartment is a pediment decorated in the centre with shields the western one has been restored the initials ls and dk lancelot salkeld decanus karliolensis occur on the screen the other bays were originally filled with screenwork similar to that in st catherines chapel in 1764 these screens were removed and stored in the fratry crypt as lumber in the end they were used as firewood only a few pieces preserved by the neighbouring gentry escaping destruction a stone screen now surrounds the sacrarium on three sides the reredos is higher than this screen it is arcaded and its compartments have triangularheaded canopies and some wellexecuted figures the late mr street designed it and its cost was 1790 the bishops throne of english and foreign oak was also designed by the late mr street the canopy of the throne is nearly thirty feet high the pulpit is a memorial of archdeacon paley who is buried close at hand in the north choir aisle it is of richlycarved caen stone on a plinth of black manx marble and ornamented with carvings in white alabaster of scenes from the new testament in shape it is hexagonal with shafts at the angles rising into an enriched cornice the lecterna brass eaglewas given in memory of the late gc mounsey sometime diocesan registrar in the middle of the choir is a monument to bishop bell on a blue slab under a triple canopy the

robert bruce took an oath of fidelity to edward i ten years later he proved false to this oath and the papal legate solemnly excommunicated him with bell book and candle very shortly after this edward i dedicated the litter in which he had journeyed thus far and mounting his horse at the cathedral door rode through the priory gateway bent on the conquest of scotland he never lived to reach that country for he died in sight of the scottish coast at burghonsands north choir aislethis aisle is entered by a handsome decorated arch a very good example of thirteenthcentury work the north wall with the exquisite twolight lancet windows is early english and dates from the period immediately after the demolition of the norman choir about 1260 each compartment of the cinquefoil wallarcade is separated by triple columns and the space divided into four parts by shafts barely detached from the wall supporting foliated arches this is the general description for both north and south choir aisles the eastern bay belongs to the retrochoir and is of later date above the wallarcade are the graceful twolight lancet windows with their slender columns deep mouldings and rich dogtooth decoration in each bay there are four divisions the two outer ones blank and the two others forming the window the shafts are detached from the wall the central one is higher than the rest and its capital is foliated from the outer columns in the blank divisions the shoulder or hipped rib after rising a short distance sinks to the level of the capitals of the vaulting columns at the side of the window columns two small circular mouldings decorated with small dogtooth ornament continue without a break round the head of each window a large blank quatrefoil is inserted in the space between the lights and the outer arch moulding illustration north aisle of the choir from billings the corner column north side of entrance has been inserted by cutting away part of the east wall of the north transept like the aisle it dates from about the last half of the thirteenth century on its capital there is the spring of a pointed arch enriched with dogtooth ornament similar to the entrance arch probably it was intended to pull the north transept down and rebuild it with the addition of an eastern aisle this column would then have been part of it the existence of an offset on the north face of the aisle wall with the return of the basecourse and stringcourse upon it seems to add weight to this theory the nearest clustered column to it has also been altered and consists of five shafts instead of three a rib springs from the additional shafts to the centre of the corner column there are also remains of groining like that of the aisle the bay near the entrance has a window perpendicular dating from after the civil wars beneath this there was formerly an entrance to the cathedral this has now been walled up the groined stone roof dates from after 1292 although perhaps it is composed of materials of an earlier date on the south side of the entrance is a very beautiful foliated bracket the foliated boss at its base was at one time ornamented with a very fine knot monuments in north choir aislesin the third bay from the east are two lowarched recesses being of the same date as the aisle they may have been intended to receive the statues of the bishops who did their best to repair the ravages of the fire in 1292 the arches are almost flat and decorated with a kind of chevron moulding very rarely met with in burpham church sussex there is another example of this moulding applied to the decoration of the south side of the south transept arch a bishops effigy is in the eastern recess it is of early english date and before 1292 was situated within the choir afterwards a niche was cut in the fourth bay from the east for its reception it was eventually placed in its present position at the time of the restoration of the cathedral and the other niche filled up it may possibly represent bishop silvester of everdon it has suffered damage during its migrations in the cathedral and the feet are broken this was probably done when it was removed from the choir

and whose body was enshrined at durham where bell had been prior before his elevation to the bishopric the following is a detailed account of the legendary paintings with short note of the principal persons therein represented st cuthbert was born in the lothians at eight years he was living under the care of a widow in the village of wrangholm in 651 while keeping watch over his masters flocks near the lauder which flows into the tweed he had a vision of the soul of bishop aidan being carried up to heaven by angels a few days after he heard of the death of the good bishop and straightway journeyed to the monastery of melrose here he was accepted and in a short time received the tonsure the northumbrian peasants at this time were mostly only christians in name cuthbert wandered among them choosing the most outoftheway villages where other teachers would not go he needed no interpreter as he passed from village to village the frugal longheaded northumbrians listened willingly to one who was himself a peasant of the lowlands and who had caught the rough northumbrian burr his patience his humorous good sense the sweetness of his look told for him and not less the vigorous frame which fitted the peasantpreacher for the hard life he had chosen never did man die of hunger who served god faithfully he would say when nightfall found them supperless in the waste look at the eagle overhead god can feed us through him if he willand once at least he owed his meal to a fish that the scared bird let fall in 664 he was made prior of lindisfarne gentle with others he was severe with himself and was unsparing in his acts of mortification and devotion in 676 he retired first to a cave near howburn and later to fame island where he remained in strict seclusion for nine years he was elected bishop of hexham in 684 and with much difficulty was persuaded to undertake the duties he soon exchanged hexham for lindisfarne as bishop cuthbert was diligent in preaching protected the poor from their oppressors lived on very little and fed and clothed the poor towards the end of 686 he gave up his bishopric and returned to his beloved fame island where he died in march 687 st cuthbert 1

useful as a watchtower especially when the enemy was approaching from scotland the small turret was used for fire signals there is an interesting record in connection with the tower which is found in an account of the trial of the governor of carlisle in 1745 it is as follows i desired that two men might be posted upon the high tower of the cathedral with a very large spying glass i had brought with me and to send me a report of what they observed in the country the chancellor proposed to the clergy to take this duty which they readily did and were very exact and vigilant and when the

monastic buildings the monastic buildings were erected on the land south of the cathedral the cloisters enclosing a large open court stood west of the south transept communicating with the two doorsone in the northeast angle the other in the northwest the dormitory built upon an arcade was joined to the south transept and had a door opening into it above the present modern doorway west of the dormitory and parallel with the nave was the fratry adjoining the east end of which and stretching to the southeast were the domestic offices west of the fratry was the priors lodging now the deanery the chapterhouse which was built somewhere in the angle formed by the choir and the dormitory has disappeared entirely it was octagonal in shape about 28 feet across and had a conical roof the great fire in 1292 caused great destruction to the priory buildings they were put up again about 1350 and prior gondibur almost entirely rebuilt them towards the end of the fifteenth century there is no reason for doubting that the various buildings were handed over in good order at the dissolution of the priory the destruction which has left standing only the fratry the priors lodging and the gate tower 1528 was the act of the parliamentary troops and their scottish allies in 1645 when in addition to pulling down part of the nave they destroyed most of the monastic buildings in order to

883 chesterlestreet was chosen as the seat of the bishopric on account of the northmens raids on lindisfarne and in 995 the see was finally removed to durham carlisle thus formed part of the bishopric of durham until the death of flambard in 1128 this bishop had greatly displeased henry i and in order to curb the power of the bishops of durham he reduced the size of the diocese carlisle owing to its distance from durham and because of the laxity of ecclesiastical supervision in the surrounding district was chosen as the seat of a new bishopric and with about half of the present counties of westmoreland and cumberland made independent of durham a further reason for the choice of carlisle may have been the presence of the priory church begun by walter and finished by henry i william rufus in his lifetime had definitely made the district of carlisle part of the kingdom of england and henry gave the special care of this last won possession of the english crown to a prelate whose name of thelwulf is sure proof of his english birth thelwulf the kings own confessor and prior of carlisle was accordingly consecrated bishop in 1133 more than 400 years later at the reformation the priory was dissolved 1547 and the cathedral rededicated to the holy and undivided trinity in 1856 on the death of bishop percy a large part of westmoreland was transferred to carlisle and the diocese now

visit to david king of scotland in 1148 he died in 1155 bernard 1203 archbishop of ragusa for more than thirty years there was no appointment made to the see perhaps because the bishops revenues were

were hindering mauclerk and proceeding to the king at hereford renewed the sentence in which he was supported by all the bishops there present this had the effect of gaining permission for the release of mauclerk and leave to go to flanders in 1234 the bishop was restored to favour he resigned the bishopric in 1246 and became a dominican friar at oxford when this order of friars first came into england he had stood their friend presenting them with land and mills he died in 1248 sylvester de everdon 12471255 archdeacon of chester lord high chancellor sylvester was among the bishops who

the northwest angle rising abruptly about sixty feet above the river eden an area of nearly three acres has been enclosed with walls the longest side from northwest to southeast being about 256 yards long the west side 143 yards and the south side 200 yards two sides are very steep and the south side which slopes gradually to the town is defended outside the wall by a wide moat 10 feet deep there are two divisions the outer ward and the inner ward william rufus erected the keep which was at first the only building on the site and this was enclosed by a wall on the north and east a triangular ward was thus formed having its entrance at the southeast carlisle was fortified in 1170 and the city walls were carried up to the castle at this time the first entrance was blocked up and the present one made the outer ward was also enclosed the south wall with its flat buttresses is partly norman and partly thirteenthcentury work and this description generally applies to the north and west walls about 50 yards from the southwest angle and on the city walls is king richards tower a building of two storeys where richard iii is said to have lived when at carlisle it is also called the tile tower because of the thin bricks with which it was built a subterranean passage leading to the keep was discovered here early this century entrance to the castle is gained by a bridge crossing the moat this has replaced the old drawbridge and leads to a gatehouse with battlements a kind of barbican of two storeys the passage is vaulted and has massive doors of oak studded with iron formerly there was also a portcullis this leads to the outer ward which is about four times as large as the inner ward it is nearly square and contains modern buildings for the use of the garrison the two wards are divided by a strong stone wall 90 yards in length a wide ditch now filled up once ran in front in the centre of this wall is a buildingthe captains towerwhich gives access to the inner ward through its gateway secured at each end with a strong door some of the masonry of the captains tower is norman but it is mostly decorated a halfmoon battery of three guns once defended the tower and commanded the outer ward but it has now been removed illustration plan of the castle time of queen elizabeth the inner ward contains the great square keep 66 feet by 61 where the governor had his apartments and which was the final resort of the garrison when the place was entered by an enemy the walls are 15 feet in thickness except on the east side which is only 8 feet thick the building consists of a basement and three upper floors the highest floor is vaulted to sustain a platform for artillery the present height is 68 feet on a clear day a fine view can be had from the top embracing the mountains in the lake district the heights of northumberland the solway firth and the scottish coast several cells have been contrived in the eastern wall in one of which major mcdonald fergus mcivor is said to have been lodged some of the cell walls have been carved at various times with figures of men birds and animals these were perhaps executed with a nail in the north wall is the shaft of a well 78 feet deep this is supposed to be the well which was shown to st cuthbert when he visited carlisle the dungeons are in the ground floor and of course are distinguished by a plentiful lack of daylight and fresh air illustration the castle a pumphrey photo queen marys tower so called from having been the prison of mary queen of scots was in the southeast angle of the inner ward it was pulled down in 1835 and a wall built round the angle it was in part norman work of the time of william rufus and partly early english and had a large rounded archway springing from capitals with zigzag decoration there was also a portcullis for its defence a passage used by queen mary to pass out to the ladys walk which ran eastward from the gatehouse has been walled up the long hall a fine structure about 100 feet by 40 in which the parliament of 13067 met was also situated in this ward but was demolished with several other buildings 18241835 at various times the castle has undergone extensive repairs notably in the reigns of richard iii edward iii henry viii and elizabeth during the siege in 16445 it suffered much damage and was patched up by the parliamentary troops a hundred years later the duke of cumberland thought very little of its powers of defence for he contemptuously called it an old hencoop among the governors several wellknown men figure for instance andrew harcla the duke of gloucester afterwards richard iii and hotspur upon the death of lieutenantgeneral ramsay in 1837 the office of governor was abolished the castle now furnishes barrack accommodation
