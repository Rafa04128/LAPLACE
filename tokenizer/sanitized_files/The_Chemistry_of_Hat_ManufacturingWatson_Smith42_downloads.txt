little book is the substance of a series of lectures delivered before the hat manufacturers association in the years 1887 and 1888 about this period owing to the increasing difficulties of competition with the products of the german hat manufacturers a deputation of hat manufacturers in and around manchester consulted sir henry e roscoe frs then the professor of chemistry in the owens college manchester and he advised the formation of an association and the appointment of a lecturer who was to make a practical investigation of the art of hat manufacturing and then to deliver a series of lectures on the applications of science to this industry sir henry roscoe recommended the writer then the lecturer on chemical technology in the owens college as lecturer and he was accordingly appointed the lectures were delivered with copious experimental illustrations through two sessions and during the course a patent by one of the younger members became due which proved to contain the solution of the chief difficulty of the british felthat manufacturer see pages 6668 this remarkable coincidence served to give especial stress to the wisdom of the counsel of sir henry roscoe whose response to the appeal of the members of the deputation of 1887 was at once to point them to scientific light and training as their only resource in a letter recently received from sir henry 1906 he writes i agree with you that this is a good instance of the direct money value of scientific training and in these days of protection and similar subterfuges it is not amiss to emphasise the fact it is thus gratifying to the writer to think that the lectures have had some influence on the remarkable progress which the british hat industry has made in the twenty years that have elapsed since their delivery these lectures were in part printed and published in the hatters gazette and in part in newspapers of manchester and stockport and they have here been compiled and edited and the necessary illustrations added etc by mr albert shonk to whom i would express my best thanks watson smith london april 1906 contents lecture page i textile fibres principally wool fur and hair 1 ii textile

and hair vegetable fibrestextile fibres may be broadly distinguished as vegetable and animal fibres it is absolutely necessary in order to obtain a useful knowledge of the peculiarities and properties of animal fibres generally or even specially that we should be at least to some extent familiar with those of the vegetable fibres i shall therefore have in the first place something to tell you of certain principal vegetable fibres before we commence the more special study of the animal fibres most interesting to you as hat manufacturers namely wool fur and hair what cotton is as a vegetable product i shall not in detail describe but i will refer you to the interesting and complete work of dr bowman on the structure of the cotton fibre suffice it to say that in certain plants and trees the seeds or fruit are surrounded in the pods in which they develop with a downy substance and that the cotton shrub belongs to this class of plants a fibre picked out from the mass of the downy substance referred to and examined under the microscope is found to be a spirally twisted band or better an irregular more or less flattened and twisted tube see fig 1 we know it is a tube because on taking a thin narrow slice across a fibre and examining the slice under the microscope we can see the hole or perforation up the centre forming the axis of the tube see fig 2 mr h de mosenthal in an extremely interesting and valuable paper see jsci1 1904 vol xxiii p 292 has recently shown that the cuticle of the cotton fibre is extremely porous having in addition to pores what appear to be minute stomata the latter being frequently arranged in oblique rows as if they led into oblique lateral channels a cotton fibre varies from 25 to 6 centimetres in length and in breadth from 0017 to 005 millimetre the characteristics mentioned make it very easy to distinguish cotton from other vegetable or animal fibres for example another vegetable fibre is flax or linen and this has a very different appearance under the microscope see fig 3 it has a bamboolike or jointed appearance its tubes are not flattened nor are they twisted flax belongs to a class called the bast fibres a name given to certain fibres obtained from the inner bark of different plants jute also is a bast fibre the finer qualities of it look like flax but as we shall see it is not chemically identical with cotton as linen or flax is another vegetable fibre termed cottonsilk from its beautiful lustrous silky appearance has excited some attention because it grows freely in the german colony called the camaroons and also on the gold coast this fibre under the microscope differs entirely in appearance from both cotton and flax fibres its fibres resemble straight and thin smooth transparent almost glassy tubes with large axial bores in fact if wetted in water you can see the water and air bubbles in the tubes under the microscope a more detailed account of cottonsilk appears in a paper read by me before the society of chemical industry in 1886 see jsci 1886 vol v p 642 now the substance of the cotton linen or flax as well as that of the cottonsilk fibres is termed chemically cellulose raw cotton consists of cellulose with about 5 per cent of impurities this cellulose is a chemical compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and according to the relative proportions of these constituents it has had the chemical formula c6h10o5 assigned to it each letter stands for an atom of each constituent named and the numerals tell us the number of the constituent atoms in the whole compound atom of cellulose this cellulose is closely allied in composition to starch dextrin and a form of sugar called glucose it is possible to convert cotton rags into this form of sugarglucoseby treating first with strong vitriol or sulphuric acid and then boiling with dilute acid for a long time before we leave these vegetable or cellulose fibres i will give you a means of testing them so as to enable you to distinguish them broadly from the animal fibres amongst which are silk wool fur and hair a good general test to distinguish a vegetable and an animal fibre is the following which is known as molischs test to a very small quantity about 001 gram of the wellwashed cotton fibre 1 cc of water is added then two to three drops of a 15 to 20 per cent solution of alphanaphthol in alcohol and finally an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid on agitating a deep violet colour is developed by using thymol in place of the alphanaphthol a red or scarlet colour is produced if the fibre were one of an animal nature merely a yellow or greenishyellow coloured solution would result i told you however that jute is not chemically identical with cotton and linen the substance of its fibre has been termed bastose by cross and bevan who have investigated it it is not identical with ordinary cellulose for if we take a little of the jute soak it in dilute acid then in chloride of lime or hypochlorite of soda and finally pass it through a bath of sulphite of soda a beautiful crimson colour develops upon it not developed in the case of cellulose cotton linen etc it is certain that it is a kind of cellulose but still not identical with true cellulose all animal fibres when burnt emit a peculiar empyreumatic odour resembling that from burnt feathers an odour which no vegetable fibre under like circumstances emits hence a good test is to burn a piece of the fibre in a lamp flame and notice the odour all vegetable fibres are easily tendered or rendered rotten by the action of even dilute mineral acids with the additional action of steam the effect is much more rapid as also if the fibre is allowed to dry with the acid upon or in it animal fibres are not nearly so sensitive under these conditions but whereas caustic alkalis have not much effect on vegetable fibres if kept out of contact with the air the animal fibres are very quickly attacked superheated steam alone has but little effect on cotton or vegetable fibres but it would fuse or melt wool based on these differences methods have been devised and patented for treating mixed woollen and cotton tissues1 with hydrochloric acid gas or moistening with dilute hydrochloric acid and steaming to remove all the cotton fibre or 2 with a jet of superheated steam under a pressure of 5 atmospheres 75 lb per square inch when the woollen fibre is simply melted out of the tissue and sinks to the bottom of the vessel a vegetable tissue remaining heddebault if we write on paper with dilute sulphuric acid and dry and then heat the place written upon the cellulose is destroyed and charred and we get black writing produced the principle involved is the same as in the separation of cotton from mixed woollen and cotton goods by means of sulphuric acid or vitriol the fabric containing cotton or let us say cellulose particles is treated with dilute vitriol pressed or squeezed and then roughly dried that cellulose then becomes mere dust and is simply beaten out of the intact woollen texture the cellulose is in a pure state a white powder of specific gravity 15 ie one and a half times as heavy as water and is quite insoluble in such solvents as water alcohol ether but it does dissolve in a solution of hydrated oxide of copper in ammonia on adding acids to the cupricammonium solution the cellulose is reprecipitated in the form of a gelatinous mass cotton and linen are scarcely dissolved at all by a solution of basic zinc chloride footnote 1 jsci journal of the society of chemical industry illustration fig 1 illustration fig 2 illustration fig 3 illustration fig 4 silkwe now pass on to the animal fibres and of these we must first consider silk this is one of the most perfect substances for use in the textile arts a silk fibre may be considered as a kind of rod of solidified flexible gum secreted in and exuded from glands placed on the side of the body of the silkworm in fig 4 are shown the forms of the silk fibre in which there are no central cavities or axial bores as in cotton and flax and no signs of any cellular structure or external markings but a comparatively smooth glassy surface there is however a longitudinal groove of more or less depth the fibre is semitransparent the beautiful pearly lustre being due to the smoothness of the outer layer and its reflection of the light in the silk fibre there are two distinct parts first the central portion or as we may regard it the true fibre chemically termed fibron and secondly an envelope composed of a substance or substances chemically termed sericin and often silkglue or silkgum both the latter and fibron are composed of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen here there is thus one element more than in the vegetable fibres previously referred to namely nitrogen and this nitrogen is contained in all the animal fibres the outer envelope of silkglue or sericin can be dissolved off the inner fibron fibre by means of hot water or warm water with a little soap warm dilute that is weak acids such as sulphuric acid etc also dissolve this silkglue and can be used like soap solutions for ungumming silk dilute nitric acid only slightly attacks silk and colours it yellow it would not so colour vegetable fibres and this forms a good test to distinguish silk from a vegetable fibre cold strong acetic acid socalled glacial acetic acid removes the yellowish colouring matter from raw silk without dissolving the sericin or silkgum by heating under pressure with acetic acid however silk is completely dissolved silk is also dissolved by strong sulphuric acid forming a brown thick liquid if we add water to this thick liquid a clear solution is obtained and then on adding tannic acid the fibron is precipitated strong caustic potash or soda dissolves silk more easily if warm dilute caustic alkalis if sufficiently dilute will dissolve off the sericin and leave the inner fibre of fibron but they are not so good for ungumming silk as soap solutions are as the fibre after treatment with them is deficient in whiteness and brilliancy silk dissolves completely in hot basic zinc chloride solution and also in an alkaline solution of copper and glycerin which solutions do not dissolve vegetable fibres or wool chlorine and bleachingpowder solutions soon attack and destroy silk and so another and milder agent namely sulphurous acid is used to bleach this fibre silk is easily dyed by the aniline and coaltar colours and with beautiful effect but it has little attraction for the mineral colours woolnext to silk as an animal fibre we come to wool and different varieties of fur and hair covering certain classes of animals such as sheep goats rabbits and hares generally and without going at all deeply into the subject we may say that wool differs from fur and hair of which we may regard it as a variety by being usually more elastic flexible and curly and because it possesses certain features of surface structure which confer upon it the property of being more easily matted together than fur and hair are we must first shortly consider the manner of growth of hair without spending too much time on this part of the subject the accompanying figure see fig 5 shows a section of the skin with a hair or wool fibre rooted in it here we may see that the ground work if we may so term it is fourfold in structure proceeding downwards we havefirst the outer skin scarfskin or cuticle second a second layer or skin called the rete mucosum forming the epidermis third papillary layer fourth the corium layer forming the dermis the peculiar globular cellular masses below in the corium are called adipose cells and these throw off perspiration or moisture which is carried away to the surface by the glands shown called sudoriparous glands which as is seen pass independently off to the surface other glands terminate under the skin in the hair follicles which follicles or hair sockets contain or enclose the hair roots these glands terminating in the hair follicles secrete an oily substance which bathes and lubricates as well as nourishes the hair with respect to the origin of the hair or wool fibre this is formed inside the follicle by the exuding therefrom of a plastic liquid or lymph this latter gradually becomes granular and is then formed into cells which as the growth proceeds are elongated into fibres which form the central portion of the hair just as with the trunk of a tree we have an outer dense portion the bark an inner less dense and more cellular layer and an inmost portion which is most cellular and porous so with a hair the central portion is loose and porous the outer more and more dense on glancing at the figure fig 6 of the longitudinal section of a human hair we see first the outer portion like the bark of a tree consisting of a dense sheath of flattened scales then comes an inner lining of closelypacked fibrous cells and frequently an inner wellmarked central bundle of larger and rounder cells forming a medullary axis the transverse section fig 7 shows this exceedingly well the end of a hair is generally pointed sometimes filamentous the lower extremity is larger than the shaft and terminates in a conical bulb or mass of cells which forms the root of the hair in the next figure fig 8 we are supposed to have separated these cells and above a we see some of the cells from the central pith or medulla and fat globules between b some of the intermediate elongated or angular cells and below c two flattened compressed structureless and horny scales from the outer portion of the hair now these latter flattened scales are of great importance their character and mode of connection with the stratum or cortical substance below not only make all the difference between wool and hair but also determine the extent and degree of that peculiar property of interlocking of the hairs known as felting let us now again look at a human hair the light was reflected from this hair as it lay under the microscope and now we see the reason of the sawlike edge in the longitudinal section for just as the tiles lie on the roof of a house or the scales on the back of a fish so the whole surface of the hair is externally coated with a firmly adhering layer of flat overlying scales with not very even upper edges as you see the upper or free edges of these scales are all directed towards the end of the hair and away from the root but when you look at a hair in its natural state you cannot see these scales so flat do they lie on the hairshaft what you see are only irregular transverse lines across it now i come to a matter of great importance as will later on appear in connection with means for promoting felting properties if a hair such as described with the scales lying flat on the shaft be treated with certain substances or reagents which act upon and dissolve or decompose or disintegrate its parts then the free edges of these scales rise up they set their backs up so to say they in fact stand off like the scales of a fircone and at length act like the fircone in ripening at last becoming entirely loose as regards wool and fur these scales are of the utmost importance for very marked differences exist even in the wool of a single sheep or the fur of a single hare it is the duty of the woolsorter to distinguish and separate the various qualities in each fleece and of the furrier to do the same in the case of each fur in short upon the nature and arrangement and conformation of the scales on the hairshafts especially as regards those free upper edges depends the distinction of the value of many classes of wool and fur these scales vary both as to nature and arrangement in the case of the hairs of different animals so that by the aid of the microscope we have often a means of determining from what kind of animal the hair has been derived it is on the nature of this outside scaly covering of the shaft and in the manner of attachment of these scaly plates that the true distinction between wool and hair rests the principal epidermal characteristic of a true wool is the capacity of its fibres to felt or mat together this arises from the greater looseness of the scaly covering of the hair so that when opposing hairs come into contact the scales interlock see fig 9 and thus the fibres are held together just as with hair the scales of which have their free edges pointing upwards away from the root and towards the extremity of the hair so with wool when the wool is on the back of the sheep the scales of the woolly hair all point in the same direction so that while maintained in that attitude the individual hairs slide over one another and do not tend to felt or mat if they did woe betide the animal the fact of the peculiar serrated scaly structure of hair and wool is easily proved by working a hair between the fingers if for instance a human hair be placed between finger and thumb and gently rubbed by the alternate motion of finger and thumb together it will then invariably move in the direction of the root quite independently of the will of the person performing the test a glance at the form of the typical wool fibres shown see fig 10 will show the considerable difference between a wool and a hair fibre you will observe that the scales of the wool fibre are rather pointed than rounded at their free edges and that at intervals we have a kind of composite and jaggededged funnels fitting into each other and thus making up the covering of the cylindrical portion of the fibre the sharpened jagged edges enable these scales more easily to get under the opposing scales and to penetrate inwards and downwards according to the pressure exerted the free edges of the scales of wool are much longer and deeper than in the case of hair in hair the overlapping scales are attached to the under layer up to the edges of those scales and at this extremity can only be detached by the use of certain reagents but this is not so with wool for here the ends of the scales are for nearly twothirds of their length free and are moreover partially turned outwards one of the fibres shown in fig 10 is that of the merino sheep and is one of the most valuable and beautiful wools grown there you have the type of a fibre best suited for textile purposes and the more closely different hairs approach this the more suitable and valuable they become for those purposes and vice vers with regard to the curly structure of wool which increases the matting tendency though the true cause of this curl is not known there appears to be a close relationship between the tendency to curl the fineness of the fibre and the number of scales per linear inch upon the surface with regard to hair and fur i have already shown that serrated fibres are not specially peculiar to sheep but are much more widely diffused most of the higher members of the mammalia family possess a hairy covering of some sort and in by far the larger number is found a tendency to produce an undergrowth of fine woolly fibre especially in the winter time the differences of human hair and hairs generally from the higher to the lower forms of mammalia consist only in variations of size and arrangement as regards the cells composing the different parts of the fibre as well as in a greater or less development of the scales on the covering or external hair surface thus under the microscope the wool and hairs of various animals as also even hairs from different parts of the same animal show a great variety of structure development and appearance illustration fig 5 illustration fig 6 illustration fig 7 illustration fig 8 illustration fig 9 illustration finest merino wool fibre typical wool fibre fibre of wool from chinese sheep fig 10 illustration fig 11 illustration fig 12 we have already observed that hair if needed for felting is all the betterprovided of course no injury is done to the fibre itselffor some treatment by which the scales otherwise lying flatter on the hairshafts than in the case of the hairs of wool are made to stand up somewhat extending outwards their free edges this brings me to the consideration of a practice pursued by furriers for this purpose and known as the scretage or carrotting process it consists in a treatment with a solution of mercuric nitrate in nitric acid in order to improve the felting qualities of the fur this acid mixture is brushed on to the fur which is cut from the skin by a suitable sharp cutting or shearing machine a manchester furrier who gave me specimens of some fur untreated by the process and also some of the same fur that had been treated informed me that others of his line of business use more mercury than he does ie leave less free nitric acid in their mixture but he prefers his own method and thinks it answers best for the promotion of felting the treated fur he gave me was turned yellow with the nitric acid in parts brown and here and there the hairs were slightly matted with the acid in my opinion the fur must suffer from such unequal treatment with such strong acid and in the final process of finishing i should not be surprised if difficulty were found in getting a high degree of lustre and finish upon hairs thus roughened or partially disintegrated figs 11 and 12 respectively illustrate fur fibres from different parts of the same hare before and after the treatment in examining one of these fibres from the side of a hare you see what the cause of this roughness is and what is also the cause of the difficulty in giving a polish or finish the free edges are partially disintegrated etched as it were besides being caused to stand out a weaker acid ought to be used or more mercury and less acid as we shall afterwards see another dangerous agent if not carefully used is bichrome bichromate of potassium which is also liable to roughen and injure the fibre and thus interfere with the final production of a good finish lecture ii textile fibres principally wool fur and haircontinued with regard to the preparation of fur by acid mixtures for felting mentioned in the last lecture i will tell you what i think i should recommend in all wool and fur there is a certain amount of grease and this may vary in different parts of the material where there is most however the acid nitric acid or nitric acid solution of nitrate of mercury will wet and so act on the fur least but the action ought to be uniform and i feel sure it cannot be until the grease is removed i should therefore first wash the felts on the fur side with a weak alkaline solution one of carbonate of soda free from any caustic to remove all grease then with water to remove alkali and my belief is that a weaker and less acid solution of nitric acid and nitrate of mercury and a smaller quantity of it would then do the work required and do it more uniformly a question frequently asked is why will dead wool not felt answer if the animal become weak and diseased the wool suffers degradation also with improvement in health follows pari passu improvement in the wool structure which means increase both in number and vigour of the scales on the wool fibres increase of the serrated ends of these and of their regularity in weakness and disease the number of scales in a given hairshaft diminishes and these become finer and less pronounced the fibres themselves also become attenuated hence when disease becomes death we have considerably degraded fibres this is seen clearly in the subjoined figures see fig 13 which are of wool fibres from animals that have died of disease the fibres are attenuated and irregular the scale markings and edges have almost disappeared in some places and are generally scanty and meagre in development it is no wonder that such dead wool will be badly adapted for felting dead wool is nearly as bad as kempy wool in which malformation of fibre has occurred in such kemps as dr bowman has shown scales have disappeared and the fibre has become in part or whole a dense noncellular structure resisting dyepenetration and felting see fig 14 illustration fig 13 illustration fig 14 one of the physical properties of wool is its hygroscopicity or power of absorbing moisture as the very structure of wool and fur fibre would lead us to suppose these substances are able to absorb a very considerable amount of water without appearing damp if exposed freely to the air in warm and dry weather wool retains from 8 to 10 per cent and if in a damp place for some time it may absorb as much as from 30 to 50 per cent of water wool fur or hair that has been washed absorbs the most moisture indeed the amount of water taken up varies inversely with the fatty or oily matter present hence the less fat the more moisture in the washed wool those fibres in which the cells are more loosely arranged have the greatest absorbing power for water no doubt the moisture finds its way in between the cells of the wool fibre from which the oil or fat has been removed but i need hardly remind you that if wool and fur are capable according to the circumstances under which they are placed of absorbing so much moisture as that indicated it becomes especially in times of pressure and competition very important to inquire if it be not worth while to cease paying wool and fur prices for mere water this question was answered long ago in the negative by our continental neighbours and in germany france and switzerland official conditioning establishments have been founded by the governments of those countries for the purpose of testing lots of purchased wool and silk etc for moisture in order that this moisture may be deducted from the invoices and cash paid for real dry wool etc i would point out that if you as hat manufacturers desire to enter the lists with germany you must not let her have any advantage you have not and it is an advantage to pay for what you know exactly the composition of rather than for an article that may contain 7 per cent or for aught you know 17 per cent or 30 per cent of water there is so far as i know no testing for water in wools and furs in this country and certainly no conditioning establishments 1887 and i suppose if a german or french wool merchant or furrier could be imagined as selling wool etc in part to a german or french firm and in part to an english one the latter would take the material without a murmur though it might contain 10 per cent or peradventure 30 per cent of water and no doubt the foreign just as the english merchant or dealer would get the best price he could and regard the possible 10 per cent or 30 per cent of water present with certainly the more equanimity the more of that very cheap element there were present but look at the other side the german or french firm samples its lot as delivered takes the sample to be tested and that 10 or 30 per cent of water is deducted and only the dry wool is paid for a few little mistakes of this kind i need hardly say will altogether form a kind of vade mecum for the foreign competitor we will now see what the effect of water is in the felting operation especially hot water assists that operation and the effect is a curious one when acid is added as well the felting is still further increased and shrinking also takes place as already shown you the free ends of the scales themselves softened by the warm dilute acid are extended and project more and stand out from the shafts of the hairs on the whole were i a hat manufacturer i should prefer to buy my fur untreated by that nitric acid and mercury process previously referred to and promote its felting properties myself by the less severe and more rational course of proceeding such for example as treatment with warm dilute acid we have referred to two enemies standing in the way to the obtainment of a final lustre and finish on felted wool or fur now let us expose a third in the black dyeing of the hatforms a boiling process is used let us hear what dr bowman in his work on the wool fibre says with regard to boiling with water wool which looked quite bright when well washed with tepid water was decidedly duller when kept for some time in water at a temperature of 160 f and the same wool when subjected to boiling water at 212 f became quite dull and lustreless when tested for strength the same fibres which carried on the average 500 grains without breaking before boiling after boiling would not bear more than 480 grains hence this third enemy is a boiling process especially a longcontinued one if only with water itself if we could use coaltar colours and dye in only a warm weak acid bath not boil we could get better lustre and finish we will now turn our attention to the chemical composition of wool and fur fibres on chemical analysis still another element is found over and above those mentioned as the constituents of silk fibre in silk you will recollect we observed the presence of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen in wool fur etc we must add a fifth constituent namely sulphur here is an analysis of pure german woolcarbon 4925 per cent hydrogen 757 oxygen 2366 nitrogen 1586 sulphur 366total 10000 if you heat either wool fur or hair to 130 c it begins to decompose and to give off ammonia if still further heated to from 140 to 150 c vapours containing sulphur are evolved if some wool be placed in a dry glass tube and heated strongly so as to cause destructive distillation products containing much carbonate of ammonium are given off the ammonia is easily detected by its smell of hartshorn and the blue colour produced on a piece of reddened litmus paper the latter being a general test to distinguish alkalis like ammonia soda and potash from acids no vegetable fibres will under any circumstances give off ammonia it may be asked but what does the production of ammonia prove i reply the backbone chemically speaking of ammonia is nitrogen ammonia is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen and is formulated nh3 and hence to discover ammonia in the products as mentioned is to prove the prior existence of its nitrogen in the wool fur and hair fibres action of acids on wool etcdilute solutions of vitriol sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid muriatic acid spirits of salt have little effect on wool whether warm or cold except to open out the scales and confer roughness on the fibre used in the concentrated state however the wool or fur would soon be disintegrated and ruined but under all circumstances the action is far less than on cotton which is destroyed at once and completely nitric acid acts like sulphuric and hydrochloric acids but it gives a yellow colour to the fibre you see this clearly enough in the fur that comes from your furriers after the treatment they subject it to with nitric acid and nitrate of mercury there is a process known called the stripping of wool and it consists in destroying the colour of wool and woollen goods already dyed in order that they may be redyed listen however to the important precautions followed a nitric acid not stronger than from 3 to 4 twaddell is used and care is taken not to prolong the action more than three or four minutes action of alkalisalkalis have a very considerable action on fur and wool but the effects vary a good deal according to the kind of alkali used the strength and the temperature of the solution as also of course the length of period of contact the caustic alkalis potash and soda under all conditions affect wool and fur injuriously in fact we have a method of recovering indigo from indigodyed woollen rags based on the solubility of the wool in hot caustic soda the wool dissolves and the indigo being insoluble remains and can be recovered alkaline carbonates and soap in solution have little or no injurious action if not too strong and if the temperature be not over 50 c 106 f soap and carbonate of ammonium have the least injurious action every washer or scourer of wool when he uses soaps should first ascertain if they are free from excess of alkali ie that they contain no free alkali and when he uses soda ash sodium carbonate that it contains no caustic alkali lime in water or otherwise acts injuriously rendering the fibre brittle reactions and tests proving chemical differences and illustrating modes of discriminating and separating vegetable fibres silk and wool fur etcyou will remember i stated that the vegetable fibre differs chemically from those of silk and silk from wool fur and hair in that with the first we have as constituents only carbon hydrogen and oxygen in silk we have carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen whilst in wool fur and hair we have carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen and sulphur i have already shown you that if we can liberate by any means ammonia from a substance we have practically proved the presence of nitrogen in that substance for ammonia is a nitrogen compound as regards sulphur and its compounds that illsmelling gas sulphuretted hydrogen which occurs in rotten eggs in organic effluvia from cesspools and the like and which in the case of bad eggs and to some extent with good eggs turns the silver spoons black and in the case of white lead paints turns these brown or black i can show you some still more convincing proofs that sulphur is contained in wool fur and hair and not in silk nor in vegetable fibres first i will heat strongly some cotton with a little sodalime in a tube and hold a piece of moistened red litmus paper over the mouth of the tube if nitrogen is present it will take up hydrogen in the decomposition ensuing and escape as ammonia which will turn the red litmus paper blue with the cotton however no ammonia escapes no turning of the piece of red litmus paper blue is observed and so no nitrogen can be present in the cotton fibre secondly i will similarly treat some silk ammonia escapes turns the red litmus paper blue possesses the smell like hartshorn and produces with hydrochloric acid on the stopper of a bottle dense white fumes of salammoniac ammonium chloride hence silk contains nitrogen thirdly i will heat some fur with sodalime ammonia escapes giving all the reactions described under silk hence fur wool etc contain nitrogen as regards proofs of all three of these classes of fibres containing carbon hydrogen and oxygen the char they all leave behind on heating in a closed vessel is the carbon itself present for the hydrogen and oxygen a perfectly dry sample of any of these fabrics is taken of course in quantity and heated strongly in a closed vessel furnished with a condensing worm like a still you will find all give you water as a condensatethe vegetable fibre acid water the animal fibres alkaline water from the ammonia the presence of water proves both hydrogen and oxygen since water is a compound of these elements if you put a piece of potassium in contact with the water the latter will at once decompose the potassium absorbing the oxygen and setting free the hydrogen as gas which you could collect and ignite with a match when you would find it would burn that hydrogen was the hydrogen forming part of your cotton silk or wool as the case might be we must now attack the question of sulphur first we prepare a little alkaline lead solution sodium plumbate by adding caustic soda to a solution of lead acetate or sugar of lead until the white precipitate first formed is just dissolved that is one of our reagents the other is a solution of a redcoloured salt called nitroprusside of sodium made by the action of nitric acid on sodium ferrocyanide yellow prussiate the firstnamed is very sensitive to sulphur and turns black directly to show this we take a quantity of flowers of sulphur dissolve in caustic soda and add to the lead solution it turns black at once because the sulphur unites with the lead to form black sulphide of lead the nitroprusside however gives a beautiful crimsonpurple coloration now on taking a little cotton and heating with the caustic alkaline lead solution if sulphur were present in that cotton the fibre would turn black or brown for the lead would at once absorb such sulphur and form in the fibre soaked with it black sulphide of lead no such coloration is formed so cotton does not contain sulphur secondly we must test silk silk contains nitrogen like wool but does it contain sulphur the answer furnished by our tests isno since the fibre is not coloured brown or black on heating with the alkaline lead solution thirdly we try some white berlin wool so that we can easily see the change of colour if it takes place in the hot lead solution the wool turns black lead sulphide being formed on adding the nitroprusside solution to a fresh portion of wool boiled with caustic soda to dissolve out the sulphur a splendid purple coloration is produced fur and hair would of course do the same thing lead solutions have been used for dyeing the hair black not caustic alkaline solutions like this however they would do something more than turn the hair blackprobably give rise to some vigorous exercise of muscular power still it has been found that even the lead solutions employed have through gradual absorption into the system whilst dyeing the hair black also caused colics and contractions of the limbs having now found means for proving the presence of the various elements composing cotton silk and wool fur or hair we come to methods that have been proposed for distinguishing these fibres more generally and for quantitatively determining them in mixtures one of the best of the reagents for this purpose is the basic zinc chloride already referred to this is made as follows 100 parts of fused zinc chloride 85 parts of water and 4 parts of zinc oxide are boiled together until a clear solution is obtained this solution dissolves silk slowly in the cold quickly if hot and forms a thick gummy liquid wool fur and vegetable fibres are not affected by it hence if we had a mixture and treated with this solution we could strain off the liquid containing the dissolved silk and would get cotton and wool left on weighing before and after such treatment the difference in weights would give us the silk present the residue boiled with caustic soda would lose all its wool which is soluble in hot strong caustic alkali again straining off we should get only the cotton or other vegetable fibre left and thus our problem would be solved of course there are certain additional niceties and modifications still needed and i must refer you for the method in full to the journal of the society of chemical industry 1882 page 64 also 1884 page 517 i will now conclude with some tests with alkaline and acid reagents taken in order and first the acids these will also impress upon our minds the effects of acids and alkalis on the different kinds of fibres i in three flasks three similar portions of cotton lampwick woollen yarn and silk are placed after previously moistening them in water and wringing them out to each is now added similar quantities of concentrated sulphuric acid the cotton is quickly broken up and dissolved especially if assisted by gentle warming and at last a brown probably a blackbrown solution is obtained the woollen is a little broken up but not much to the naked eye and the vitriol is not coloured the silk is at once dissolved even in the cold acid we now add excess of water to the contents of each flask a brownish though clear solution is produced in the case of cotton the woollen floats not much injured in the acid whilst a clear limpid solution is obtained with the silk on adding tannic acid solution to all three only the silk yields a precipitate a rather curdy one consisting of fibron ii three specimens of cotton wool and silk respectively are touched with nitric acid cotton is not coloured but wool and silk are stained yellow they are practically dyed iii three specimens of cotton wool and silk respectively are placed in three flasks and caustic soda solution of specific gravity 105 10 twaddell is added on boiling the wool and silk dissolve whilst the cellulose fibre cotton remains undestroyed iv if instead of caustic soda as in iii a solution of oxide of copper in ammonia be used cotton and silk are dissolved but wool remains unchanged ie undissolved if sugar or gum solutions be added to the solutions of cotton and silk the cotton cellulose is precipitated whilst the silk is not but remains in solution v another alkaline solvent for silk which however leaves undissolved cotton and wool is prepared as follows 16 grains of copper sulphate blue vitriol bluestone are dissolved in 150 cc of water and then 16 grains of glycerin are added to this mixture a solution of caustic soda is added until the precipitate first formed is just redissolved so as not to leave an excess of caustic soda present lecture iii water its chemistry and properties impurities and their action tests of purity i have already had occasion to refer in my last lecture to water as a chemical substance as a compound containing and consisting of hydrogen and oxygen what are these water constituents hydrogen and oxygen each of them is a gas but each a gas having totally different properties on decomposing water and collecting the one of these two gases the hydrogen gas in one vessel and the other the oxygen gas in another vessel twice as large a volume of hydrogen gas is given off by the decomposing water as of oxygen you may now notice a certain meaning in the formula assigned to water h2o two volumes of hydrogen combined with one of oxygen and it may be added that when such combination takes place not three volumes of resulting water vapour steam but two volumes are produced this combination of the two gases when mixed together is determined by heating to a high temperature or by passing an electric spark it then takes place with the consequent sudden condensation of three volumes of mixture to two of compound so as to cause an explosion i may also mention that as regards the weights of these bodies oxygen and hydrogen the first is sixteen times as heavy as the second and since we adopt hydrogen as the unit we may consider h to stand for hydrogen and also to signify 1the unit whilst o means oxygen and also 16 hence the compound atom or molecule of water h2o weighs 18 i must now show you that these two gases are possessed of totally different properties some gases will extinguish a flame some will cause the flame to burn brilliantly but will not burn themselves and some will take fire and burn themselves though extinguishing the flame which has ignited them we say the first are noncombustible and will not support combustion the second are supporters of combustion the third are combustible gases of course these are as the lawyers say only ex parte statements of the truth still they are usually accepted oxygen gas will ignite a redhot match but hydrogen will extinguish an inflamed one though it will itself burn you generally think of water as the great antithesis of the universal antidote for fire the truth is here again only of an ex parte character as i will show you if i can by means of a substance having a more intense affinity for oxygen than hydrogen has rob water of its oxygen i necessarily set the hydrogen that was combined with that oxygen free if the heat caused by the chemical struggle so to say is great that hydrogen will be inflamed and burn thus we are destroying that antithesis we are causing the water to yield us fire i will do this by putting potassium on water and even in the cold this potassium will seize upon the oxygen of the water and the hydrogen will take fire specific gravitywe must now hasten to other considerations of importance water is generally taken as the unit in specific gravities assigned to liquids and solids this simply means that when we desire to express how heavy a thing is we are compelled to say it is so many times heavier or lighter than something that something is generally water which is regarded consequently as unit or figure 1 a body of specific gravity 15 or 112 means that that body is 112 or 15 times as heavy as water as hat manufacturers you will have mostly to do with the specific gravities of liquids aqueous solutions and you will hear more of twaddell degrees the twaddell hydrometer or instrument for measuring the specific gravities of liquids is so constructed that when it stands in water the water is just level with its zero or 0 mark well since in your reading of methods and new processes you will often meet with specific gravity numbers and desire to convert these into twaddell degrees i will give you a simple means of doing this add cyphers so as to make into a number of four figures then strike out the unit and decimal point farthest to the left and divide the residue by 5 and you get the corresponding twaddell degrees if you have twaddell degrees simply multiply by 5 and add 1000 to the result and you get the specific gravity as usually taken with water as the unit or in this case as 1000 an instrument much used on the continent is the beaum hydrometer the degrees n indicated by this instrument can be converted into specific gravity d by the formula d 14431443 n ebullition or boiling of water steamthe atmosphere around us is composed of a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen gases not a compound of these gases as water is of hydrogen and oxygen but a mixture more like sand and water or smoke and air this mass of gases has weight and presses upon objects at the surface of the earth to the extent of 15 lb on the square inch now some liquids such as water were it not for this atmospheric pressure would not remain liquids at all but would become gases the pressure thus tends to squeeze gases together and convert them into liquids any force that causes gases to contract will do the same thing of coursefor example cold and ceteris paribus removal of pressure and expansion by heat will act so as to gasify liquids when in the expansion of liquids a certain stage or degree is reached different for different liquids gas begins to escape so quickly from the liquid that bubbles of vapour are continually formed and escape this is called ebullition or boiling a certain removal of pressure or expansion by heat is necessary to produce this ie to reach the boilingpoint of the liquid as regards the heat necessary for the boiling of water at the surface of the earth ie under the atmospheric pressure of 15 lb on the square inch this is shown on the thermometer of fahrenheit as 212 and on the simpler centigrade one as 100 water freezing at 0 c but if what i have said is true when we remove some of the atmospheric pressure the water should boil with a less heat than will cause the mercury in the thermometer to rise to 100 c and if we take off all the pressure the water ought to boil and freeze at the same time this actually happens in the carr icemaking machine the question now arises why does the water freeze in the carr machine all substances require certain amounts of heat to enable them to take and to maintain the liquid state if they are ordinarily solid and the gaseous state if ordinarily liquid or solid and the greater the change of state the greater the heat needed moreover this heat does not make them warm it is simply absorbed or swallowed up and becomes latent and is merely necessary to maintain the new condition assumed in the case of the carr machine liquid water is by removal of the atmospheric pressure coerced as it were to take the gaseous form but to do so it needs to absorb the requisite amount of heat to aid it in taking that form and this heat it must take up from all surrounding warm objects it absorbs quickly all it can get out of itself as liquid water out of the glass vessel containing it and from the surrounding air but the process of gasification with ebullition goes on so quickly that the temperature of the water thus robbed of heat quickly falls to 0 c and the remaining water freezes thus then by pumping out the air from a vessel ie working in a vacuum we can boil a liquid in such exhausted vessel far below its ordinary boiling temperature in the open air this fact is of the utmost industrial importance but touching this question of latent heat you may ask me for my proof that there is latent heat and a large amount of it in a substance that feels perfectly cold i have told you that a gasified liquid or a liquefied solid or most of all a gasified solid contains such heat and if reconverted into liquid and solid forms respectively that heat is evolved or becomes sensible heat and then it can be decidedly felt and indicated by the thermometer take the case of a liquid suddenly solidifying the heat latent in that liquid and necessary to keep it a liquid is no longer necessary and comes out and the substance appears to become hot quicklime is a cold white solid substance but there is a compound of water and limeslaked limewhich is also a solid powdery substance called by the chemist hydrate of lime the water used to slake the quicklime is a liquid and it may be icecold water but to form hydrate of lime it must assume a solid form and hence can and does dispense with its heat of liquefaction in the change of state you all know how hot lime becomes on slaking with water of course we have heat of chemical combination here as well as evolution of latent heat as another example we may take a solution of acetate of soda so strong that it is just on the point of crystallising if it crystallises it solidifies and the liquid consequently gives up its latent heat of liquefaction we will make it crystallise first connecting the tube containing it to another one containing a coloured liquid and closed by a cork carrying a narrow tube dipping into the coloured liquid on crystallising the solution gives off heat as is shown by the expansion of the air in the corked tube and the consequent forcing of the coloured liquid up the narrow tube consequently in your works you never dissolve a salt or crystal in water or other liquid without rendering heat latent or consuming heat you never allow steam to condense in the steam pipes about the premises without losing vastly more heat than possibly many are aware of let us inquire as to the latent heat of water and of steam latent heats of water and steamif we mix 1 kilogram about 2 lb of ice of course at zero or 0 c with 1 kilogram of water at 79 c and stir well till the ice is melted ie has changed its state from solid to liquid we find on putting a thermometer in the temperature is only 0 c this simply means that 79 of heat centigrade degrees have become latent and represent the heat of liquefaction of 1 kilogram of ice had we mixed 1 kilogram of water at 0 c with 1 kilogram of water at 79 c there would have been no change of state and the temperature of the mixture might be represented as a distribution of the 79 c through the whole mass of the 2 kilograms and so would be 3912 c we say therefore the latent heat of water is the heat which is absorbed or rendered latent when a unit of weight say 1 kilogram of water as ice melts and liquefies to a unit of water at zero or it is 79 heat units these 79 units of heat would raise 79 units of weight of liquid water through 1 c or one unit of liquid water through 79 let us now inquire what the latent heat of steam is if we take 1 kilogram of water at 0 c and blow steam from boiling water at 100 c into it until the water just boils and then stop and weigh the resulting water we shall find it amounts to 1187 kilograms so that 0187 kilogram of water which was in the gaseous steam form and had besides a sensible heat of 100 c has changed its state to that of liquid water this liquid water being at the boilingpoint has still the 100 c of sensible heat and hence the water in the gaseous steam form can have given up to the water at 0 c into which it was blown only the latent heat of gasification which was not sensible but by virtue of which it was enabled to assume the gaseous form but if 0187 kilogram of steam at 100 c can heat 1 kilogram of water through 100 degrees then 1 kilogram of steam can raise 536 kilograms of icecold water through 100 degrees or 536 kilograms through 1 degree and thus the latent heat of steam is 536 heat units effect of increase of pressure on the boiling of waternow we have referred to diminution of pressure and its effect on the boilingpoint of water and i may point out that by increasing the pressure such eg as boiling water under a high pressure of steam you raise the boilingpoint there are some industrial operations in which the action of certain boiling solutions is unavailing to effect certain decompositions or other ends when the boiling is carried on under the ordinary atmospheric pressure and boiling in closed and strong vessels under pressure must be resorted to take as an example the woodpulp process for making paper from wood shavings boiling in open pans with caustic soda lye is insufficient to reduce the wood to pulp and so boiling in strong vessels under pressure is adopted the temperature of the solution rises far above 212 f 100 c let us see what may result chemically from the attainment of such high temperatures of water in our steam boilers working under high pressures if you blow ordinary steam at 212 f or 100 c into fats or oils the fats and oils remain undecomposed but suppose you let fatty and oily matters of animal or vegetable origin such as lubricants get into your boiler feedwater and so into your boiler what will happen i have only to tell you that a process is patented for decomposing fats with superheated steam to drive or distil over the admixed fatty acids and glycerin in order to show you that in your boilers such greasy matters will be more or less decomposed fats are neutral as fats and will not injure the iron of the boilers but once decompose them and they are split up into an acid called a fat acid and glycerin that fat acid at the high temperature soon attacks your boilers and pipes and eats away the iron that is one of the curious results that may follow at such high temperatures mineral or hydrocarbon oils do not contain these fat acids and so cannot possibly even with highpressure steam corrode the boiler metal effect of dissolved salts on the boiling of waterlet us inquire what this effect is suppose we dissolve a quantity of a salt in water and then blow steam at 100 c 212 f into that water the latter will boil not at 212 f but at a higher temperature there is a certain industrial process i know of in course of which it is necessary first to maintain a vessel containing water by means of a heated closed steam coil at 212 f 100 c and at a certain stage to raise the temperature to about 327 f 164 c the pressure on the boiler connected with the steam coil is raised to nearly seven atmospheres and thus the heat of the highpressure steam rises to 327 f 164 c and then a considerable quantity of nitrate of ammonium a crystallised salt is thrown into the water in which it dissolves strange to say although the water alone would boil at 212 f a strong solution in water of the ammonium nitrate only boils at 327 f so that the effect of dissolving that salt in the water is the same as if the pressure were raised to seven atmospheres now let us as hat manufacturers learn a practical lesson from this fact we have observed that wool and fur fibres are injured by boiling in pure water and the heat has much to do with this damage but if the boiling take place in bichrome liquors or similar solutions that boiling will according to the strength of the solution in dissolved matters take place at a temperature more or less elevated above the boilingpoint of water and so the damage done will be the more serious the more concentrated the liquors are quite independently of the nature of the substances dissolved in those liquors solutionwe have already seen that when a salt of any kind dissolves in water heat is absorbed and becomes latent in other words cold is produced i will describe a remarkable example or experiment well illustrating this fact if you take some glaubers salt crystallised sulphate of soda and mix it with some hydrochloric acid or spirits of salt then so rapidly will the solution proceed and consequently so great will be the demand for heat that if a vessel containing water be put in amongst the dissolving salt the heat residing in that vessel and its water will be rapidly extracted and the water will freeze as regards solubility some salts and substances are much more quickly and easily dissolved than others we are generally accustomed to think that to dissolve a substance quickly we cannot do better than build a fire under the containing vessel and heat the liquid this is often the correct method of proceeding but not always thus it would mean simply loss of fuel and so waste of heat to do this in dissolving ordinary table salt or rock salt in water for salt is as soluble in cold water as in hot some salts are incredible though it may appear less soluble in boiling water than in cold water just above the freezingpoint dissolves nearly twice as much lime as it does when boiling you see then that a knowledge of certain important facts like these may be so used as to considerably mitigate your coal bills under given circumstances and conditions lecture iv water its chemistry and properties impurities and their action tests of puritycontinued in the last lecture under the head of solution i mentioned that some salts some chemical substances are more soluble in water than others and that their solubilities under different circumstances of temperature vary in different ways however some salts and compounds are practically insoluble in water under any circumstances we now arrive at the important result known to chemists as the precipitation of insoluble compounds from solutions in order to define this result however we must of course first consider the circumstances of causation of the result let us take a simple case of chemical decomposition resulting in the deposition or precipitation of a substance from solution in the insoluble state we will take a salt you are probably acquainted withsulphate of copper or bluestone and dissolve it in water and we have then the sulphate of copper in solution in water now suppose it is our desire to obtain from that solution all the copper by depositing it in some insoluble form we may accomplish this in several different ways relying on certain methods of decomposing that sulphate of copper one of the simplest and most economical is that adopted in a certain socalled wet method of extracting copper it is based on the fact that metallic iron has a greater tendency to combine in water solutions with the acids of copper salts than the copper has in those salts we simply need to place some scraps of iron in the copper sulphate solution to induce a change which may be represented as follows copper sulphate consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid yields with iron iron sulphate a combination of iron oxide with sulphuric acid and metallic copper the metallic copper produced separates in the form of a red coating on the iron scraps but we may also relying on the fact that oxide of copper is insoluble in water arrange for the deposition of the copper in that form this we can do by adding caustic soda to a hot solution of copper sulphate when we get the following change copper sulphate consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid yields with caustic soda sulphate of soda a combination of soda with sulphuric acid and oxide of copper oxide of copper is black and so in this decomposition what is called a black precipitate of that oxide is produced on adding the caustic soda but it might not suit us thus to deposit the copper from our solution we might desire to remove the sulphuric acid from the copper sulphate and leave the copper dissolved say in the form of a chloride we select then a compound which is a chloride and a chloride of a metal which forms an insoluble combination with sulphuric acidchloride of barium say on adding this chloride of barium to sulphate of copper solution we get then a change which we might represent thus copper sulphate consisting of a combination of copper oxide with sulphuric acid yields with barium chloride which is a combination of barium and chlorine insoluble barium sulphate a combination of barium oxide with sulphuric acid and soluble copper chloride a combination of copper and chlorine this is called a double interchange now these are a few illustrations to show you what is meant by chemical decompositions one practical lesson of course we may draw is this we must have a care in dissolving bluestone or copper sulphate not to attempt it in iron pans and not to store or put verdigris into iron vessels or the iron will be acted upon and to some extent the copper salt will become contaminated with iron it will now be clear to you that as a solvent for bodies usually soluble in water water that is perfectly pure will be most suitable and not likely to cause any deposition or precipitation through chemical decompositions for there are no salts or other compounds in pure water to cause such changes such pure water is called soft water but the term is only a comparative one and water that is not quite but nearly purepure enough for most practical purposesis also called soft water now rain is the purest form of natural water for it is a kind of distilled water water rises in vapour from the ocean as from a still and the salt and other dissolved matters remain behind meeting cold currents of air the vapours condense in rain and fall upon the earth after coming in contact with the earth the subsequent condition of that water entirely depends upon the character as regards solubility or insolubility of the substances composing the strata or layers of earth upon which it falls and through which it sinks if it meets with insoluble rocksfor all rocks are not insolubleit remains of course pure and soft and in proportion as the constituents of rock and soil are soluble in that proportion does the water become hard we all know how dangerous acid is in water causing that water to act on many substances the iron of iron vessels the lime in soil or rock etc bringing iron and lime respectively into solution now the atmosphere contains carbonic acid and carbonic acid occurs in the earth being evolved by decomposing vegetation etc carbonic acid is also soluble to a certain though not large extent in water as we shall see water charged with carbonic acid attacks certain substances insoluble in pure water and brings them into solution and thus the water soon becomes hard about the close of the last lecture i said that lime is to a certain extent soluble in cold water the solution is called limewater it might be called a solution of caustic lime when carbonic acid gas first comes in contact with such a solution chalk or carbonate of lime which is insoluble in water is formed and the lime is thus precipitated as carbonate supposing however we continued to pass carbonic acid gas into that water rendered milky with chalk powder very soon the liquid would clear and we should get once more a solution of lime but not caustic lime as it was at first simply now a solution of carbonate of lime in carbonic acid or a solution of bicarbonate of lime i will take some limewater and i will blow through my breath contains carbonic acid and you will see the clear liquid become milky owing to separation of insoluble carbonate of lime or chalk i now continue blowing and at length that chalk dissolves with the excess of carbonic acid forming bicarbonate of lime this experiment explains how it is that water percolating through or running over limestone strata dissolves out the insoluble chalk such water hard from dissolved carbonate of lime can be softened by merely boiling the water for the excess of carbonic acid is then expelled and the chalk is precipitated again this would be too costly for the softening of large quantities of water the boiling process consuming too much coal and so another process is adopted quicklime or milk of lime is added to the water in the proper quantity this lime unites with the excess of carbonic acid holding chalk in solution and forms with it insoluble chalk and so all deposits together as chalk by this liming process also the iron of the water dissolved likewise in ferruginous streams etc by carbonic acid would be precipitated to show this deposition i will now add some clear limewater to the solution i made of chalk with the carbonic acid of my breath and a precipitate is at once formed all the lime and carbonic acid together depositing as insoluble chalk hence clear limewater forms a good test for the presence of bicarbonates of lime or iron in a water but water may be hard from the presence of other salts other lime salts for example certain parts of the earth contain a great deal of gypsum or natural sulphate of lime and this is soluble to some extent in water water thus hardened is not affected by boiling or the addition of lime and is therefore termed permanently hard water the water hardened with dissolved chalk being termed temporarily hard water i have said nothing of solid or undissolved impurities in water which are said to be in suspension for the separation of these is a merely mechanical matter of settling or filtration and settling combined as a general rule the water of rivers contains the most suspended and vegetable matter and the least amount of dissolved constituents whereas spring and well waters contain the most dissolved matters and the least suspended serious damage may be done to the dyer by either of these classes of impurities and i may tell you that the dissolved calcareous and magnesian impurities are the most frequent in occurrence and the most injurious i told you that on boiling the excess of carbonic acid holding chalk or carbonate of lime in solution as bicarbonate is decomposed and carbonate of lime precipitated you can at once imagine then what takes place in your steam boilers when such water is used and how incrustations are formed let us now inquire as to the precise nature of the waste and injury caused by hard and impure waters let us also take as an example those most commonly occurring injurious constituents the magnesian and calcareous impurities hard water only produces a lather with soap when that soap has effected the softening of the water and not till then in that process the soap is entirely wasted and the fatty acids in it form with the lime and magnesia insoluble compounds called lime and magnesia soaps which are sticky greasy adhesive bodies that precipitate and fix some colouring matters like a mordant we have in such cases then a kind of double mischiefi waste of soap ii injury to colours and dyes on the fabrics but this is not all for colours are precipitated as lakes and mordants also are precipitated and thus wasted in much the same sense as the soaps are now by taking a soap solution formed by dissolving a known weight of soap in a known volume of water and adding this gradually to hard water until a permanent lather is just produced we can directly determine the consumption of soap by such a water and ascertain the hardness such a method is called clarks process of determination or testing or clarks soap test we hear a great deal just now of soaps that will wash well in hard water and do wonders under any conditions but mark this fact none of them will begin to perform effective duty until such hard water has been rendered soft at the expense of the soap soaps made of some oils such as cocoanut oil for example are more soluble in water than when made of tallow etc and so they more quickly soften a hard water and yield lather but they are wasted as far as consumption is concerned to just the same extent as any other soaps they do not however waste so much time and trouble in effecting the end in view and as you know time is money in these days of work and competition after making a soap test as described above and knowing the quantity of water used it is of course easy to calculate the annual loss of soap caused by the hardness of the water the monthly consumption of soap in london is 1000000 kilograms about 1000 tons and it is estimated that the hardness of the thames water means the use of 230000 kilograms nearly 230 tons more soap per month than would be necessary if soft water were used of course the soap manufacturers around london would not state that fact on their advertising placards but rather dwell on the victorious onslaught their particular brand will make on the dirt in articles to be washed in the teeth of circumstances that would be hopeless for any other brand of soap i have referred to the sticky and adhesive character of the compounds called lime soaps formed in hard waters now in washing and scouring wool and other fibres these sticky lime soaps adhere so pertinaciously that the fibres be they of wool silk or any other article remain in part untouched impermeable to mordant or colouring matter and hence irregular development of colour must be the consequence also an unnatural lustre or peculiar bloom may in parts arise ruining the appearance of the goods in some cases the lime soaps act like mordants attracting colouring matter unequally and producing patchy effects in the dyebaths in which catechu and tannin are used there is a waste of these matters for insoluble compounds are formed with the lime and the catechu and tannin are to a certain extent precipitated and lost some colours are best developed in an acid bath such as cochineal scarlet but the presence of the bicarbonate of lime tends to cause neutralisation of the acidity and so the dyeing is either retarded or prevented such mordants as red liquor and iron liquor which are acetates of alumina and iron respectively are also wasted a portion of them being precipitated by the lime thus weakening the mordant baths ferruginous impurities in wateriron in solution in water is very objectionable in dyeing operations when the iron is present as bicarbonate it acts on soap solutions like the analogous lime and magnesia compounds producing even worse results in wool scouring cotton bleaching and other processes requiring the use of alkaline carbonates ferric oxide is precipitated on the fibre a yellowish tinge is communicated to bleached fabrics and to dye bright and light colours is rendered almost out of the question you may always suspect iron to be present in water flowing from or obtained directly out of old coal pits iron mines or from places abounding in iron and aluminous shales moreover you sometimes or rather generally find that surface water draining off moorland districts and passing over ochre beds contains iron and on its way deposits on the beds of the streamlets conveying it and on the stones red or brown oxide of iron all water of this kind ought to be avoided in dyeing and similar operations the iron in water from old coal pits and shale deposits is usually present as sulphate due to the oxidation of pyrites a sulphuret or sulphide of iron water from heaths and moorlands is often acid from certain vegetable acids termed peaty acids this acidity places the water in the condition of a direct solvent for iron and that dissolved iron may cause great injury if such water cannot be dispensed with the best way is to carefully neutralise it with carbonate of soda the iron is then precipitated as carbonate of iron and can be removed contamination of water by factoriesyou may have neighbours higher up the stream than yourselves and these firms may cast forth as waste products substances which will cause immense waste and loss amongst these waste products the worst are those coming from chemical works paper works bleach works etc if the paper works be those working up wood pulp the pollutions of effluent water will be about as noxious as they well can be you will have gums and resins from the wood calcium chloride from the bleach vats acids from the sours resin and resinsoaps there may also be alumina salts present now alumina lime resin and resinsoaps etc precipitate dyestuffs and also soap if the water is alkaline some of the mordants used may be precipitated and wasted and very considerable damage done permanent hardness in water due to the presence of gypsum or sulphate of lime in solution may be remedied by addition of caustic soda of course if an alkaline water is objectionable in any process the alkali would have to be neutralised by the addition of some acid for use in boilers water might thus be treated but it would become costly if large quantities required such treatment water rendered impure by contaminations from dyehouses and some chemical works can be best purified and most cheaply by simple liming followed by a settling process if space is limited and much water is required instead of the settling reservoirs filtering beds of coke sand etc may be used the lime used neutralises acids in the contaminated and impure water precipitates colouring matters mordants soap albuminous matters etc tests of purityi will now describe a few tests that may be of value to you in deciding as to what substances are contaminating any impure waters that may be at hand ironif to a water you suspect to be hard from presence of carbonate of lime or carbonate of iron in solution in carbonic acid ie as bicarbonates you add some clear limewater and a white precipitate is produced you have a proof of carbonate of limehardness if the precipitate is brownish you may have also carbonate of iron i will now mention a very delicate test for iron such a test would be useful in confirmation if a very dilute solution of such iron water be treated with a drop or two of pure hydrochloric acid and a drop or so of permanganate of potash solution or of condys fluid and after that a few drops of yellow prussiate of potash solution be added then a blue colour prussian blue either at once or after standing a few hours proves the presence of iron coppersometimes as in the neighbourhood of copper mines or of some copper pyrites deposits a water may be contaminated with small quantities of copper the yellow prussiate once more forms a good test but to ensure the absence of free mineral acids it is first well to add a little acetate of soda solution a drop or two of the prussiate solution then gives a brown colour even if but traces of copper are present magnesiasuppose lime and magnesia are present you may first evaporate to a small bulk adding a drop of hydrochloric acid if the liquid becomes muddy then add ammonia and ammonium oxalate when lime alone is precipitated as the oxalate of lime filter through blotting paper and to the clear filtrate add some phosphate of soda solution a second precipitation proves the presence of magnesia sulphatesa solution of barium chloride and dilute hydrochloric acid gives a white turbidity chloridesa solution of silver nitrate and nitric acid gives a white curdy precipitate test for lead in drinking wateri will lastly give you a test that will be useful in your own homes to detect minute quantities of lead in water running through lead pipes place a large quantity of the water in a glass on a piece of white paper and add a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen and let stand for some time a brown colour denotes lead of course copper would also yield a brown coloration but i am supposing that the circumstances preclude the presence of copper i have already said that rain water is the purest of natural waters it is so soft and free from dissolved mineral matters because it is a distilled water in distilling water to purify it we must be very careful what material we use for condensing the steam in since it is a fact probably not sufficiently well known that the softer and purer a water is the more liable it is to attack lead pipes hence a coil of lead pipe to serve as condensing worm would be inadmissible such water as manchester water and glasgow water from loch katrine still more so are more liable to attack lead pipes than the hard london waters to illustrate this fact we will distil some water and condense in a leaden worm then on testing the water with our reagent the sulphuretted hydrogen water a brown colour is produced showing the presence of lead on condensing in a block tin worm however no tin is dissolved so tin is safer and better as the material for such a purpose than lead filtrationwe hear a great deal about filtration or filters as universal means of purifying water filtration we must remember will as a rule only remove solid or suspended impurities in water for example if we take some ivory black or bone black and mix it with water and afterwards filter the black liquid through blottingpaper the bone black remains on the paper and clear pure water comes through filtering is effective here if we take some indigo solution however and pour it on to the filter the liquid runs through as blue as it was when poured upon the filter filtering is ineffective here and is so generally with liquids containing matters dissolved in them but i said generally and so the question is suggestedwill filtration of any kind remove matters in solution this question i will in conclusion try to answer bone charcoal or bone black has a wonderful attraction for many organic matters such as colours dyes and coloured impurities like those in peat water raw sugar solutions etc for example if we place on a paper filter some bone black and filter through it some indigo solution after first warming the latter with some more of the bone black the liquid comes through clear all the indigo being absorbed in some peculiar way difficult to explain by the bone black and remaining on the filter this power of charcoal also extends to gases and to certain noxious dissolved organic impurities but it is never safe to rely too much on such filters since the charcoal can at length become charged with impurities and gradually cease to act these filters need cleaning and renewing from time to time lecture v acids and alkalis properties of acids and alkalisthe name acids is given to a class of substances mostly soluble in water having an acid or sour taste and capable of turning blue litmus solution red all acids contain one or more atoms of hydrogen capable of being replaced by metals and when such hydrogen atoms are completely replaced by metals there result socalled neutral or normal salts that is neutral substances having no action on litmus solution these salts can also be produced by the union of acids with equivalent quantities of certain metallic oxides or hydroxides called bases of which those soluble in water are termed alkalis alkalis have a caustic taste and turn red litmus solution blue in order to explain what is called the law of equivalence i will remind you of the experiment of the previous lecture when a piece of bright iron being placed in a solution of copper sulphate became coated with metallic copper an equivalent weight of iron meanwhile suffering solution as sulphate of iron according to the same law a certain weight of soda would always require a certain specific equivalent weight of an acid say hydrochloric acid to neutralise its alkaline or basic properties producing a salt the specific gravities of acids and alkalis in solution are made use of in works etc as a means of ascertaining their strengths and commercial values tables have been carefully constructed such that for every degree of specific gravity a corresponding percentage strength of acidity and alkalinity may be looked up the best tables for this purpose are given in lunge and hurters alkalimakers pocketbook but for ordinary purposes of calculation in the works or factory a convenient relationship exists in the case of hydrochloric acid between specific gravity and percentage of real acid such that specific gravity as indicated by twaddells hydrometer directly represents percentage of real acid in any sample of hydrochloric acid the point at which neutralisation of an acid by alkali or vice vers just takes place is ascertained very accurately by the use of certain sensitive colours at first litmus and cochineal tinctures were used but in testing crude alkalis containing alumina and iron it was found that lakes were formed with these colours and they become precipitated in the solution and so no longer sensitive the chemist was then obliged to resort to certain sensitive coaltar colours which did not as the dyer and printer knew form lakes with alumina and iron such as methyl orange fluorescein congo red phenolphthalein and so forth for determining the alkalimetric strength of commercial sodas a known weight of the sample is dissolved in water and a few drops of a solution of methyl orange are added which colour the solution yellow or orange into this solution is then run from a burette or graduated tube a standard solution of an acid that is a solution prepared by dissolving a known weight of an acid say hydrochloric acid in a known volume of water the acid is run in gradually until the yellow colour changes to pink at which point the volume of acid used is noted knowing the weight of acid contained in this volume of standard acid and having regard to the law of equivalence mentioned above it is an easy matter to calculate the amount of alkali equivalent to the acid used and from this the alkali contained in the sample sulphuric acidthe first process for manufacturing sulphuric acid or vitriol was by placing some burning sulphur in a closed vessel containing some water the water absorbed the acid formed by the burning sulphur it was next discovered that by mixing with the sulphur some nitre much more sulphuric acid could be produced per given quantity of brimstone at first large glass carboys were used but in 1746 the carboys were replaced by chambers of lead containing water at the bottom and in these lead chambers the mixture of sulphur and nitre was burnt on iron trays next although gradually the plant was divided into two portionsa furnace for burning the sulphur and a chamber for receiving the vapours the system was thus developed into the one followed at the present time the sulphur or in most cases cupreous iron pyrites a combination of iron and copper with sulphur is burned in specially constructed kilns or furnaces and the hot gases consisting essentially of sulphur dioxide with the excess of air pass through flues in which are placed castiron nitre pots containing a mixture of nitre sodium nitrate and vitriol the gases thus become mixed with nitrous fumes or gaseous oxides of nitrogen and after cooling are ready for mixing with steam or water spray in the lead chambers in which the vitriol is produced these oxides of nitrogen enable the formation of sulphuric acid to take place more quickly by playing the part of oxygencarriers sulphuric acid is formed by the union of oxygen with sulphur dioxide and water the oxides of nitrogen combine with the oxygen of the air present in the chambers then give up this oxygen to the sulphur dioxide and water or steam to form sulphuric acid again combine with more oxygen and so on the exact processes or reactions are of course much more complicated but the above represents what is practically the ultimate result it is evident that the gases leaving the last lead chamber in which the formation of vitriol is effected must still contain nitrous fumes and it becomes a matter of importance to recover them so that they can be used over again to effect this object use is made of the solubility of nitrous fumes in strong vitriol the gases from the last lead chamber of the series are passed through what is called a gaylussac tower the process was invented by the eminent french chemist gaylussac which is a tower made of lead supported by a wooden framework and filled with coke or special stoneware packing over which strong vitriol is caused to flow the vitriol dissolves the nitrogen oxides and socalled nitrous vitriol flows out at the base of the tower the recovery of the nitrogen compounds from the nitrous vitriol is effected in glover towers the invention of john glover of newcastle which also serve to concentrate to some extent the weak acid produced in the lead chambers and to cool the hot gases from the sulphur burners or pyrites kilns the weak chamber acid is mixed with the nitrous vitriol from the gaylussac tower and the mixture is pumped to the top of the glover tower which is of similar construction to the gaylussac tower but is generally packed with flints this glover tower is placed between the sulphur burners or pyrites kilns and the first lead chamber the nitrous vitriol passing down the tower meets the hot gases from the kilns and a threefold object is effected 1 the nitrous fumes are expelled from the nitrous vitriol and are carried into the chambers to again play the part of oxygencarriers 2 the weak chamber acid which was mixed with the nitrous vitriol is concentrated by the hot kiln gases and 3 the hot gases themselves are cooled the acid from the glover tower is purified by special treatmentfor example the arsenic may be removed after precipitation with sulphuretted hydrogen in the form of insoluble arsenic sulphideand the purified acid is concentrated by heating in glass or platinum vessels a considerable amount of sulphuric acid is now made by the socalled contact process in which sulphur dioxide and oxygen unite to form sulphuric acid in presence of a heated contact substance usually some form of finelydivided platinum nitric acidthis acid is usually prepared by distilling a mixture of sodium nitrate and vitriol in castiron retorts or pots the nitric acid being collected in stoneware vessels connected one with another or as is more generally the case at the present time in condensing apparatus consisting of stoneware pipes or coils cooled by water the effluent gases are passed through a scrubber in order to free them from the last traces of acid before discharging them into the atmosphere hydrochloric acidthe greater part of the hydrochloric acid manufactured in great britain is obtained as an intermediate product in the leblanc alkali process which will presently be described being produced by heating common salt with vitriol a large quantity is however also produced by the socalled direct process of hargreaves robinson which is in principle the same method as that employed in the leblanc process except that the intermediate product vitriol is not separated it consists essentially in passing the hot gases from pyrites kilns as used in the manufacture of vitriol through large castiron vessels containing common salt heated to a high temperature various physical conditions must be complied with in order to make the process a success for example the salt is used in the form of moulded hard porous cakes made from a damp mixture of common salt and rock salt the castiron vessels must be heated uniformly and the hot pyrites kiln gases must be passed downwards through the salt in order to ensure uniform distribution the hydrochloric acid is condensed in stoneware pipes connected with towers packed with coke or stoneware alkali leblanc processthe manufacture of vitriol as i have described it to you is the first step in the leblanc process the next stage consists in the manufacture of sodium sulphate saltcake and hydrochloric acid from the sulphuric acid and common salt this is called the saltcake process the production of saltcake or crude sodium sulphate is carried out in two stages a large covered iron pan called the decomposing pan or saltcake pot is mounted in one part of the saltcake furnace and alongside it is the hearth or bed on which the second stage of the process the drying or roasting is effected the mixture of common salt and vitriol is charged into the saltcake pot which is heated by a fire below when from twothirds to threequarters of the hydrochloric acid has been expelled from the charge the mass acquires the consistence of thick dough and at this stage it is raked out of the pan on to the roasting hearth alongside where the decomposition is completed by means of flames playing directly on to the top of the charge the hydrochloric acid evolved during the process is condensed in much the same manner as in the process of hargreaves robinson previously described it is a curious fact that in the earlier years of the leblanc process hydrochloric acid or spirits of salt as it is frequently called was a byproduct that required all the vigilance of the alkaliworks inspectors to prevent it being allowed to escape from the chimneys in more than a certain small regulated amount now it is the principal product indeed the leblanc alkali maker may be said to subsist on that hydrochloric acid as his chief instrument for producing chloride of lime or bleaching powder mechanical furnaces are now used to a large extent for the saltcake process they consist broadly of a large revolving furnacehearth or bed on to which the mixture of salt and vitriol is charged and on which it is continuously agitated and gradually moved to the place of discharge by rakes or the like operated by suitable machinery the next stage of the leblanc process is the manufacture of black ash or crude sodium carbonate this is usually done in large cylindrical revolving furnaces through which flames from a firegrate or from the burning of gaseous fuel pass the waste heat is utilised for boiling down black ash liquor obtained by lixiviating the black ash a mixture of saltcake limestone or chalk calcium carbonate and powdered coal or coal slack is charged into the revolving cylinder during the process the mass becomes agglomerated and the final product is what is known as a blackash ball consisting chiefly of crude sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide but containing smaller quantities of many other substances the soda ash or sodium carbonate is obtained from the black ash by lixiviating with water and after various purification processes the solution is boiled down as previously stated by the waste heat of the blackash furnace the alkali is sold in various forms as soda ash soda crystals washing soda etc caustic soda is manufactured from solution of carbonate of soda by causticising that is treatment with caustic lime or quicklime it will have been noticed that one of the chief reagents in the leblanc process is the sulphur used in the form of brimstone or as pyrites for making vitriol in the first stage this sulphur goes through the entire process from the vitriol it goes to form a constituent of the saltcake and afterwards of the calcium sulphide contained in the black ash this calcium sulphide remains as an insoluble mass when the carbonate of soda is extracted from the black ash and forms the chief constituent of the alkali waste which until the year 1880 could be seen in large heaps around chemical works now however by means of treatment with kiln gases containing carbonic acid the sulphur is extracted from the waste in the form of hydrogen sulphide which is burnt to form vitriol or is used for making pure sulphur and so what was once waste is now a source of profit ammoniasoda process of alkali manufacturethis process depends upon the fact that when carbonic acid is forced under pressure into a saturated solution of ammonia and common salt sodium bicarbonate is precipitated whilst ammonium chloride or salammoniac remains dissolved in the solution the reaction was discovered in 1836 by a scotch chemist named john thom and small quantities of ammoniasoda were made at that time by the firm of mcnaughton thom the successful carrying out of the process on the large scale depends principally upon the complete recovery of the expensive reagent ammonia and this problem was only solved within comparatively recent years by solvay the process has been perfected and worked with great success in england by messrs brunner mond co and has proved a successful rival to the leblanc process alkali is also produced to some extent by electrolytic processes depending upon the splitting up of a solution of common salt into caustic soda and chlorine by the use of an electric current lecture vi boric acid borax soap boric acidat ordinary temperatures and under ordinary conditions boric acid is a very weak acid but like silicic and some other acids its relative powers of affinity and combination become very much changed at high temperatures thus fused and strongly heated boric acid can decompose carbonates and even sulphates and yet a current of so weak an acid as hydrogen sulphide passed through a strong solution of borax will decompose it and set free boric acid boric acid is obtained chiefly from italy in a tract of country called the maremma of tuscany embracing an area of about forty square miles are numerous chasms and crevices from which hot vapour and heated gases and springs of water spurt the steam issuing from these hot springs contains small quantities of boric acid that acid being one of those solid substances distilling to some extent in a current of steam the steam vapours thus bursting forth owing to some kind of constant volcanic disturbance are also more or less laden with sulphuretted hydrogen gas communicating a very ill odour to the neighbourhood these phenomena were at first looked upon by the people as the work of the devil and priestly exorcisms were in considerable request in the hope of quelling them very much as a great deal of the mere speechmaking at the present time in england on foreign competition and its evils and the dulness of trade the artificial combinations to keep up prices to reduce wages general lamentation etc are essayed in the attempt to charm away bad trade at length a kind of prophet arose of a very practical character in the form of the late count lardarel who mindful of the fact that the chemist hffer in the time of the grand duke leopold i had discovered boric acid in the volcanic steam jets looked hopefully beyond the exorcisms of the priests and the superstitions of the people to a possible blessing contained in what appeared to be an unholy confusion of nature he constructed tanks of from 100 to 1000 ft in diameter and 7 to 20 ft in depth of such a kind that the steam jets were surrounded by or contained in them and thus the liquors formed by condensation became more and more concentrated these tanks were arranged at different levels so that the liquors could be run off from one to the other and finally to settling cisterns subsequently the strong liquors were run to leadlined wooden vats in which the boric acid was crystallised out had the industry depended on the use of fuel it could never have developed but count lardarel ingeniously utilised the heat of the steam for all the purposes and neither coal nor wood was required where would that tuscan boric acid industry have been now had merely the lamentations of landowners fears of the people and exorcisms of the priests been continued instead of being the work of the archenemy of mankind was not it rather an incitement to a somewhat high and difficult step in an upward direction towards the attainment on a higher platform of knowledge and skill of a blessing for the whole province of tuscany what was true in the history of that industry and its development is every whit as true of the muchlamented slackening of trade through foreign competition or other causes now in this country and coming home to yourselves in the hatmanufacturing industry the higher platform to which it was somewhat difficult to step up but upon which the battle must be fought and the victory won was one of a higher scientific and technological education and training the chemist hffer made the discovery of boric acid in the vapours they would no doubt take note but hffer went no further and it needed the man of both educated and practical mind like count lardarel to turn the discovery to account and extract the blessing in like manner it was clear that in our educational schemes for the benefit of the people there must not only be the scientific investigator of abstract truth but also the scientific technologist to point the way to the practical realisation of tangible profit moreover and a still more important truth it is the scientific education of the proprietors and heads we wanteducated capital rather than educated workmen boraxa good deal of the tuscan boric acid is used in france for the manufacture of borax which is a sodium salt of boric acid borax is also manufactured from boronitrocalcite a calcium salt of boric acid which is found in chili and other parts of south america the crude boronitrocalcite or tiza is boiled with sodium carbonate solution and after settling the borax is obtained by crystallisation borax itself is found in california and nevada usa and also in peru ceylon china persia and thibet the commercial product is obtained from the native borax known as tincal by dissolving in water and allowing the solution to crystallise the peruvian borax sometimes contains nitre for testing the purity of refined borax the following simple tests will usually suffice a solution of the borax is made containing 1 part of borax to 50 parts of water and small portions of the solution are tested as follows heavy metals lead copper etcon passing sulphuretted hydrogen into the solution no coloration or precipitate should be produced calcium saltsthe solution should not give a precipitate with ammonium oxalate solution carbonatesthe solution should not effervesce on addition of nitric or hydrochloric acid chloridesno appreciable precipitate should be produced on addition of silver nitrate solution and nitric acid sulphatesno appreciable precipitate should be produced on adding hydrochloric acid and barium chloride iron50 cc of the solution should not immediately be coloured blue by 05 cc of potassium ferrocyanide solution soapsoap is a salt in the chemical sense and this leads to a wider definition of the term salt or saline compound fats and oils from which soaps are manufactured are a kind of quasi salts composed of a fatty acid and a chemical constant if i may use the term in the shape of base namely glycerin when these fats and oils often called glycerides are heated with alkali soda a true salt of the fatty acid and soda is formed and this is the soap whilst the glycerin remains behind in the spent soap lye now glycerin is soluble in water containing dissolved salt brine whilst soap is insoluble though soluble in pure water the mixture of soap and glycerin produced from the fat and soda is therefore treated with brine a process called cutting the soap the soap separates out in the solid form as a curdy mass which can be easily separated certain soaps are able to absorb a large quantity of water and yet appear quite solid and in purchasing large quantities of soap it is necessary therefore to determine the amount of water present this can be easily done by weighing out ten or twenty grams of the soap cut in small pieces into a porcelain dish and heating over a gas flame whilst keeping the soap continually stirred until a glass held over the dish no longer becomes blurred by escaping steam after cooling the dry soap is weighed and the loss of weight represents the amount of moisture i have known cases where soap containing about 83 per cent of water has been sold at the full market price some soaps also contain more alkali than is actually combined with the fatty acids of the soap and that excess alkali is injurious in washing silks and scouring wool and is also not good for the skin the presence of this free or excess alkali can be at once detected by rubbing a little phenolphthalein solution on to the freshlycut surface of a piece of soap if free alkali be present a red colour will be produced lecture vii shellac wood spirit and the stiffening and proofing process shellacthe resin tribe of which shellac is a member comprises vegetable products of a certain degree of similarity they are mostly solid glassylooking substances insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and wood spirit in many cases the alcoholic solutions show an acid reaction the resins are partly soluble in alkalis with formation of a kind of alkali salts which we may call resinsoaps shellac is obtained from the resinous incrustation produced on the bark of the twigs and branches of various tropical trees by the puncture of the female lac insect taccardia lacca the lac is removed from the twigs by beating in water the woody matter floats to the surface and the resin sinks to the bottom and when removed forms what is known as seedlac formerly the solution which contains the colouring matter dissolved from the crude sticklac was evaporated for recovery of the socalled lacdye but the latter is no longer used technically the seedlac is bleached by boiling with sodium or potassium carbonate alum or borax and then if it is not pale enough is further bleached by exposure to sunlight it is now dried melted and mixed with a certain proportion of rosin or of orpiment a sulphide of arsenic according to the purpose for which it is desired after further operations of melting and straining the lac is melted and spread into thin sheets to form ordinary shellac or is melted and dropped on to a smooth surface to form buttonlac ordinary shellac almost invariably contains some rosin but good buttonlac is free from this substance the presence of 5 per cent of rosin in shellac can be detected by dissolving in a little alcohol pouring the solution into water and drying the fine impalpable powder which separates this powder is extracted with petroleum spirit and the solution shaken with water containing a trace of copper acetate if rosin be present the petroleum spirit will be coloured emeraldgreen borax soda crystals and ammonia are all used to dissolve shellac and it may be asked which of these is least injurious to wool and why how is their action modified by the presence of dilute sulphuric acid in the wool i would say that soda crystals and ammonia are alkalis and if used strong are sure to do a certain amount of injury to the fibre of wool and more if used hot than cold of the two the ammonia will have the least effect especially if dilute but borax is better than either the influence of a little sulphuric acid in the wool would be in the direction of neutralising some of the ammonia or soda and shellac if dissolved in the alkalis would be to some extent precipitated on the fibre unless the alkali soda or ammonia were present in sufficient excess to neutralise that sulphuric acid and to leave a sufficient balance to keep the shellac in solution borax which is a borate of soda would be so acted on by the sulphuric acid that some boric acid would be set free the sulphuric acid robbing some of that borax of its soda this boric acid would not be nearly so injurious to wool as carbonate of soda or ammonia would the best solvent for shellac however in the preparation of the stiffening and proofing mixture for hats is probably wood spirit or methylated spirit a solution of shellac in wood spirit is indeed used for the spiritproofing of silk hats and to some extent of felt hats and on the whole the best work i believe is done with it moreover borax is not a cheap agent and being nonvolatile it is all left behind in the proofed material whereas wood spirit or methylated spirit is a volatile liquid ie a liquid easily driven off in vapour and after application to the felt it may be almost all recovered again for reuse in this way i conceive the use of wood spirit would be both more effective and also cheaper than that of borax besides being most suitable in the case of any kind of dyes and colours to be subsequently applied to the hats wood spiritwood spirit the pure form of which is methyl alcohol is one of the products of the destructive distillation of wood the wood is distilled in large iron retorts connected to apparatus for condensing the distillation products the heating is conducted slowly at first so that the maximum yield of the valuable productswood acid acetic acid and wood spiritwhich distil at a low temperature is obtained when the condensed products are allowed to settle they separate into two distinct layers the lower one consisting of a thick very dark tar whilst the upper one much larger in quantity is the crude wood acid containing also the wood spirit and is reddishyellow or reddishbrown in colour this crude wood acid is distilled and the wood spirit which distils off first is collected separately from the acetic acid which afterwards comes over the acid is used for the preparation of alumina and iron mordants see next lecture or is neutralised with lime forming grey acetate of lime from which subsequently pure acetic acid or acetone is prepared the crude wood spirit is mixed with milk of lime and after standing for several hours is distilled in a rectifying still the distillate is diluted with water run off from any oily impurities which are separated and redistilled once or twice after treatment with quicklime stiffening and proofing processbefore proceeding to discuss the stiffening and proofing of hat forms or bodies it will be well to point out that it was in thoroughly grasping the importance of a rational and scientific method of carrying out this process that continental hat manufacturers had been able to steal a march upon their english rivals in competition as to a special kind of hat which sold well on the continent there are or ought to be three aims in the process of proofing and stiffening all the three being of equal importance these are first to waterproof the hatforms second to stiffen them at the same time and by the same process and the third the one the importance of which i think english hat manufacturers have frequently overlooked at least in the past is to so proof and stiffen the hatforms as to leave them in a suitable condition for the subsequent dyeing process in proofing the felt the fibres become varnished over with a kind of glaze which is insoluble in water and this varnish or proof is but imperfectly removed from the ends of the fibres on the upper surface of the felt the consequence is a too slight penetration of the dyestuff into the inner pores of the fibres indeed in the logwood black dyeing of such proofed felt a great deal of the colour becomes precipitated on the outside of the fibresa kind of process of smudgingon of a black pigment taking place the subsequent greening of the black hats after a short period of wear is simply due to the ease with which such badly fixed dye rubs off washes off or wears off the brownish or yellowish substratum which gradually comes to light causing a greenish shade to at length appear if we examine under the microscope a pure unproofed fur fibre its characteristic structure is quite visible examination of an unproofed fibre dyed with logwood black shows again the same characteristic structure with the dye inside the fibre colouring it a beautiful bluishgrey tint the inner cellular markings being black a proofed fur fibre on the other hand when examined under the microscope is seen to be covered with a kind of translucent glaze which completely envelops it and prevents the beautiful markings showing the scaly structure of the fibre from being seen finally if we examine microscopically a proofed fibre which has been dyed or which we have attempted to dye with logwood black we find that the fibre presents an appearance similar to that of rope which has been drawn through some black pigment or black mud and then dried it is quite plain that no lustrous appearance or good finish can be expected from such material now how did the continental hat manufacturers achieve their success both as regards dyeing either with logwood black or with coaltar colours and also getting a high degree of finish they attained their object by rubbing the proofing varnish on the inside of the hat bodies in some cases first protecting the outside with a gumvarnish soluble in water but resisting the lacvarnish rubbed inside thus the proofing could never reach the outside on throwing the hat bodies thus proofed by a logical and scientific process into the dyebath the gums on the outer surface are dissolved and removed and the dye strikes into a pure clean fibre capable of a high degree of finish this process however whilst very good for the softer hats used on the continent is not so satisfactory for the harder stiffer headgear demanded in great britain what was needed was a process which would allow of a throughandthrough proofing and stiffening and also of satisfactory dyeing of the stiffened and proofed felt this was accomplished by a process patented in 1887 by mr fw cheetham and called the veneering process the hat bodies proofed as hard as usual are thrown into a bumping machine containing hot water rendered faintly acid with sulphuric acid and mixed with shortstaple fur or wool usually of a finer quality than that of which the hat bodies are composed the hot acid water promotes in a high degree the felting powers of the shortstaple wool or fur and to a lesser extent the thinly proofed ends of the fibres projecting from the surfaces of the proofed hatforms thus the shortstaple wool or fur felts itself on to the fibres already forming part of the hat bodies and a new layer of pure unproofed wool or fur is gradually wrought on to the proofed surface the hatforms are then taken out and washed and can be dyed with the greatest ease and with excellent results as will be seen from the accompanying illustration see fig 15 this successful invention emphasises the value of the microscope in the study of processes connected with textile fibres i would strongly advise everyone interested in hat manufacturing or similar industries to make a collection of wool and fur fibres and mount them on microscope slides so as to form a kind of index collection for reference illustration fig 15 1 natural wool fibre unproofed 2 wool fibre showing proof on surface filling up the cells and rendering the same dyeproof 3 fur fibre from surface of veneered felt showing dye deposited in cells and on the surface bright and lustrous 4 wool fibre as in no 2 with dye deposited on surface of proof 5 section of proofed and veneered body showing unproofed surface 6 section of proofed body without veneer lecture viii mordants their nature and use the name or word mordant indicates the empiricism or our old friend the rule of thumb of the age in which it was first created and used it serves as a landmark of that age which by the way needed landmarks for it was an age of something between scientific twilight and absolute darkness morder in french derived from the latin mordere means to bite and formerly the users of mordants in dyeing and printing believed their action to be merely a mechanical action that is that they exerted a biting or corroding influence serving to open the pores of the fabrics and thus to give more ready ingress to the colour or dye most mordants are salts or bodies resembling salts and hence we must commence our study of mordants by a consideration of the nature of salts i have already told you that acids are characterised by what we term an acid reaction upon certain vegetable and artificial colours whilst bases or basic substances in solution especially alkalis restore those colours or turn them to quite another shade the acids do the one thing and the alkalis and soluble bases do the opposite the strongest and most soluble bases are the alkalissoda potash and ammonia you all know probably that a drop of vitriol allowed to fall on a black felt hat will stain that hat red if the hat has been dyed with logwood black and if you want to restore the black you can do this by touching the stain with a drop of strong ammonia but the use of a black felt hat as a means of detecting acidity or alkalinity would not commend itself to an economic mind and we find a very excellent reagent for the purpose in extract of litmus or litmus tincture as well as in blotting paper stained therewith the litmus is turned bright red by acids and blue by alkalis if the acid is exactly neutralised by that is combined with the alkaline base to form fully neutralised salts the litmus paper takes a purple tint coloured reagents such as litmus are termed indicators a substance called phenolphthalein a coaltar product is a very delicate indicator it is more sensitive to acids than litmus is now there are some salts which contain a preponderance of acid in their composition ie in which the acid has not been fully neutralised by the base such salts are termed acid salts bicarbonate of soda is one of these acid salts but so feeble is carbonic acid in its acid properties and practical evidences that we shall see both monocarbonate or neutral carbonate of soda and bicarbonate or acid carbonate of soda show evidences of or as chemists say react with alkalinity towards litmus however phenolphthalein though reacting alkaline with monocarbonate of soda indicates the acidity of the bicarbonate of soda a thing which as i have just said litmus will not do we will take two jars containing solution of monocarbonate of soda and in the first we will put some phenolphthalein solution and in the second some litmus tincture the solution in the first jar turns rose coloured and in the second blue indicating in each case that the solution is alkaline if now however carbonic acid be blown into the two solutions that in the first jar containing the phenolphthalein becomes colourless as soon as the monocarbonate of soda is converted into bicarbonate and this disappearance of the rose colour indicates acidity the blue solution in the jar containing litmus on the other hand is not altered by blowing in carbonic acid furthermore if to the colourless solution containing phenolphthalein and which is acid towards that reagent a little reddened litmus is added this is still turned blue and so still indicates the presence of alkali we have therefore in bicarbonate of soda a salt which behaves as an acid to phenolphthalein and as an alkali to litmus another extremely sensitive indicator is the coaltar dyestuff known as congo red the colour changes produced by it are exactly the inverse of those produced in the case of litmus that is it gives a blue colour with acids and a red colour with alkalis we have now learned that acids are as the antipodes to alkalis or bases and that the two may combine to form products which may be neutral or may have a preponderance either of acidity or of basicityin short they may yield neutral acid or basic salts i must try to give you a yet clearer idea of these three classes of salts now acids in general have as we have seen what we may call a chemical appetite and each acid in particular has a specific chemical appetite for bases that is each acid is capable of combining with a definite quantity of an individual base the terms chemical appetite and specific chemical appetite are names i have coined for your present benefit but for which chemists would use the words affinity and valency respectively now some acids have a moderate specific appetite whilst others possess a large one and the same may be said of bases and thus as an example we may have mono di and triacid salts or mono di and tribasic salts in a triacid salt a certain voracity of the base is indicated and in a tribasic salt of the acid again with a base capable of absorbing and combining with its compound atom or molecule several compound atoms or molecules of an acid we have the possibility of partial saturation and perhaps of several degrees of it and also of full saturation which means combination to the full extent of the powers of the base in question also with an acid capable of or possessing a similar large absorptive faculty for bases we have possibilities of the formation of salts of various degrees of basicity according to the smaller or larger degree of satisfaction given to the molecule of such acid by the addition of a base we will now take as a simple case that of hydrochloric acid spirits of salt which is a monobasic acid that is its molecule is capable of combining with only one molecule of a monoacid base hydrochloric acid may be written as its name would indicate hcl and an addition even of excess of such a base as caustic soda written naoh would only yield what is known as common salt or chloride of sodium nacl in which the metal sodium na has replaced the hydrogen h of the hydrochloric acid now chloride of sodium when dissolved in water will turn litmus neither blue nor red it is therefore neutral such simple neutral monobasic salts are mostly very stable by stable we mean they possess considerable resistance to agencies that in the case of other salts effect decompositions of those salts such other salts which are decomposed more or less readily are termed unstable but the terms are of course only comparative now let us consider a di or bibasic acid such an one is vitriol or sulphuric acid h2so4 the hydrogen atoms are in this case an index of the basicity of the acid and accordingly the fully saturated sodium salt is na2so4 or neutral or better normal sulphate of soda in like manner the fully saturated salt of the dibasic acid carbonic acid h2co3 is na2co3 ordinary or normal carbonate of soda but we must observe that with these dibasic acids it is possible by adding insufficient alkali to completely saturate them to obtain salts in which only one hydrogen atom of the acid is replaced by the metal of the base thus sulphuric and carbonic acids yield nahso4 acid sulphate or bisulphate of soda and nahco3 bicarbonate of soda respectively an example of a tribasic acid is phosphoric acid h3po4 and here we may have three different classes of salts of three various degrees of basicity or basesaturation we may have the first step of basicity due to combination with soda nah2po4 or monosodium phosphate the second step na3hpo4 or disodium phosphate and the third and final step na3po4 or trisodium phosphate now let us turn to the varying degrees of acidity or rather the proportions of acid radicals in salts due to the varying appetites or combining powers of bases sodium only forms simple monoacid salts as sodium chloride nacl sodium sulphate na2so4 calcium forms diacid salts eg calcium chloride cacl2 and aluminium and iron triacid salts for example aluminium sulphate al2so43 and iron ferric sulphate fe2so43 now in these triacid salts we can remove some of the acid groups and substitute the elements of water oh or hydroxyl as it is called for them such salts then only partly saturated with acid are termed basic salts thus we have al2oh2so42 al2oh4so4 as well as al2so43 and we can get these basic salts by treating the normal sulphate al2so43 with sufficient caustic soda to remove the necessary quantities of sulphuric acid now it is a curious thing that of these aluminium sulphates the fully saturated one al2so43 is the most stable for even on long boiling of its solution in water it suffers no change but the more basic is the sulphate the less stable it becomes and so the more easily it decomposes on heating or boiling its solution giving a deposit or precipitate of a still more basic sulphate or of hydrated alumina itself al2oh6 until we arrive at the salt al2so42oh2 which is quite unstable on boiling al2so4oh4 would be more unstable still this behaviour may be easily shown experimentally we will dissolve some cake alum or normal sulphate of alumina al2so43 in water and boil some of the solution no deposit or precipitate is produced the salt is stable to another portion of the solution we will add some caustic soda naoh in order to rob the normal sulphate of alumina of some of its sulphuric acid this makes the sulphate of alumina basic and the more basic the more caustic soda is added the sodium na of the caustic soda combining with the so4 of the sulphate of alumina to form sulphate of soda na2so4 whilst the hydroxyl oh of the caustic soda takes the position previously occupied by the so4 but this increase of basicity also means decrease of stability for on boiling the solution which now contains a basic sulphate of alumina a precipitate is formed a result which also follows if more caustic soda is added production of still more basic salts or of hydrated alumina al2oh6 taking place in either case mordanting or fixing acid phenolic coloursbut what has all this to do with mordanting is possibly now the inquiry so much as this that only such unstable salts as i have just described which decompose and yield precipitates by the action on them of alkalis heat the textile fibres themselves or other agencies are suitable to act as true mordants hence generally the sources or root substances of the best and most efficient mordants are the metals of high specific appetite or valency i think we have now got a clue to the principle of mordants and also to the importance of a sound chemical knowledge in dealing most effectively with them and i may tell you that the man who did most to elucidate the theory of mordanting is not a practical man in the general sense of the term but a man of the highest scientific attainments and standing namely professor liechti who with his colleague professor suida did probably more than any other man to clear up much that heretofore was cloudy in this region we have seen that with aluminium sulphate basic salts are precipitated ie salts with such a predominance of appetite for acids or such quasiacids as phenolic substances that if such bodies were present they would combine with the basic parts of those precipitated salts as soon as the latter were formed and all would be precipitated together as one complex compound just such peculiar quasiacid or phenolic substances are alizarin and most of the natural adjective dyestuffs the colouring principles of logwood cochineal persian berries etc hence these substances will be combined and carried down with such precipitated basic salts the complex compounds thus produced are coloured substances known as lakes for example if i take a solution containing basic sulphate of alumina prepared as i have already described and add to some alizarin and then heat the mixture i shall get a red lake of alizarin and alumina precipitated if i had taken sulphate of iron instead of sulphate of alumina and proceeded in a similar manner and added alizarin i should have obtained a dark purple lake now if you imagine these reactions going on in a single fibre of a textile material you have grasped the theory and purpose of mordanting the textile fabric is drawn through the alumina solution to fill the pores and tubes of the fabric it is then passed through a weak alkaline bath to basify or render basic the aluminium salt in the pores and then it is finally carried into the dyebath and heated there in order to precipitate the colour lake in the fibre the method usually employed to mordant woollen fabrics consists in boiling them with weak solutions of the metallic salts used as mordants often with the addition of acid salts cream of tartar and the like a partial decomposition of the metallic salts ensues and it is induced by several conditions 1 the dilution of the liquid 2 the heating of the solution 3 the presence of the fibre which itself tends to cause the breaking up of the metallic salts into less soluble basic ones thus it is not really necessary to use basic aluminium sulphate for mordanting wool since the latter itself decomposes the normal or neutral sulphate of alumina on heating an insoluble basic sulphate being precipitated in the fibres of the wool 4 the presence of other added substances as cream of tartar etc the best alumina mordant is probably the acetate of alumina red liquor and the best iron mordant probably also the acetate iron liquor see preceding lecture because the acetic acid is so harmless to the fibre and is easily driven off on steaming etc a further reason is that from the solution of acetate of iron or alumina basic acetates are very easily precipitated on heating and are thus readily deposited in the fibre mordanting and fixing basic coloursnow let us ask ourselves a very important question suppose we have a colour or dyestuff such as magenta which is of a basic character and not of an acid or phenolic character like the colours alizarin hmatein logwood or carminic acid cochineal and we wish to fix this basic dyestuff on the tissue can we then use red liquor acetate of alumina acetate of iron copperas etc the answer is no for such a process would be like trying to combine base with base instead of base with acid in order to form a salt combination and so precipitation would not take place no lake would be formed we must seek for an acid or acid body to use as mordant for our basic colour and an acid or acid body that will form an insoluble precipitate or colourlake with the dyestuff an acid much used and very valuable for this purpose is tannic acid the tannate of rosaniline colour principle of magenta is a tolerably insoluble lake which can be precipitated by magenta from a solution of tannate of soda the magenta being capable of displacing the soda but tannic acid alone does not form very fast lakes with magenta and the other basic dyestuffs and so a means of rendering these lakes more insoluble is needed it is found that tannic acid and tartar emetic a tartrate of antimony and potash yield a very insoluble compound a tannate of antimony perchloride of tin in a similar manner yields insoluble tannate of tin with tannic acid these insoluble compounds however have sufficient acidaffinity left in the combined tannic acid to unite also with the basic aniline colours forming very fast or insoluble colour lakes this principle is extensively used in practice to fix basic aniline colours especially on cotton we should first soak the piece of cotton in a solution of tannic acid and then pass it into a solution say of tartar emetic when the tannic acid will be firmly fixed as tannate of antimony on the cotton we then dip the mordanted piece of cotton into the colour bath containing for instance magenta and it is dyed a fine red composed of a tannate of antimony and magenta you now see no doubt the necessity of sharply discriminating between two classes of colouring matters which we may term colour acids and colour bases respectively there are but few acids that act like tannic acid in fixing basic aniline dyestuffs but oleic acid and other fatty acids are of the number a curious question might now be asked namely could the acid colour alizarin if fixed on cotton cloth combine with a basic aniline colour eg aniline violet and act as a mordant for it thus fixing it the answer is certainly and thus an alizarin purple would be produced whilst if magenta were used in place of aniline violet an alizarin red of a crimson tone would result chrome mordanting of wool and furin studying this subject i would recommend a careful perusal of the chapter on mordants in jj hummels book entitled the dyeing of textile fabrics and pages 337 to 340 of bowmans work on the woolfibre in the treatment of wool or fur with bichrome potassium bichromate we start with an acid salt a bichromate k2cr2o7 and a strong oxidising agent and we finish with a basic substance namely oxide of chromium in the fibres of the wool or fur if we desire to utilise the whole of the chromic acid in our mordanting liquor we must add to it some sulphuric acid to set free the chromic acid from the potassium with which it is combined bichromate of potash with sulphuric acid gives sulphate of potash and chromic acid the question of the proper exhaustion of bichromate baths is an important economic one now we must remember that this chromic acid cro3 oxidises our wool or fur and must oxidise it before it can of itself act as a mordant by being reduced in the process to hydrated chromic oxide cr2o3 3 h2o 2 cro3 chromic acid cr2o3 chromic oxide o3 oxygen it is this hydrated chromic oxide in the fibre that yields with the hmatein of the logwood your logwood black dye mr jarmain finds that it is not safe to use more than 3 per cent of the weight of the wool of bichromate if 4 per cent be used the colour becomes impaired whilst if 12 per cent be employed the wool cannot be dyed at all with logwood the phenomenon known as overchroming being the result of such excessive treatment i think there is no doubt as professor hummel says that the colouring matter is oxidised and destroyed in such overchroming but i also think that there can be no doubt that the wool itself is also greatly injured and incapacitated for taking up colour now the use of certain coaltar black dyes in place of logwood obviates this use of bichrome and thus the heavy stress on the fibre in mordanting with it it also effects economy in avoiding the use of bichrome as well as of copper salts but even thus of course other problems have to be solved before it can be finally decided which is best lecture ix dyestuffs and colours classificationin classifying the different dyestuffs and colouring matters it is of course necessary to consider first the properties of those colouring matters generally and secondly the particular reason for making such classification the scientific chemist for example would classify them according to theoretical considerations as members of certain typical groups the representative of medical science or hygiene would naturally classify them as poisonous and nonpoisonous bodies whilst the dyer will as naturally seek to arrange them according to their behaviour when applied to textile fabrics but this behaviour on applying to textile fibres if varied in character according to the chemical nature of the colouring matter as well as the chemical and physical nature of the fabricand it is so variedwill make such classification if it is to be thoroughgoing not a very simple matter i may tell you that it is not a simple matter and moreover the best classification and arrangement is that one which depends both on the action of the dyes on the fibres and also on the intrinsic chemical character of the dyestuffs themselves since the higher branches of organic chemistry are involved in the consideration of the structure and dispositions and consequently more or less of the properties of these dyes you will readily comprehend that the thorough appreciation and use of that highest and best method of classification particularly in the case of the coaltar dyes will be more or less a sealed book except to the student of organic chemistry but it may be asked how does that highest and best method of classifying the dyestuffs affect the users the dyers in their processes in reply i would say i believe that the dyer who so understands the chemical principles involved in the processes he carries out and in the best methods of classifying the dyes as chemical substances so as to be able to act independently of the prescriptions and recipes given him by the dye manufacturers and so be master of his own position will ceteris paribus be the most economical and successful dyer many manufacturers of dyestuffs have said the very same thing to me but independently of this i know it and can prove it with the greatest ease let me now by means of an experiment or two prove to you that at least some classification is necessary to begin with so different and varied are the substances used as colouring matters by the dyer both as regards their chemical and physical properties that they even act differently towards the same fibre i will take four pieces of cotton fabric three of them are simple white cotton whilst the fourth cotton piece has had certain metallic salts mixed with thickening substances like gum printed on it in the form of a pattern which at present cannot readily be discerned we will now observe and note the different action on these pieces of cottoni of a turmeric bath ii a magenta bath and iii a madder or alizarin bath the turmeric dyes the cotton a fast yellow the magenta only stains the cotton crimson and on washing with water alone almost every trace of colour is removed again the madder however stains the cotton with no presentable shade of colour at all produces a brownishyellow stain removed at once by a wash in water but let us take the printed piece of cotton and dye that in the alizarin bath and then we shall discover the conditions for producing colours with such a dyestuff as madder or alizarin different coloured stripes are produced and the colours are conditioned by the kind of metallic salts used evidently the way in which the turmeric dyes the cotton is different from that in which the madder dyes it the first is a yellow dyestuff but it would be hard to assign any one shade or tint to alizarin as a dyestuff in fact alizarin the principle of madder is of itself not a dye but it forms with each of several metals a differently coloured compound and thus the metallic salt in the fabric is actually converted into a coloured compound and the fabric is dyed or printed the case is just the same with logwood black dyeing without the presence of iron copperas etc sulphate of copper bluestone or bichrome you would get no black at all we will now try similar experiments with woollen fabrics taking three simple pieces of flannel and also two pieces the one having been first treated with a hot solution of alum and cream of tartar and the other with copperas or sulphate of iron solution and then washed turmeric dyes the first yellow like it did the cotton magenta however permanently dyes the woollen as it did not the cotton alizarin only stains the untreated woollen whilst the piece treated with alumina is dyed red and that with iron purple if however the pieces treated with iron and alumina had been dyed in the magenta solution only one colour would have been the result and that a magentared in each case here we have as proved by our experiments two distinct classes of colouring matters the one class comprises those which are of themselves the actual colour the colour is fully developed in them and to dye a fabric they only require fixing in their unchanged state upon that fabric such dyes are termed monogenetic because they can only generate or yield different shades of but one colour indigo is such a dye and so are magenta aniline black aniline violet picric acid ultramarine blue and so on ultramarine is not it is true confined to blue you can get ultramarine green and even rosecoloured ultramarine but still in the hands of the dyer each shade remains as it came from the colourmaker and so ultramarine is a monogenetic colour monogenetic means capable of generating one turning to the other class which comprises as we have shown alizarin and besides the colouring principle of logwood hmatein gallein and cochineal etc we have bodies usually possessed of some colour it is true but such colour is of no consequence and indeed is of no use to dyers these bodies require a special treatment to bring out or develop the colours for there may be several that each is capable of yielding we may consider them as colourgiving principles and so we term them polygenetic colours polygenetic means capable of generating several or many in the various colours and dyes we have all phases and the monogenetic shades almost imperceptibly into the polygenetic the mode of application of the two classes of colours is of course in each case quite essentially different for in the case of the monogenetic class the idea is mainly either to dye at once and directly upon the unprepared fibre or having subjected the fabric to a previous preparation with a metallic or other solution to fix directly the one colour on that fabric on which without such preparation it would be loose in the case of the polygenetic class the idea is necessarily twofold the dyeing materials are not colours only colour generators hence in all cases the fabric must be prepared with the twofold purposefirst of using a metallic or other agent capable of yielding with the dye material the desired colour and secondly of yielding it on the fibre in an insoluble and permanent form now though i have gone so far into this mode of classification because it does afford some information and light yet i can go no farther without getting into a territory that presupposes a knowledge and acquaintance with the chemical structure of the colouring matters as organic substances which would be at present beyond us i shall now turn to another mode of classification which if not so farreaching as the other is at least an exceedingly useful one the two methods may be combined to a considerable extent by the latter plan the colours may be conveniently divided into three groups i substantive colours ii adjective colours iii mineral and pigment colours substantive dyestuffsthe substantive colours fix themselves readily and directly on animal fibres and substances but only a few amongst them will dye vegetable fibres like cotton and linen directly almost all substantive colours may however be fixed on cotton and linen by first preparing or mordanting those vegetable fibres silk wool fur etc act like fibre and mordant together for they absorb and fix the substantive colours firmly in our experiments we saw that turmeric is one of the few substantive colours fixing itself on both cotton and wool without any aid from a mordant or fixing agent magenta was also a substantive colour but alizarin was certainly not one of this class adjective dyestuffssome of these substances are definitely coloured bodies but in some of them the colour is of no consequence or value and is quite different and distinct from the colour eventually formed on the fibre which colour only appears in conjunction with a special mordant but again some of them are not coloured and would not colour the fibre directly at all only in conjunction with some mordant all the polygenetic colours are of course comprised in this class for example alizarin and logwood hmatein whilst such monogenetic colours as annatto and turmeric are substantive for they will fix themselves without a mordant on cotton and wool the adjective colours can be conveniently subdivided intoa those existing in nature as logwood hmatein and cochineal b those artificially formed from coaltar products as alizarin madder gallein etc mineral and pigment dyestuffsthese colours are insoluble in water and alcohol they are either fixed on the fibre by mechanical means or by precipitation for example you use blacklead or plumbago to colour or darken your hats and you work on this pigment colour by mechanical means i will show you by experiment how to fix a coloured insoluble pigment in the fibre i take a solution of acetate of lead sugar of lead and to it i add some solution of bichrome potassium bichromate acetate of lead soluble in water with bichromate of potash also soluble in water yields on mixing the two acetate of potash soluble in water and chromate of lead or chrome yellow insoluble in water and which is consequently precipitated or deposited now suppose i boil some of that chromeyellow precipitate with limewater i convert that chrome yellow into chrome orange this you see takes place without any reference to textile fibres i will now work a piece of cotton in a lead solution so that the little tubes of the cotton fibre shall be filled with it just as the larger glass tube or vessel was filled in the first experiment i next squeeze and wash the piece so as to remove extraneous solution of lead just as if i had filled my glass tube by roughly dipping it bodily into the lead solution and then washed and cleansed the outside of that tube then i place the fabric in a warm solution of bichromate of potash bichrome when it becomes dyed a chrome yellow for just as chromate of lead is precipitated in the glass tube so it is now precipitated in the little tubes of the cotton fibre see lecture i let us see if we can now change our chrome yellow to chrome orange just as we did in the glass vessel by boiling in limewater i place the yellow fabric in boiling limewater when it is coloured or dyed orange in each little tubular cotton fibre the same change goes on as went on in the glass vessel and as the tube or glass vessel looks orange so does the fabric because the cotton fibres or tubes are filled with the orange chromium compound you see this is quite a different process of pigment colouring from that of rubbing or working a colour mechanically on to the fibre let us now turn to the substantive colours group i and see if we can further subdivide this large group for the sake of convenience we can divide the group into twoa such colours as exist ready formed in nature and chiefly occur in plants of which the following are the most important indigo archil or orchil safflower turmeric and annatto b the very large subgroup of the artificial or coaltar colours we will briefly consider now the dyestuffs mentioned in group a natural substantive coloursindigo one of the most valuable dyes is the product of a large number of plants the most important being different species of indigofera which belong to the pea family none of the plants of which indigofera tinctoria is the chief contain the colouring matter in the free state readymade so to say but only as a peculiar colourless compound called indican first discovered by edward schunck when this body is treated with dilute mineral acids it splits up into indigo blue and a kind of sugar but so easily is this change brought about that if the leaf of the plant be only bruised the decomposition ensues and a blue mark is produced through separation of the indigo blue the possibility of dyeing with indigo so readily and easily is due to the fact that indigo blue absorbs hydrogen from bodies that will yield it and becomes as we say reduced to a body without colour called indigo white a body richer in hydrogen than indigo blue and a body that is soluble if this white body indigo white be exposed to the air the oxygen of the air undoes what the hydrogen did and oxidises that indigo white to insoluble indigo blue textile fabrics dipped in such reduced indigo solutions and afterwards exposed to the air become blue through deposit in the fibres of the insoluble indigo blue and are so dyed this is called the indigovat method we can reduce this indigo so as to prepare the indigovat by simply mixing indigo blue copperas ferrous sulphate solution and milk of lime in a closelystoppered bottle with water and letting the mixture stand the clear liquor only is used a piece of cotton dipped in it and exposed to the air quickly turns blue by absorbing oxygen and is thus dyed the best proportions for the indigovat are for cloth dyeing 4000 parts of water 40 of indigo 60 to 80 of copperas crystals and 50 to 100 of dry slaked lime the usual plan is to put in the water first then add the indigo and copperas which should be dissolved first and finally to add the milk of lime stirring all the time artificial indigo has been made from coaltar products the raw material is a coaltar naphtha called toluene or toluol which is also the raw material for saccharin a sweetening agent made from coaltar this artificial indigo is proving a formidable rival to the natural product orchil paste orchil extract and cudbear are obtained by exposing the plants species of lichens containing the colouring principle called orcin itself a colourless substance to the joint action of ammonia and air when the oxygen of the air changes that orcin by oxidising it into orcin which is the true red colouring matter contained in the preparations named the lichens thus treated acquire gradually a deep purple colour and form the products called cudbear this dye works best in a neutral bath but it will do what not many dyes will namely dye in either a slightly alkaline or slightly acid bath as well orchil is not applicable in cotton dyeing being a substantive colour no mordants are needed in dyeing silk and wool with it the colour produced on wool and silk is a bright magentared with bluish shade litmus is also obtained from the same lichens as yield orchil it is not used in dyeing and is a violetblue colouring matter when neither acid nor alkaline but neutral as it is termed it turns red with only a trace of acid and blue with the least trace of alkali and so forms a very delicate reagent when pieces of paper are soaked with it and dipped into the liquids to be tested safflower this vegetable dyeing material for producing pink colours on cotton without the aid of a mordant consists of the petals of the flower of carthamus tinctorius it contains a principle termed carthamin or carthamic acid which can be separated by exhausting safflower with cold acidulated water sulphuric acid to dissolve out a yellow colouring matter which is useless the residue after washing free from acid is treated with a dilute solution of soda crystals and the liquid is then precipitated by an acid a red precipitate is obtained which fixes itself directly on cotton thread immersed in the liquid and dyes it a delicate rose pink which is unfortunately very fugitive silk can be dyed like cotton the colour is not fast against light turmeric is the root portion of a plant called curcuma tinctoria that grows in southern asia the principle forming the colouring matter is curcumin it is insoluble in cold water not much soluble in hot but easily soluble in alcohol from the latter solution it separates in brilliant yellow crystals although the colour it yields is very fugitive the wool and silk dyers still use it for producing especially olives browns and similar compound shades it produces on cotton and wool a bright yellow colour without the aid of any mordant to show you how easily dyeing with turmeric is effected i will warm some powdered turmeric root in a flask with alcohol and add the extract to a vessel of water warmed to about 140 f 60 c and then dip a piece of cotton in and stir it about when it will soon be permanently dyed a fine bright yellow a piece of wool similarly worked in the bath is also dyed however the unfortunate circumstance is that this colour is fast neither to light nor alkalis contact with soap and water even turns the yellowdyed cotton reddishbrown annatto is a colouring principle obtained from the pulpy matter enclosing the seeds of the fruit of a tree the bixa orellana growing in central and southern america the red or orange colour it yields is fugitive and so its use is limited being chiefly confined to silk dyeing the yellow compound it contains is called orellin and it also contains an orange compound called bixin which is insoluble in water but readily soluble in alkalis and in alcohol with a deep yellow colour to dye cotton with it a solution is made of the colour in a boiling solution of carbonate of soda the cotton is worked in the diluted alkaline solution whilst hot by passing the dyed cotton through water acidulated with a little vitriol or alum a redder tint is assumed for wool and silk pale shades are dyed at 106 f 50 c with the addition of soap to the bath dark shades at 200 to 212 f 80 to 100 c lecture x dyestuffs and colourscontinued artificial substantive dyestuffsyou may remember that in the last lecture we divided the colouring matters as follows i substantive colours fixing themselves directly on animal fibres without a mordant only a few of them doing this however on vegetable fibres like cotton we subdivided them further asa those occurring in nature and b those prepared artificially and chiefly but not entirely the coaltar colouring matters ii adjective colours fixing themselves only in conjunction with a mordant or mordants on animal or vegetable fibres and including all the polygenetic colours iii mineral or pigment colours i described experiments to illustrate what we mean by monogenetic and polygenetic colours and indicating that the monogenetic colours are mainly included in the group of substantive colours whilst the polygenetic colours are mainly included in the adjective colours but i described also an illustration of group iii the mineral or pigment colours by which we may argue that chromate of lead is a polygenetic mineral colour for according to the treatment we were able to obtain either chrome yellow neutral lead chromate or chrome orange basic lead chromate i also said there was a kind of borderland whichever mode of classification be adopted thus for example there are colours that are fixed on the fibre either directly like indigo and so are substantive or they may be and generally are applied with a mordant like the adjective and polygenetic colours examples of these are coerulein alizarin blue and a few more we have now before us a vast territory namely that of the b group of substantive colours or the largest proportion indeed almost all of those prepared from coaltar sources alizarin also prepared from coaltar belongs to the adjective colours with regard to the source of these coaltar colours the word coaltar i was going to say speaks volumes for the destructive and dry distillation of coal in gas retorts at the highest temperatures to yield illuminating gas also yields us tar but coal distilled at lower temperatures as well as shale as in scotland will yield tar but tar of another kind from which colourgenerating substances cannot be obtained practically but instead paraffin oil and paraffin wax for making candles etc coaltar contains a very large number of different substances but only a few of them can be extracted profitably for colourmaking all the useful sources of colours and dyes from coaltar are simply compounds of carbon and hydrogenhydrocarbons as they are called with the exception of one namely phenol or carbolic acid i am not speaking here of those coaltar constituents useful for making dyes but of those actually extracted from coaltar for that purpose ie extracted to profit for example aniline is contained in coaltar but if we depended on the aniline contained ready made in coaltar for our aniline dyes the prices of these dyes would place them beyond our reach would place them amongst diamonds and precious stones in rarity and cost so difficult is it to extract the small quantity of aniline from coaltar the valuable constituents actually extracted are then these benzene toluene xylene naphthalene anthracene and phenol or carbolic acid one ton of lancashire coal when distilled in gas retorts yields about 12 gallons of coaltar let us now learn what those 12 gallons of tar will give us in the shape of hydrocarbons and carbolic acid mentioned as extracted profitably from tar this is shown very clearly in the following table table a the 12 gallons of tar yield 1110 lb of benzene 910 lb of toluene 112 lb of carbolic acid between 110 and 210 lb of xylene 612 lb of naphthalene and 12 lb of anthracene whilst the quantity of pitch left behind is 6912 lb but our table shows us more it indicates to us what the steps are from each raw material to each colouring matter as well as showing us each colouring matter we see here that our benzene yields us an equal weight of aniline and the toluene 910 lb about 34 lb of toluidine the mixture giving on oxidation between 12 and 34 lb of magenta from carbolic acid are obtained both aurin and picric acid and here is the actual quantity of aurin obtainable 114 lb from naphthalene either naphthylamine a body like aniline or naphthol resembling phenol may be prepared the amounts obtainable you see in the table there are two varieties of naphthol called alpha and betanaphthol but only one phenol namely carbolic acid naphthol yellow is of course a naphthol colour whilst vermilline scarlet is a dye containing both naphthylamine and naphthol you see the quantities of these dyes namely 7 lb of scarlet and 912 lb of the naphthol yellow the amount of pure anthracene obtained is 12 lb this pure anthracene exhibits the phenomenon of fluorescence that is it not only looks white but when the light falls on it it seems to reflect a delicate violet or blue light our table shows us that from the 12 gallons of tar from 1 ton of coal we may gain 214 lb of 20 per cent alizarin paste chemically pure alizarin crystallises in brightred needles it is the colouring principle of madder and also of alizarin paste but the most wonderful thing about substantive coaltar colours is their immense tinctorial power ie the very little quantity of each required compared with the immense superficies of cloth it will dye to a full shade table a2 twelve gallons of gastar average of manchester and salford tar yield benzene toluene p solvent h n

lb of coal by a very simple experiment a little of a very fine violet dye can be made from mere traces of the materials one of the raw materials for preparing this violet dye is a substance with a long name which itself was prepared from aniline this substance is tetramethyldiamidobenzophenone and a little bit of it is placed in a small glass testtube just moistened with a couple of drops of another aniline derivative called dimethylaniline and then two drops of a fuming liquid trichloride of phosphorus added on simply warming this mixture the violet dyestuff is produced in about a minute two drops of the mixture will colour a large cylinder of water a beautiful violet the remainder perhaps two drops more will dye a skein of silk a bright full shade of violet here then is a magnificent

ivan levinstein of manchester before we go another step i must ask and answer therefore a few questions can we not get some little insight into the structure and general mode of developing the leading coaltar colours which serve as types of whole series i will try what can be done with the little knowledge of chemistry we have so far accumulated in our earlier lectures we have learnt that water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen and in its compound atom or molecule we have two atoms of hydrogen combined with one of oxygen symbolised as h2o we also learnt that ammonia or spirits of hartshorn is a compound of hydrogen with nitrogen three atoms of hydrogen being combined with one of nitrogen thus nh3 an example of a hydrocarbon or compound of carbon and hydrogen is marsh gas methane or firedamp ch4 nitric acid or aqua fortis is a compound of nitrogen oxygen and hydrogen one atom of the first to three of the second and one of the thirdno3h but this nitric acid question forces me on to a further statement namely we have in this formula or symbol no3h a twofold ideafirst that of the compound as a whole an acid and secondly that it is formed from a substance without acid properties by the addition of water h2o or if we like hoh this substance contains the root or radical of the nitric acid and is no2 which has the power of replacing one of the hydrogen atoms or h of water and so we get instead of hoh no2oh which is nitric acid this is chemical replacement and on such replacement depends our powers of building up not only colours but many other useful and ornamental chemical structures you have all heard the oldfashioned statement that nature abhors a vacuum we had a very practical example of this when in our first lecture on water i brought an electric spark in contact with a mixture of free oxygen and hydrogen in a glass bulb these gases at once united three volumes of them condensing to two volumes and these again to a minute particle of liquid water a vacuum was left in that delicate glass bulb whilst the pressure of the atmosphere was crushing with a force of 15 lb on the square inch on the outside of the bulb and thus a violent crash was the result of natures abhorrence there is such a kind of thing though and of a more subtle sort which we might term a chemical vacuum and it is the result of what we call chemical valency which again might be defined as the specific chemical appetite of each substance let us now take the case of the production of an aniline colour and let us try to discover what aniline is and how formed i pointed to benzene or benzol in the table as a hydrocarbon c6h6 which forms a principal colourproducing constituent of coaltar if you desire to produce chemical appetite in benzene you must rob it of some of its hydrogen thus c6h5 is a group that would exist only for a moment since it has a great appetite for h and we may say this appetite would go the length of at once absorbing either one atom of h hydrogen or of some similar substance or group having a similar appetite suppose now i place some benzene c6h6 in a flask and add some nitric acid which as we said is no2oh on warming the mixture we may say a tendency springs up in that oh of the nitric acid to effect union with an h of the c6h6 benzene to form hoh water when an appetite is at once left to the remainder c6h5on the one hand and the no2on the other satisfied by immediate union of these residues to form a substance c6h6no2 nitrobenzene or essence of mirbane smelling like bitter almonds this is the first step in the formation of aniline i think i have told you that if we treat zinc scraps with water and vitriol or water with potassium we can rob that water of its oxygen and set free the hydrogen it is however a singular fact that if we liberate a quantity of fresh hydrogen amongst our nitrobenzene c6h5no2 that hydrogen tends to combine or evinces an ungovernable appetite for the o2 of that no2 group the tendency being again to form water h2o this of course leaves the residual c6h5n group with an appetite and only the excess of hydrogen present to satisfy it accordingly hydrogen is taken up and we get c6h5nh2 formed which is aniline i told you that ammonia is nh3 and now in aniline we find an ammonia derivative one atom of hydrogen h being replaced by the group c6h5 i will now describe the method of preparation of a small quantity of aniline in order to illustrate what i have tried to explain in theory benzene from coaltar is warmed with nitric acid in a flask a strong action sets in and on adding water the nitrobenzene settles down as a heavy oil and the acid water can be decanted off after washing by decantation with water once or twice and shaking with some powdered marble to neutralise excess of acid the nitrobenzene is brought into contact with fresh hydrogen gas by placing amongst it instead of zinc some tin and instead of vitriol some hydrochloric acid spirits of salt to show you that aniline is formed i will now produce a violet colour with it which only aniline will give this violet colour is produced by adding a very small quantity of the aniline together with some bleaching powder to a mixture of chalk and water the chalk being added for the purpose of destroying acidity this aniline c6h5nh2 is a base and forms the foundation of all the socalled basic aniline colours if i have made myself clear so far i shall be contented it only remains to be said that for making magenta pure aniline will not do what is used being a mixture of aniline with an aniline a step higher prepared from toluene if i were to give you the formula of magenta you would be astonished at its complexity and size but i think now you will see that it is really built up of aniline derivatives methyl violet is a colour we have already referred to and its chemical structure is still more complex but it also is built up of aniline materials and so is a basic aniline colour now it is possible for the colourmaker to prepare a very fine green dye from this beautiful violet methyl violet in fact he may convert the violet into the green colour by heating the first under pressure with a gas called methyl chloride ch3cl methyl violet is constructed of aniline or substituted aniline groups the addition of ch3cl then gives us the methyl green but one of the misfortunes of methyl green is that if the fabric dyed with it be boiled with water at that temperature 212 f the colour is decomposed and injured for some of the methyl chloride in the compound is driven off in fact by stronger heating we may drive off all the methyl chloride and get the original methyl violet back again but we have coaltar colours which are not basic but rather of the nature of acida better term would be phenolic or of the nature of phenol or carbolic acid let us see what phenol or carbolic acid is we saw that water may be formulated hoh and that benzene is c6h6 well carbolic acid or phenol is a derivative of water or a derivative of benzene just as you like and it is formulated c6h5oh you can easily prove this by dropping carbolic acid or phenol down a redhot tube filled with ironborings the oxygen is taken up by the iron to give oxide of iron and benzene is obtained thus c6h5oh gives o and c6h6 but there is another hydrocarbon called naphthalene c10h8 and this forms not one but two phenols as the name of the hydrocarbon is naphthalene however we call these compounds naphthols and one is distinguished as alpha the other as betanaphthol both of them having the formula c10h7oh but now with respect to the colours if we treat phenol with nitric acid under proper conditions we get a yellow dye called picric acid which is trinitrophenol c6h2no23oh you see this is no aniline dye it is not a basic colour for it would saturate ie destroy the basicity of bases again by oxidising phenol with oxalic acid and vitriol we get a colour dyeing silk orange namely aurin hocc6h4oh3 this is also an acid or phenolic dye as a glance at its formula will show you its compound atom bristles so to say with phenolresidues as some of the aniline dyes do with aniline residuegroups we come now to a peculiar but immensely important group of colours known as the azodyes and these can be basic or acid or of mixed kind just suppose two ammonia groups nh3 and nh3 if we rob those nitrogen atoms of their hydrogen atoms we should leave two unsatisfied nitrogen atoms atoms with an exceedingly keen appetite represented in terms of hydrogen atoms as n and n we might suppose a group though of two n atoms partially satisfied by partial union with each other thusnn now this group forms the nucleus of the azocolours and if we satisfy a nitrogen at one side with an aniline and at the other with a phenol or at both ends with anilines and so on we get azodyes produced the number of coaltar colours is thus very great and the variety also adjective coloursas regards the artificial coaltar adjective dyestuffs the principal are alizarin and purpurin these are now almost entirely prepared from coaltar anthracene and madder and garancine are almost things of the past vegetable adjective colours are brazil wood containing the dyegenerating principle brasilin logwood containing hmatein and santalwood camwood and barwood containing santalin animal adjective colours are cochineal and lac dye then of wood colours we have further quercitron persian berries fustic and the tannins or tannic acids comprising extracts barks fruits and gallnuts with also leaves and twigs as with sumac all these colours dye only with mordants mostly forming with certain metallic oxides or basic salts brightlycoloured compounds on the tissues to which they are applied lecture xi dyeing of wool and fur and optical properties of colours you have no doubt a tolerably vivid recollection of the illustrations given in lecture i showing the structure of the fibre of wool and fur we saw that the wool fibre of which fur might be considered a coarser quality possesses a peculiar complex scaly structure the joints reminding one of the appearance of plants of the equisetum family whilst the scaled structure resembles that of the skin of the serpent now you may easily understand that a structure like this if it is to be completely and uniformly permeated by a dye liquor or any other aqueous solution must have those scales not only well opened but well cleansed because if choked with greasy or other foreign matter impervious to or resisting water there can be no chance of the mordanting or dye liquids penetrating uniformly the resulting dye must be of a patchy nature all wool in its natural state contains a certain amount of a peculiar compound almost like a potash soap a kind of soft soap but it also contains besides a kind of fatty substance united with lime and of a more insoluble nature than the first this natural greasy matter is termed yolk or suint and it ought never to be thrown away as it sometimes is by the woolscourers in this country for it contains a substance resembling a fat named cholesterin or cholesterol which is of great therapeutical value water alone will wash out a considerable amount of this greasy matter forming a kind of lather with it but not all as is almost invariably the case after death the matters and secretions which in life favour the growth and development of the parts then commence to do the opposite it is as if the timepiece not merely comes to a standstill but commences to run backwards this natural grease if it be allowed to stand in contact with the wool for some time after shearing instead of nourishing and preserving the fibres as it does on the living animal commences to ferment and injures them by making them hard and brittle we see then the importance of scouring wool for the removal of yolk as it is called dirt oil etc if this important operation were omitted or incompletely carried out each fibre would be more or less covered or varnished with greasy matter resisting the absorption and fixing of mordant and dye as scouring agents ammonia carbonate of ammonia carbonate of soda completely free from caustic and potash or soda soaps especially palmoil soaps which need not be made with bleached palm oil but which must be quite free from free alkali may be used in making these palmoil soaps it is better to err on the side of a little excess of free oil or fat but if more than 1 per cent of free fat be present lathering qualities are then interfered with oleic acid soaps are excellent but are rather expensive for wool they are generally used for silks either as a skin soap or a soap for scouring wools i should prefer one containing about 12 per cent of free fatty matter of course perfectly equally distributed and not due to irregular saponification on the average the soap solution for scouring wool may contain about 612 oz of soap to the gallon of water in order to increase the cleansing powers of the soap solution some ammonia may be added to it however if soap is used for woolscouring one thing must be borne in mind namely that the water used must not be hard for if insoluble lime and magnesia soaps are formed and precipitated on the fibre the scouring will have removed one evil but replaced it by another the principal scouring material used is one of the various forms of commercial carbonate of soda either alone or in conjunction with soap whatever be the form or name under which the carbonate of soda is sold it must be free from hydrate of soda ie caustic soda or as it is also termed causticity by using this carbonate of soda you may dispense with soap and so be able even with a hard or calcareous water to do your woolscouring without anything like the ill effects that follow the use of soap and calcareous water the carbonate of soda solutions ought not to exceed the specific gravity of 1 to 2 twaddell 112 to 3 oz avoird per gallon of water the safest plan is to work with as considerable a degree of dilution and as low a temperature as are consistent with fetching the dirt and grease off the scouring of loose wool as we may now readily discern divides itself into three stages 1st the stage in which those yolk or suint constituents soluble in water are removed by steeping and washing in water this operation is generally carried out by the woolgrower himself for he desires to sell wool and not wool plus yolk or suint and thus he saves himself considerable cost in transport the water used in this process should not be at a higher temperature than 113 f and the apparatus ought to be provided with an agitator 2nd the cleansing or scouring proper with a weak alkaline solution 3rd the rinsing or final washing in water thus far we have proceeded along the same lines as the woollen manufacturer but now we must deviate from that course for he requires softness and delicacy for special purposes for spinning and weaving etc but the felt manufacturer and especially the manufacturer of felt for felt hats requires to sacrifice some of this softness and delicacy in favour of greater felting powers which can only be obtained by raising the scales of the fibres by means of a suitable process such as treatment with acids this process is one which is by no means unfavourable to the dyeing capacities of the wool on the whole it is decidedly favourable so far everything in the treatment of the wool has been perfectly favourable for the subsequent operations of the felthat dyer but now i come to a process which i consider i should be perfectly unwarranted in passing over before proceeding to the dyeing processes in fact were it not for this proofing process see lecture vii the dyeing of felt hats would be as simple and easy of attainment as the ordinary dyeing of wholewool fabrics instead of this however i consider the hat manufacturer as regards his dyeing processes as applied to the stiffer classes of felt hats has difficulties to contend with fully comparable with those which present themselves to the dyer of mixed cotton and woollen or bradford goods you have heard that the purpose of the woolscourer is to remove the dirt grease and socalled yolk filling the pores and varnishing the fibres now the effect of the work of the felt or felthat proofer is to undo nearly all this for the sake of rendering the felt waterproof and stiff the material used also is even more impervious and resisting to the action of aqueous solutions of dyes and mordants than the raw wool would be in short it is impossible to mordant and to dye shellac by any process that will dye wool to give you an idea of what it is necessary to do in order to colour or dye shellac take the case of coloured sealingwax which is mainly composed of shellac four parts and venice turpentine one part to make red sealingwax this mixture is melted and three parts of vermilion an insoluble metallic pigment are stirred in if black sealingwax is required lampblack or ivoryblack is stirred in the fused material is then cast in moulds from which the sticks are removed on cooling that is how shellac may be coloured as sealingwax but it is a totally different method from that by which wool is dyed the difficulty then is thisin proofing your hatforms are rendered impervious to the dye solutions of your dyebaths all except a thin superficial layer which then has to be rubbed down polished and finished thus in a short time since the bulk of that superficially dyed wool or fur on the top of every hat is but small and has been much reduced by polishing and rubbing you soon hear of an appearance of barenessi was going to say threadbarenessmaking itself manifest this is simply because the colour or dye only penetrates a very little way down into the substance of the felt until in fact it meets the proofing which being as it ought to be a waterproofing cannot be dyed it cannot be dyed either by english or german methods neither logwood black nor coaltar blacks can make any really good impression on it cases have often been described to me illustrating the difficulty in preventing hats which have been dyed black with logwood and which are at first a handsome deep black becoming rather too soon of a rusty or brownish shade now my belief is that two causes may be found for this deterioration one is the unscientific method adopted in many works of using the same bath practically for about a month together without complete renewal during this time a large quantity of a muddy precipitate accumulates rich in hydrated oxide of iron or basic iron salts of an insoluble kind this mud amounts to no less than 25 per cent of the weight of the copperas used from time to time carbonate of ammonia is added to the bath as it is said to throw up dirt the stuff or dirt chiefly an ochrelike mass stained black with the dye and rich in iron and carbonate of iron is skimmed off and fresh verdigris and copperas added with another lot of hatforms no doubt on adding fresh copperas further precipitation of iron will take place and so this ochrelike precipitate will accumulate and will eventually come upon the hats like a kind of thin black mud now the effect of this will be that the dyestuff partly in the fibre as a proper dye and not a little on the fibre as if smudged on or painted on will on exposure to the weather moisture air and so on gradually oxidise the great preponderance of iron on the fibre changing to a kind of ironrust corroding the fibres in the process and thus at once accounting for the change to the ugly brownish shade and to the rubbing off and rapid wearing away of the already too thin superficial coating of dyed felt fibre in the final spells of dyeing in the dyebeck already referred to tolerably thick with black precipitate or mud the application of black to the hatforms begins i fear to assume at length a too close analogy to another blacking process closely associated with a pair of brushes and the timehonoured name of day martin with that logwood black fibre anyone could argue as to a considerable proportion of the dye rubbing wearing or washing off thus then we have the second cause of the deterioration of the black for the colour could not go into the fibre and so it was chiefly laid or plastered on you can also see that a logwood black hat dyer may well make the boast and with considerable appearance of truth that for the purposes of the english hat manufacturers logwood black dyeing is the most appropriate ie for the dyeing of highly proofed and stiff goods but as to the permanent character of the black colour on those stiff hats there you have quite another question i firmly believe that in order to get the best results either with logwood black or aniline blacks it is absolutely necessary to have in possession a more scientific and manageable process of proofing such a process is that invented by fw cheetham see lecture vii p 66 in the dyeing of wool and felt with coaltar colours it is in many cases sufficient to add the solution of the colouring matters to the cold or tepid water of the dyebath and after introducing the woollen material to raise the temperature of the bath the bath is generally heated to the boilingpoint and kept there for some time a large number of these coaltar colours show a tendency of going so rapidly and greedily on to the fibre that it is necessary to find means to restrain them this is done by adding a certain amount of glaubers salts sulphate of soda in the solution of which coaltar colours are not so soluble as in water alone and so go more slowly deliberately and thus evenly upon the fibre it is usually also best to dye in a bath slightly acid with sulphuric acid or to add some bisulphate of soda there is another point that needs good heed taking to namely in using different coaltar colours to produce some mixed effect or give some special shade the colours to be so mixed must possess compatibility under like circumstances for example if you want a violet of a very blue shade and you take methyl violet and dissolve it in water and then add aniline blue also in solution you find that precipitation of the colour takes place in flocks a colouring matter which requires as some do to be applied in an acid bath ought not to be applied simultaneously with one that dyes best in a neutral bath numerous descriptions of methods of using coaltar dyestuffs in hatdyeing are available in different volumes of the journal of the society of chemical industry and also tables for the detection of such dyestuffs on the fibre now i will mention a process for dyeing felt a deep dead black with a coaltar black dye which alone would not give a deep pure black but one with a bluishpurple shade to neutralise this purple effect a small quantity of a yellow dyestuff and a trifle of indigotin are added a deep black is thus produced faster to light than logwood black it is stated and one that goes on the fibre with the greatest ease but i have referred to the use of small quantities of differently coloured dyes for the purpose of neutralising or destroying certain shades in the predominating colour now i am conscious that this matter is one that is wrapped in complete mystery and far from the true ken of many of our dyers but the rational treatment of such questions possesses such vast advantages and presupposes a certain knowledge of the theory of colour of application and advantage so equally important that i am persuaded i should not close this course wisely without saying a few words on that subject namely the optical properties of colours colour is merely an impression produced upon the retina and therefore on the brain by various surfaces or media when light falls upon them or passes through them remove the light and colour ceases to exist the colour of a substance does not depend so much on the chemical character of that substance but rather and more directly upon the physical condition of the surface or medium upon which the light falls or through which it passes i can illustrate this easily for example there is a brightred paint known as crookes heatindicating paint if a piece of iron coated with this paint be heated to about 150 f the paint at once turns chocolate brown but it is the same chemical substance for on cooling we get the colour back again and this can be repeated any number of times thus we see that it is the peculiar physical structure of bodies which appear coloured that has a certain effect upon the light and hence it must be from the light itself that colour really emanates originally all colour proceeds from the source of light though it seems to come to the eye from the apparently coloured objects but without some elucidation this statement would appear as an enigma since it might be urged that the light of the sun as well as that of artificial light is white and not coloured i hope however to show you that that light is white because it is so much coloured so variously and evenly coloured though i admit the term coloured here is used in a special sense white light contains and is made up of all the differently coloured rainbow rays which are continually vibrating and whose wavelengths and number of vibrations distinguish them from each other we will take some white light from an electric lantern and throw it on a screen in a prism of glass we have a simple instrument for unravelling those rays and instead of letting them all fall on the same spot and illumine it with a white light it causes them to fall side by side in fact they all fall apart and the prism has actually analysed that light we get now a coloured band similar to that of the rainbow and this band is called the spectrum see fig 16 if we could now run all these coloured rays together again we should simply reproduce white light we can do this by catching the coloured band in another prism when the light now emerging will be found to be white every part of that spectrum consists of homogeneous light ie light that cannot be further split up the way in which the white light is so unravelled by the prism is this as the light passes through the prism its different component coloured rays are variously deflected from their normal course so that on emerging we have each of these coloured rays travelling in its own direction vibrating in its own plane it is well to remember that the bending off or deflection or refraction is towards the thick end of the prism always and that those of the coloured rays in that analysed band the spectrum most bent away from the original line of direction of the white light striking the prism are said to be the most refrangible rays and consequently are situated in the most refrangible end or part of the spectrum namely that farthest from the original direction of the incident white light these most refrangible rays are the violet and we pass on to the least refrangible end the red through bluishviolet blue bluishgreen green greenishyellow yellow and orange if you placed a prism say in the red part of the spectrum and caught some of those red rays and allowed them to pass through your prism and then either looked at the emerging light or let it fall on a white surface you would find only red light would come through only red rays that light has been once analysed and it cannot be further broken up there is great diversity of shades but only a limited number of primary impressions of these primary impressions there are only fourred yellow green and blue together with white and black white is a collective effect whilst black is the antithesis of white and the very negation of colour the first four are called primary colours for no human eye ever detected in them two different colours while all of the other colours contain two or more primary colours if we mix the following tints of the spectrum ie the following rays of coloured light we shall produce white light red and greenishyellow orange and prussian blue yellow and indigo blue greenishyellow and violet all those pairs of colours that unite to produce white are termed complementary colours that is one is complementary to the other thus if in white light you suppress any one coloured strip of rays which mingled uniformly with all the rest of the spectral rays produces the white light then that light no longer remains white but is tinged with some particular tint whatever colour is thus suppressed a particular other tint then pervades the residual light and tinges it that tint which thus makes its appearance is the one which with the colour that was suppressed gave white light and the one is complementary to the other thus white can always be compounded of two tints and these two tints are complementary colours but it is important to remark here that i am now speaking of rays of coloured light proceeding to and striking the eye for a question like this might be asked you say that blue and yellow are complementary colours and together they produce white but if we mix a yellow and a blue paint or dye we have as the result a green colour how is this the cases are entirely different as i shall proceed to show in speaking of the first the complementary colours we speak of pure spectral colours coloured rays of light in the latter of pigment or dye colours as we shall see in the first we have an addition direct of coloured lights producing white in the latter the green colour appearing as the result of the mixture of the blue and yellow pigments is obtained by the subtraction of colours it is due to the absorption by the blue and yellow pigments of all the spectrum practically except the green portion in the case of coloured objects we are then confronted with the fact that these objects appear coloured because of an absorption by the colouring matter of every part of the rays of light falling thereupon except that of the colour of the object which colour is thrown off or reflected this will appear clearer as we proceed now let me point out a further fact and indicate another step which will show you the value of such knowledge as this if properly applied i said that if we selected from the coloured light spectrum separated from white light by a prism say the orange portion and boring a hole in our screen if we caught that orange light in another prism it would emerge as orange light and suffer no further analysis it cannot be resolved into red and yellow as some might have supposed it is monochromatic light ie light purely of one colour but when a mixture of red and yellow light which means of course a mixture of rays of greater and less refrangibility respectively than our spectral orange the monochromatic orangeis allowed to strike the eye then we have again the impression of orange how are we to distinguish a pure and monochromatic orange colour from a colour produced by a mixture of red and yellow in short how are we to distinguish whether colours are homogeneous or mixed the answer is that this can only be done by the prism apart from chemical analysis or testing of the substances illustration fig 16 the spectroscope is a convenient prismarrangement such that the analytical effect produced by that prism is looked at through a telescope and the light that falls on the prism is carefully preserved from other light by passing it along a tube after only admitting a small quantity through a regulated slit now all solid and liquid bodies when raised to a white heat give a continuous spectrum one like the prismatic band already described and one not interrupted by any dark lines or bands the rays emitted from the whitehot substance of the sun have to pass before reaching our earth through the suns atmosphere and since the light emitted from any incandescent body is absorbed on passing through the vapour of that substance and since the sun is surrounded by such an atmosphere of the vapours of various metals and substances hence we have on examining the suns spectrum instead of coloured bands or lines only many dark ones amongst them which are called fraunhofers lines ordinary incandescent vapours from highly heated substances give discontinuous spectra ie spectra in which the rays of coloured light are quite limited and they appear in the spectroscope only as lines of the breadth of the slit these are called linespectra and every chemical element possesses in the incandescent gaseous state its own characteristic lines of certain colour and certain refrangibility by means of which that element can be recognised to observe this you place a bunsen burner opposite the slit of the spectroscope and introduce into its colourless flame on the end of a platinum wire a little of a volatile salt of the metal or element to be examined the flame of the lamp itself is often coloured with a distinctiveness that is sufficient for a judgment to be made with the aid of the naked eye alone as to the metal or element present thus soda and its salts give a yellow flame which is absolutely yellow or monochromatic and if you look through your prism or spectroscope at it you do not see a coloured rainbow band or spectrum as with daylight or gaslight but only one yellow double line just where the yellow would have been if the whole spectrum had been represented i think it is now plain that for the sake of observations and exact discrimination it is necessary to map out our spectrum and accordingly in one of the tubes the third the spectroscope is provided with a graduated scale so adjusted that when we look at the spectrum we also see the graduations of the scale and so our spectrum is mapped the lines marked out and named with the large and small letters of the alphabet are certain of the prominent fraunhofers lines see a b c a d etc fig 16 we speak for example of the soda yellowline as coinciding with d of the spectrum these then are spectra produced by luminous bodies the colouring matters and dyes their solutions and the substances dyed with them are not of course luminous but they do convert white light which strikes upon or traverses them into coloured light and that is why they in fact appear either as coloured substances or solutions the explanation of the coloured appearance is that the coloured substances or solutions have the power to absorb from the white light that strikes or traverses them all the rays of the spectrum but those which are of the colour of the substance or solution in question these latter being thrown off or reflected and so striking the eye of the observer take a solution of magenta for example and place a light behind it all the rays of that white light are absorbed except the red ones which pass through and are seen thus the liquid appears red if a dyed piece be taken the light strikes it and if a pure red from that light all the rays but red are absorbed and so red light alone is reflected from its surface but this is not all with a dyed fabric for here the light is not simply reflected light part of it has traversed the upper layers of that coloured body and is then reflected from the interior losing a portion of its coloured rays by absorption this reflected coloured light is always mixed with a certain amount of white light reflected from the actual surface of the body before penetrating its uppermost layer thus if dyed fabrics are examined by the spectroscope the same appearances are generally observed as with the solution of the corresponding colouring matters an absorption spectrum is in each case obtained but the one from the solution is the purer for it does not contain the mixed white light reflected from the surfaces of coloured objects let us now take an example we will take a cylinder glass full of picric acid in water and of a yellow colour now when i pass white light through that solution and examine the emerging light which looks to my naked eye yellow i find by the spectroscope that what has taken place is this the blue part of the spectrum is totally extinguished as far as g and 23 of f that is all then why say you does that liquid look yellow if all the rest of those rays pass through and enter the eye namely the bluegreen with a trifle of blue the green yellow orange and red the reason is this we have already seen that the colours complementary to and so producing white light with red are green and greenishblue or bluishgreen hence these cancel so to say and we only see yellow we do not see a pure yellow then in picric acid but yellow with a considerable amount of white here is a piece of scarlet paper why does it appear scarlet because from the white light falling upon it it practically absorbs all the rays of the spectrum except the red and orange ones and these it reflects if this be so then and we take our spectrum band of perfectly pure colours and pass our strip of scarlet paper along that variously coloured band of light we shall be able to test the truth of several statements i have made as to the nature of colour i have said colour is only an impression and not a reality and that it does not exist apart from light now i can show you more namely that the colour of the socalled coloured object is entirely dependent on the existence in the light of the special coloured rays which it radiates and that this scarlet paper depends on the red light of the spectrum for the existence of its redness on passing the piece of scarlet paper along the coloured band of light it appears red only when in the red portion of the spectrum whilst in the other portions though it is illumined yet it has no colour in fact it looks black hence what i have said is true and moreover that red paper looks red because as you see it absorbs and extinguishes all the rays of the spectrum but the red ones and these it radiates a bright green strip of paper placed in the red has no colour and looks black but transferred to the pure green portion it radiates that at once does not absorb it as it did the red and so the green shines out finely i have told you that sodium salts give to a colourless flame a fine monochromatic or pure yellow colour now if this be so and if all the light available in this world were of such a character then such a colour as blue would be unknown we will now ask ourselves another question we have a new blue colouring matter and we desire to know if we may expect it to be one of the greatest possible brilliancy what spectroscopic conditions ought it to fulfil on examining a solution of it or rather the light passing through a solution of it with the spectroscope we ought to find that all the rays of the spectrum lying between and nearly to h and b fig 16 ie all the bluishviolet blue and bluegreen rays pass through it unchanged unabsorbed whilst all the rest should be completely absorbed in like manner a pure yellow colour would allow all the rays lying between orangered and greenishyellow fig 16 to pass through unchanged but would absorb all the other colours of the spectrum now we come to the for you mostimportant subject of mixtures of colours and their effects let us take the popular case of blue and yellow producing green we have seen that the subjective effect of the mixture of blue and yellow light on the eye is for the latter to lose sense of colour since colour disappears and we get what we term white light in strict analogy to this the objective effect of a pure yellow pigment and a blue is also to destroy colour and so no colour comes from the object to the eye that object appears black now the pure blue colouring matter would not yield a green with the pure yellow colouring matter for if you plot off the two absorption spectra as previously described on to the spectrum fig 16 you will find that all the rays would be absorbed by the mixture and the result would be a black but now suppose a little less pure yellow were taken one containing a little greenishyellow and a trifle of green and also a little orangered on the other side to red then whereas to the eye that yellow might be as good as the first now when mixed with a blue we get a very respectable green but and this is very important although of the most brilliant dyes and colours there are probably no two of these that would so unite to block out all the rays and produce black yet this result can easily and practically be arrived at by using three colouring matters which must be as different as possible from one another thus a combination of a red a yellow and a blue colouring matter when concentrated enough will not let any light pass through it and can thus be used for the production of blacks and this property is made use of in dyeing and now we see why a little yellow dye is added to our coaltar black a purplish shade would else be produced the yellow used is a colour complementary to that purple and it absorbs just those blue and purple rays of the spectrum necessary to illuminate by radiation that purple and vice vers both yellow and purple therefore disappear in like manner had the black been of a greenish shade i should have added croceine orange which on the fabric would absorb just those green and bluish rays of light necessary to radiate from and illumine that greenish part and the greenish part would do the like by the orange rays the effects would be neutralised and all would fall together into black the end index acetone 64 acid boric see boric acid carbolic see phenol colours
