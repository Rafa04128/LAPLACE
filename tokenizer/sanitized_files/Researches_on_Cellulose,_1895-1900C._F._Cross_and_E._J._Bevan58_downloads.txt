reprint of the first in response to a continuous demand for the book the matter consisting as it does largely of records does not call for any revision and as a contribution to the development of theory any particular interest which it has is associated with the date at which it was written the volume which has since appeared is the sequel and aims at an exposition of the subject to date preface this volume which is intended as a supplement to the work which we published in 1895 gives a brief account of researches which have been subsequently published as well as of certain of our own investigations the results of which are now for the first time recorded we have not attempted to give the subjectmatter the form of a connected record the contributions to the study of cellulose which are noticed are spread over a large area are mostly sectional in their aim and the only cohesion which we can give them is that of classifying them according to the plan of our original work their subjectmatter is reproduced in the form of a prcis as much condensed as possible of the more important papers the original title is given in all cases we have endeavoured to reproduce the authors main conclusions and in most cases without comment or criticism specialists will note that the basis of investigation is still in a great measure empirical and of this the most obvious criterion is the confusion attaching to the use of the very word cellulose this is due to various causes one of which is the curious specialisation of the term in germany as the equivalent of wood cellulose the restriction of this general or group term has had an influence even in scientific circles another influence preventing the recognition of the obvious and as we think inevitable basis of classification of the celluloses is the empiricism of the methods of agricultural chemistry which as regards cellulose are so far chiefly concerned with its negative characteristics and the analytical determination of the indigestible residue of fodder plants physiologists again have their own views and methods in dealing with cellulose and have hitherto had but little regard to the work of the chemist in differentiating and classifying the celluloses on a systematic basis there are many sides to the subject and it is only by a sustained effort towards centralisation that the general recognition of a systematic basis can be secured we may we hope usefully direct attention to the conspicuous neglect of the subject in this country to the matter of the present volume excluding our own investigations there are but two contributions from english laboratories we invite the younger generation of students of chemistry to measure the probability of finding a working career in connection with the cellulose industries they will not find this invitation in the treatment accorded to the subject in textbooks and lectures it is probable indeed that the impression produced by their studies is that the industries in coaltar products largely exceed in importance those of which the carbohydrates are the basis whereas the former are quite insignificant by comparison a little reflection will prove that cellulose starch and sugar are of vast industrial moment in the order in which they are mentioned if it is an open question to what extent science follows industry or vice versa it is not open to doubt that scientific men and especially chemists are called in these days to lead and follow where industrial evolution is most active there is ample evidence of activity and great expansion in the cellulose industries especially in those which involve the chemistry of the raw material and the present volume should serve to show that there is rapid advance in the science of the subject hence our appeal to the workers not to neglect those opportunities which belong to the days of small beginnings we have especially to acknowledge the services of mr j f briggs in investigations which are recorded on pp 3440 and pp 125133 of the text contents the matter of this volume may be divided into the following sections page introductiondealing with the subject in general outline 1 section i general chemistry of the typical cotton cellulose 13 ii synthetical derivativessulphocarbonates and esters 27 iii decompositions of cellulose such as throw light on the problem of its constitution 67 iv cellulose group including hemicelluloses and tissue constituents of fungi 97 v furfuroids ie pentosanes and furfuralyielding constituents generally 114 vi the lignocelluloses 125 vii pectic group

work on cellulose there have appeared a large number of publications dealing with special points in the chemistry of cellulose so large has been the contribution of matter that it has been considered opportune to pass it under review and the present volume taking the form of a supplement to the original work is designed to incorporate this new matter and bring the subject as a whole to the level to which it is thereby to be raised some of our critics in reviewing the original work have pronounced it inchoate for this there are some explanations inherent in the matter itself it must be remembered that every special province of the science has its systematic beginning and in that stage of evolution makes a temporary law unto itself in the absence of a dominating theory or generalisation which when adopted gives it an organic connection with the general advance of the science there is no other course than to classify the subjectmatter thus the carbohydrates may be said to have been in the inchoate condition qualified by a certain classification prior to the pioneering investigations of fischer in attacking the already accumulated and so far classified material from the point of view of a dominating theory he found not only that the material fell into systematic order and grew rapidly under the stimulus of fruitful investigation but in turn contributed to the firmer establishment of the theoretical views to which the subject owed its systematic new birth on the other hand every chemist knows that it is only the simpler of the carbohydrates which are so individualised as to be connoted by a particular formula in the stereoisomeric system leaving the monoses there is even a doubt as to the constitution of cane sugar and the elements of uncertainty thicken as we approach the question of the chemical structure of starch this unique product of plant life has a literature of its own and how little of this is fully known to what we may term the average chemist is seen by the methods he will employ for its quantitative estimation in one particular review of our work where we are taken to task for producing an aggravating book inchoate in the highest degree disfigured by an obscurity of diction which must materially diminish its usefulness nature 1897 p 241 the author who is a wellknown and competent critic makes use of the short expression in regard to the more complex carbohydrates above cane sugar higher in the series all is chaos and in reference to starch the subject is still enshrouded in mystery this material complexity is at its maximum with the most complex members of the series which are the celluloses and we think accounts in part for the impatience of our critic obscurity of diction is a personal quantity and we must leave that criticism to the fates we find also that many workers whose publications we notice in this present volume quite ignore the plan of the work though they make use of its matter we think it necessary to restate this plan which we are satisfied is systematic and in fact inevitable cellulose is in the first instance a structure and the anatomical relationships supply a certain basis of classification next it is known to us and is defined by the negative characteristics of resistance to hydrolytic actions and oxidations these are dealt with in the order of their intensity next we have the more positive definition by ultimate products of hydrolysis so far as they are known which discloses more particularly the presence of a greater or less proportion of furfuralyielding groups putting all these together as criteria of function and composition we find they supply common or general dividing lines within which groups of these products are contained the classification is natural and in that sense inevitable and it not only groups the physiological and chemical facts but the industrial also we do not propose to argue the question whether the latter adds any cogency to a scientific scheme we are satisfied that it does and we do not find any necessity to exclude a particular set of phenomena from consideration because they involve commercial factors we have dealt with this classification in the original work p 78 and we discuss its essential basis in the present volume p 28 in connection with the definition of a normal cellulose but the normal cellulose is not the only cellulose any more than a primary alcohol or an aliphatic alcohol are the only alcohols this point is confused or ignored in several of the recent contributions of investigators it will suffice to cite one of these in illustration on p 16 we give an account of an investigation of the several methods of estimating cellulose which is full of valuable and interesting matter the purpose of the authors elaborate comparative study is to decide which has the strongest claims to be regarded as the standard method they appear to have a preference for the method of langeviz that of heating at high temperatures 180 with alkaline hydrates but the investigation shows that as we had definitely stated in our original work p 214 this is subject to large and variable errors the adverse judgment of the authors we may point out is entirely determined on the question of aggregate weight or yield and without reference to the ultimate composition or constitution of the final product none of the available criteria are applied to the product to determine whether it is a cellulose anhydride or a hydrate or a hydrolysed product after these alkalifusion processes the method of chlorination is experimentally reviewed and dismissed for the reason that the product retains furfuralyielding groups which is from our point of view a particular recommendation ie is evidence of the selective action of the chlorine and subsequent hydrolysis upon the lignone group as a matter of fact it is the only method yet available for isolating the cellulose from a lignocellulose by a treatment which is quantitatively to be accounted for in every detail of the reactions it does not yield a normal cellulose and this is the expression which in our opinion the authors should have used it should have been pointed out moreover that as the cellulose is separated from actual condensed combination with the lignone groups it may be expected to be obtained in a hydrated form and also not as a homogeneous substance like the normal cotton cellulose the product is a cellulose of the second group of the classification another point in this investigation which we must criticise is the ultimate selection of the schulze method of prolonged maceration with nitric acid and a chlorate followed by suitable hydrolysis of the noncellulose derivatives to soluble products apart from its exceptional inconvenience rendering it quite impracticable in laboratories which are concerned with the valuation of cellulosic raw materials for industrial purposes the attack of the reagent is complex and illdefined this criticism we would make general by pointing out that such processes quite ignore the specific characteristics of the noncellulose components of the compound celluloses the second division of the plan of our work was to define these constituents by bringing together all that had been established concerning them these groups are widely divergent in chemical character as are the compound celluloses in function in the plant consequently there is for each a special method of attack and it is a reversion to pure empiricism to expect any one treatment to act equally on the pectocelluloses lignocelluloses and cutocelluloses processes of isolating cellulose are really more strictly defined as methods of selective and regulated attack of the groups with which they occur combined or mixed a chemist familiar with such types as rhea or ramie pectocellulose jute lignocellulose and raffia cutocellulose knows exactly the specific treatment to apply to each for isolating the cellulose and must view with some surprise the appearance at this date of such universal prescriptions as the process in question the third division of our plan of arrangement comprised the synthetical derivatives of the celluloses the sulphocarbonates first as peculiarly characteristic and then the esters chiefly the acetates benzoates and nitrates to these investigators appear to have devoted but little attention and the contribution of new matter in the present volume is mainly the result of our own researches it will appear from this work that an exhaustive study of the cellulose esters promises to assist very definitely in the study of constitutional problems this brings us to the fourth and to the theoretical chemist the most important aspect of the subject the problem of the actual molecular structure of the celluloses and compound celluloses it is herein we are of opinion that the subject makes a law unto itself if the constitution of starch is shrouded in mystery and can only be vaguely expressed by generalising a complex mass of statistics of its successive hydrolyses we can only still more vaguely guess at the distance which separates us from a mental picture of the cellulose unit we endeavour to show by our later investigations that this problem merges into that of the actual structure of cellulose in the mass it is definitely ascertained that a change in the molecule or reacting unit of a cellulose proportionately affects the structural properties of the derived compounds both sulphocarbonates and esters this is at least an indication that the properties of the visible aggregates are directly related to the actual configuration of the chemical units but it appears that we are barred from the present discussion of such a problem in absence of any theory of the solid state generally but more particularly of those forms of matter which are grouped together as colloids cellulose is distinguished by its inherent constructive functions and these functions take effect in the plastic or colloidal condition of the substance these properties are equally conspicuous in the synthetical derivatives of the compound without reference therefore to further speculations and not deterred by any apparent hopelessness of solving so large a problem it is clear that we have to exhaust this field by exact measurements of all the constants which can be reduced to numerical expression it is most likely that the issue may conflict with some of our current views of the molecular state which are largely drawn from a study of the relatively dissociated forms of matter but such conflicts are only those of enlargement and we anticipate that all chemists look for an enlargement of the molecular horizon precisely in those regions where the forces of celllife manifest themselves the cellulose group has been further differentiated by later investigations the fibrous celluloses of which the typical members receive important industrial applications graduate by insensible stages into the hemicelluloses which may be regarded as a wellestablished subgroup in considering their morphological and functional relationships it is evident that the graduation accords with their structure and the less permanent functions which they fulfil they are aggregates of monoses of the various types chiefly mannose galactose dextrose c so far as they have been investigated closely connected with this group are the constituents of the tissues of fungi the recent researches of winterstein and gilson which are noted in this present volume have established definitely that they contain a nitrogenous group in intimate combination with a carbohydrate complex this group is closely related to chitin yielding glucosamin and acetic acid as products of ultimate hydrolysis special interest attaches to these residues as they are in a sense intermediate products between the great groups of the carbohydrates and proteids e fischer ber 19 1920 and their further investigation by physiological methods may be expected to disclose a genetic connection the lignocelluloses have been further investigated certain new types have been added notably a soluble or pectic form isolated from the juice of the white currant p 152 and the pithlike wood of the schynomene p 135 further researches on the typical fibrous lignocellulose have given us a basis for correcting some of the conclusions recorded in our original work and a study of the esters has thrown some light on the constitution of the complex p 130 of importance also is the identification of the hydroxyfurfurals as constituents of the lignocelluloses generally and the proof that the characteristic colourreactions with phenols phloroglucinol may be ascribed to the presence of these compounds p 116 the pectocelluloses have not been the subject of systematic chemical investigation but the researches of gilson la cristallisation de la cellulose et la composition chimique de la membrane cellulaire vgtale la revue la cellule i ix are an important contribution to the natural history of cellulose especially in relation to the pectic constituents of the parenchymatous celluloses indirectly also the researches of tollens on the pectins have contributed to the subject in correcting some of the views which have had a textbook currency for a long period these are dealt with on p 151 the results establish that the pectins are rather the soluble hydrated form of cellulosic aggregates in which acid groups may be represented but such groups are not to be regarded as essentially characteristic of this class of compounds furfuralyielding substances furfuroidsthis group of plant products has been by later investigations more definitely and exclusively connected with the cellulosesie with the more permanent of plant tissues from the characteristic property of yielding furfural which they have in common with the pentoses they have been assumed to be the anhydrides of these c5 sugars or pentosanes but the direct evidence for this assumption has been shown to be wanting in regard to their origin the indirect evidences which have accumulated all point to their formation in the plant from hexoses of special interest in its bearings on this point is the direct transformation of levulose into furfural derivatives which takes place under the action of condensing agents the most characteristic is that produced by the action of anhydrous hydrobromic acid in presence of ether fenton yielding a brommethyl furfural c6h12o6 4h2o hbr c5h3o2ch2br with a br atom in the methyl group these researches of fentons appear to us to have the most obvious and direct bearings upon the genetic relationships of the plant furfuroids and not only per se to give them their full significance we must recall the later researches of brown and morris which establish that cane sugar is a primary or direct product of assimilation and that starch which had been assumed to be a species of universal matire premire is probably rather a general reserve for the elaborating work of the plant if now the aldose groups tend to pass over into the starch form representing a temporary overflow product of the assimilating energy it would appear that the ketose or levulose groups are preferentially used up in the elaboration of the permanent tissue we must also take into consideration the researches of lobry de bruyn showing the labile functions of the typical co group in both aldoses and hexoses whence we may conclude that in the plantcell the transition from dextrose to levulose is a very simple and often occurring process we ourselves have contributed a link in this chain of evidence connecting the furfuroids of the plant with levulose or other ketohexose we have shown that the hydroxyfurfurals are constituents of the lignocelluloses the proportion present in the free state is small and it is not difficult to show that they are products of breakdown of the lignone groups if we assume that such groups are derived ultimately from levulose we have to account for the detachment of the methyl group this however is not difficult and we need only call to mind that the lignocelluloses are characterised by the presence of methoxy groups and a residue which is directly and easily hydrolysed to acetic acid moreover the condensation need not be assumed to be a simple dehydration with attendant rearrangement it may very well be accompanied or preceded by fixation of oxygen leaving out the hypothetical discussion of minor variations there is a marked convergence of the evidence as to the main facts which establish the general relationships of the furfuroid group this group includes both saturated and unsaturated or condensed compounds the former are constituents of celluloses the latter of the lignone complex of the lignocelluloses the actual production of furfural by boiling with condensing acids is a quantitative measure of only a portion ie certain members of the group the hydroxyfurfurals not being volatile are not measured in this way by secondary reactions they may yield some furfural but as they are highly reactive compounds and most readily condensed they are for the most part converted into complex tarry products hence we have no means as yet of estimating those tissue constituents which yield hydroxyfurfurals also we have no measure of the furfuranerings existing performed in such a condensed complex as lignone but chemists having added in the last few years a large number of facts and welldefined probabilities it is clear that the further investigation of the furfuroid group will take its stand upon a much more adequate basis than heretofore on the view of furfuralyielding being coextensive with pentose or pentosane not only were a number of important facts obscured or misinterpreted but there was a barrenness of suggestion of genetic relationships as the group has been widened very much beyond these limits it is clear that if any group term or designation is to be retained that of furfuroid is neutral in character and equally applicable to saturated substances of such widely divergent chemical character as pentoses hexosones glycuronic acid and perhaps most important of all levulose itself all of which are susceptible of condensation to furfural or furfurane derivatives as well as to those unsaturated compounds constituents of plant tissues which are already furfurane derivatives from the chemical point of view such terms are perhaps superfluous but physiological relationships have a significance of their own and there is a physiological or functional cohesion marking this group which calls for recognition at least for the time and we therefore propose to retain the term furfuroid1 general experimental methodsin the investigation of the cellulose group it is clear that methods of ultimate hydrolysis are of first importance none are so convenient as those which are based on the action of sulphuric acid more or less concentrated h2so43h2o h2so4h2o such methods have been frequently employed in the investigations noted in this volume we notice a common deficiency in the interpretation of the results it appears to be sufficient to isolate and identify a crystalline monose without reference to the yield or proportion to the parent substance to establish some main point in connection with its constitution on the other hand it is clear that in hydrolysing a given cellulosecomplex we ought to aim at complete ie quantitative statistics the hydrolytic transformation of starch to dextrins and maltose has been followed in this way and the methods may serve as a model to which cellulose transformations should be approximated in fact what is very much wanted is a systematic reexamination of the typical celluloses in which all the constants of the terms between the original and the ultimate monose groups shall be determined such constants are similar to those for the starchdextrose series viz opticity and cupric reduction various methods of fractionation are similarly available chiefly the precipitation of the intermediate dextrins by alcohol where the original celluloses are homogeneous we should thus obtain transformation series similarly expressed to those of starch in the case of the celluloses which are mixtures or of complex constitution there are various methods of either fractionating the original or of selectively attacking particular monoses resulting from the transformation by methods which are approximately quantitative a mixture of groups such as we have for instance in jute cellulose could be followed through the several stages of their resolution into monoses to put the matter generally in these colloidal and complex carbohydrates the ordinary physical criteria of molecular weight are wanting therefore we cannot determine the relationship of a given product of decomposition to the parent molecule save by means of a quantitative massproportion physical criteria are only of determining value when associated with such constants as cupric reduction and these again must be referred to some arbitrary initial weight such as for convenience 100 parts of the original instead of adopting these methods without which as a typical case the mechanism of starch conversions could not have been followed we have been content with a purely qualitative study of the analogous series obtainable from the celluloses under the action of sulphuric acid a very important field of investigation lies open especially to those who are generally familiar with the methods of studying starch conversions and we may hope in this direction for a series of valuable contributions to the problem of the actual constitution of the celluloses footnotes 1 in this we are confirmed by other writers see tollens j fr landw 1901 p 27 section i general chemistry of the typical cotton cellulose p 32 ash constituentsit is frequently asserted that silica has a structural function sui generis in the plant skeleton having a relationship to the cellulosic constituents of the plant distinct from that of the inorganic ash components with which it is associated it should be noted that the matter has been specifically investigated in two directions in berl ber 5 568 a ladenburg and again in 11 822 w lange appear two papers on the nature of plant constituents containing silicon which contain the results of experimental investigations of equisetum speciesdistinguished for their exceptionally high ash with large proportion of silicato determine whether there are any grounds for assuming the existence of siliconorganic compounds in the plant the analogues of carbon compounds the conclusions arrived at are entirely negative in reference to the second assumption that the cuticular tissues of cereal straws of esparto of the bamboo owe their special properties to siliceous components it has been shown by direct experiment upon the former that their rigidity and resistance to water are in no way affected by cultivation in a silicafree medium in other words the structural peculiarities of the gramine in these respects are due to the physical characteristics chiefly of the lignified cells of the hypodermal tissue and to the composition and arrangement of the cells of the cuticle swedish filter papers of modern make are so far freed from inorganic constituents that the weight of the ash may be neglected in nearly all quantitative experiments fresenius ztschr anal chem 1883 241 it represents usually about 11000 mgr per 1 sq cm of area of the paper the form of an ash derived from a fibrous structure is that of the organic original more or less according to its proportion and composition the proportion of natural ash is seldom large enough nor are the components of such character as to give a coherent ash but if in the case of a fibrous structure it is combined or intimately mixed with inorganic compounds deposited within the fibres from solution the latter may be made to yield a perfect skeleton of the fibre after burning off the organic matter it is by such means that the mantles used in the welsbach system of incandescent lighting are prepared a purified cotton fabricor yarnis treated with a concentrated solution of the mixed nitrates of thorium and cerium and after drying the cellulose is burned away a perfect and coherent skeleton of the fabric is obtained composed of the mixed oxides such mantles have fulfilled the requirements of the industry up to the present time but later experiments forecast a notable improvement it has been found that artificial cellulose fibres can be spun with solutions containing considerable proportions of soluble compounds of these oxides such fibres when knitted into mantles and ignited yield an inorganic skeleton of the oxides of homogeneous structure and smooth contour de mare in 1894 and knofler in 1895 patented methods of preparing such cellulose threads containing the salts of thorium and cerium by spinning a collodion containing the latter in solution when finally ignited after being brought into the suitable mantle form there results a structure which proves vastly more durable than the original welsbach mantle the cause of the superiority is thus set forth by v h lewes in a recent publication j soc of arts 1900 p 858 the alteration in physical structure has a most extraordinary effect upon the lightgiving life of the mantle and also on its strength as after burning for a few hundred hours the constant bombardment of the mantle by dust particles drawn up by the rush of air in the chimney causes the formation of silicates on the surface of the mantle owing to silica being present in the air and this seems to affect the welsbach structure far more than it does the clamond type with the result that when burned continuously the welsbach mantle falls to so low a pitch of light emissivity after 500 to 600 hours as to be a mere shadow of its former self giving not more than onethird of its original light whilst the knofler mantle keeps up its lightemitting power to a much greater extent and the lehner fabric is the most remarkable of all two lehner mantles which have now been burning continuously in my laboratory for over 3000 hours give at this moment a brighter light emissivity than most of the welsbachs do in their prime the new developments of the clamond process form as important a step in the history of incandescent gas lighting as the discoveries which gave rise to the original mantles it has further been found that the oxides themselves can be dissolved in the cellulose alkaline sulphocarbonate viscose solution and artificial threads have been spun containing from 25 to 30 pct of the oxides in homogeneous admixture with the cellulose this method has obvious advantages over the collodion method both in regard to the molecular relationship of the oxides to the cellulose and to cheapness of production untersuchungen ber verschiedene bestimmungsmethoden der cellulose h suringar and b tollens ztschr angew chem 1896 no 23 investigation of methods of determining cellulose introductionthis is an exhaustive bibliography of the subject describing also the various methods of cellulose estimation noted in historical sequence first the weende crude fibre method henneberg with modifications of wattenberg holdefleiss and others is dealt with the product of this treatment viz crude fibre is a mixture containing furfuroids and lignone compounds next follows a group of processes which aim at producing a pure cellulose by eliminating lignone constituents for which the merely hydrolytic treatments of the weende method are ineffectual the method of f schulzeprolonged digestion with dilute nitric acid with addition of chloratehas been largely employed though the composition of the product is more or less divergent from a pure cellulose dilute nitric acid at 6080 cross and bevan and a dilute mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids lifschutz have been employed for isolating cellulose from the lignocelluloses hoffmeister modifies the method of schulze by substituting hydrochloric acid for the nitric acid treatment with the halogens associated with alkaline processes of hydrolysis is the basis of the methods of hugo muller bromine water and cross and bevan chlorine gas lastly the authors notice the methods based upon the action of the alkaline hydrates at high temperatures 180 in presence of water lange or of glycerin gabriel the process of heating to 210 with glycerin only hnig yields a very impure and illdefined product for comparative investigation of these processes certain celluloses and cellulosic materials were prepared as follows a rag cellulosea chemical filter paper containing only cotton and linen celluloses was further purified by boiling with dilute acid and dilute alkali after thorough washing it was airdried b wood cellulosepine wood sawdust was treated by digestion for fourteen days with dilute nitric acid with addition of chlorate schulze the mass was washed and digested with alkaline lye 125 pct koh and exhaustively washed treated with dilute acetic acid again washed and finally airdried this product was found to yield 23 pct furfural on distillation with hcl 106 spgr c purified woodpine wood sawdust was treated in succession with dilute alkalis and acids in the cold and with alcohol and ether until exhausted of products soluble in these liquids and reagents in addition to the above the authors have also employed jute fibre and raw cotton wool in their investigations they note that the yield of cellulose is in many cases sensibly lowered by treating the material after drying at the temperature of 100 the material for treatment is therefore weighed in the airdry condition and a similar sample weighed off for drying at 100 for determination of moisture the main results of the experimental investigation are as follows weende process further attacks the purified celluloses as follows wood cellulose losing in weight 89 pct filter paper 675 pct and the latter treated a second time loses a further 45 pct it is clear therefore that the process is of purely empirical value schulzethis process gave a yield of 476 pct cellulose from pine wood the celluloses themselves treated by the process showed losses of 13 pct in weight much less therefore than in the preceding case hnigs method of heating with glycerin to 210 was found to yield products very far removed from cellulose the process may have a certain value in estimations of crude fibre but is dismissed from further consideration in relation to cellulose langethe purpose of the investigation was to test the validity of the statement that the celluloses are not attacked by alkaline hydrates at 180 experiments with pine wood yielded a series of percentages for cellulose varying from 36 to 41 the purified wood gave also variable numbers 44 to 49 per cent it was found possible to limit these variations by altering the conditions in the later stages of isolating the product but further experiments on the celluloses themselves previously isolated by other processes showed that they were profoundly and variably attacked by the lange treatment wood cellulose losing 50 per cent of its weight and filter paper cellulose losing 15 per cent further a specimen of jute yielded 58 per cent of cellulose by this method instead of the normal 78 per cent it was also found that the celluloses isolated by the process when subjected to a second treatment underwent a further large conversion into soluble derivatives and in a third treatment further losses of 510 per cent were obtained the authors attach value notwithstanding to the process which they state to yield an approximately pure cellulose and they describe a modified method embodying the improvements in detail resulting from their investigation gabriels method of heating with a glycerin solution of alkaline hydrate is a combination of hnig and lange an extended investigation showed as in the case of the latter that the celluloses themselves are more or less profoundly attacked by the treatmentfurther that the celluloses isolated from lignocelluloses and other complex raw materials are much less pure than those obtained by the lange process thus notably in regard to furfural yielding constituents the latter yield 12 pct furfural whereas specimens of jute cellulose obtained by the gabriel process were found to yield 9 to 13 pct furfural cross and bevanchlorination process yielded in the hands of the authors results confirming the figures given in cellulose for yield of cellulose investigation of the products for yield of furfural gave 9 pct of this aldehyde showing the presence of celluloses other than the normal type conclusionsthe subjoined table gives the mean numerical results for yield of endproduct or cellulose by the various methods in the case of the celluloses the results are those of the further action of the several processes on the endproduct of a previous process methods f

ideal method those which may be carried out in a reasonably short time are deficient in two directions 1 they yield a cellulose containing more or less oxycellulose 2 the celluloses themselves are attacked under the conditions of treatment and the end product or cellulose merely represents a particular and at the same time variable equilibrium as between the resistance of the cellulose and the attack of the reagents employed this attack being by no means confined to the noncellulose constituents schulzes method appears to give the nearest approximation to the actual cellulose of the raw material p 8 solutions of cellulose1 zinc chlorideto prepare a homogeneous solution of cellulose by means of the neutral chloride a prolonged digestion at or about 100 with the concentrated reagent is required the dissolution of the cellulose is not a simple phenomenon but is attended with hydrolysis and a certain degree of condensation the latter result is evidenced by the formation of furfural the former by the presence of soluble carbohydrates in the solution obtained by diluting the original solution and filtering from the reprecipitated cellulose the authors have observed that in carefully conducted experiments cotton cellulose may be dissolved in the reagent and reprecipitated with a loss of only 1 pct in weight this however is a net result and leaves undetermined the degree

mercerisationnotwithstanding the enormous recent developments in the industrial application of the mercerising reaction there have been no noteworthy contributions to the theoretical aspects of the subject the following abstract gives an outline of the scope of an important technical work on the subject die mercerisation der baumwolle paul gardner berlin 1898 j springer the mercerisation of cotton this monograph of some 150 pages is chiefly devoted to the patent literature of the subject the chemical and physical modifications of the cotton substance under the action of strong alkaline lye were set forth by mercer in 18445 and there has resulted from subsequent investigations but little increase in our knowledge of the fundamental facts the treatment was industrially developed by mercer in certain directions chiefly 1 for preparing webs of cloth required to stand considerable strain and 2 for producing crpon effects by local or topical action of the alkali but the results achieved awakened but a transitory interest and the matter passed into oblivion so much so indeed that a german patent no 30966 was granted in 1884 to the messrs depouilly for crpon effects due to the differential shrinkage of fabrics under mercerisation by processes and treatments long previously described by mercer such effects have had a considerable vogue in recent years but it was not until the discovery of the lustreing effect resulting from the association of the mercerising actions with the condition of strain or tension of the yarn or fabric that the industry in mercerised goods was started on the lines which have led to the present colossal development the merit of this discovery is now generally recognised as belonging to thomas and prevost of crefeld notwithstanding that priority of patent right belongs to the english technologist h a lowe the author critically discusses the grounds of the now celebrated patent controversy arising out of the conflict of the claims of german patent 855641895 of the former and english patent 44521890 of the latter the author concludes that lowes specification undoubtedly describes the lustreing effect of mercerising in much more definite terms than that of thomas and prevost these inventors on the other hand realised the effect industrially which lowe certainly failed to do as evidenced by his allowing the patent to lapse as an explanation of his failure the author suggests that lowe did not sufficiently extend his observations to goods made from egyptian and other longstapled cottons in which class only are the full effects of the added lustre obtained following these original patents are the specifications of a number of inventions which however are of insignificant moment so far as introducing any essential variation of the mercerising treatment the third section of the work describes in detail the various mechanical devices which have been patented for carrying out the treatment on yarn and cloth the fourth section deals with the fundamental facts underlying the process and effects summed up in the term mercerisation these are as follows a although all forms of fibrous celluloses are similarly affected by strong alkaline solutions it is only the egyptian and other longstapled cottonsie the goods made from themwhich under the treatment acquire the special high lustre which ranks as silky goods made from american cottons acquire a certain finish and lustre but the effects are not such as to have an industrial valueie a value proportional to the cost of treatment b the lustre is determined by exposing the goods to strong tension either when under the action of the alkali or subsequently but only when the cellulose is in the special condition of hydration which is the main chemical effect of the mercerising treatment c the degree of tension required is approximately that which opposes the shrinkage in dimensions otherwise determined by the action of the alkali the following table exhibits the variations of shrinkage of egyptian when mercerised without tension under varying conditions as regards the essential factors of the treatmentviz 1 concentration of the

with increased strength of the lye up to a maximum at 35b there is however a relatively slight increase of action with the increase of caustic soda from 3040b 2 for optimum action the temperature should not exceed 1520c 3 the duration of action is of proportionately less influence as the concentration of the lye increases as the maximum effect is attained the action becomes practically instantaneous the only condition affecting it being that of penetrationie actual contact of cellulose and alkali d the question as to whether the process of mercerisation involves chemical as well as physical effects is briefly discussed the author is of opinion that as the degree of lustre obtained varies with the different varieties of cotton the differentiation is occasioned by differences in chemical constitution of these various cottons the influence of the chemical factors is also emphasised by the increased dyeing capacity of the mercerised goods which effect moreover is independent of those conditions of strain or tension under mercerisation which determine lustre it is found in effect that with a varied range of dye stuffs a given shade is produced with from 10 to 30 pct less colouring matter than is required for the ordinary ie unmercerised goods in reference to the constants of strength and elasticity buntrock gives the following results of observations upon a 405 twofold yarn five threads of 50 cm length being taken for each testprometheus 1897 p 690 a the original yarn broke under a load of 1440 grms b after mercerisation without tension the load required was 2420 grms c after mercerisation under strain 1950 grms mercerisation therefore increases the strength of the yarn from 30 to 66 pct the increase being lessened proportionately to the strain accompanying mercerisation elasticity as measured by the extension under the breaking load remains about the same in yarns mercerised under strain but when allowed to shrink under mercerisation there is an increase of 3040 pct over the original the change of form sustained by the individual fibres has been studied by h lange farberzeitung 1898 197198 whose microphotographs of the cotton fibres both in length and crosssection are reproduced in general terms the change is from the flattened riband of the original fibre to a cylindrical tube with much diminished and rounded central canal the effect of strain under mercerisation is chiefly seen in the contour of the surface which is smooth and the obliteration at intervals of the canal hence the increased transparency and more complete reflection of the light from the surface and the consequent approximation to the optical properties of the silk fibre the work concludes with a section devoted to a description of the various practical systems of mercerisation of yarns in general practice in germany and an account of the methods adopted in dyeing the mercerised yarns researches on mercerised cotton a fraenkel and p friedlaender mitt kk techn gew mus wien 1898 326 the authors after investigation are inclined to attribute the lustre of mercerised cotton to the absence of the cuticle which is destroyed and removed in the process partly by the chemical action of the alkali and partly by the stretching at one or other stage of the process the authors have investigated the action of alcoholic solutions of soda also the lustre effects are not obtained unless the action of water is associated in conclusion the authors give the following particulars of breaking strains and elasticity treatment experiments

derivativessulphocarbonates and esters p 25 cellulose sulphocarbonatefurther investigations of the reaction of formation as well as the various reactions of decomposition of the compound have not contributed any essential modification or development of the subject as originally described in the authors first communications a large amount of experimental matter has been accumulated in view of the ultimate contribution of the results to the general theory of colloidal solutions but viscose is a complex product and essentially variable through its pronounced tendency to progressive decomposition with reversion of the cellulose to its insoluble and uncombined condition the solution for this reason does not lend itself to exact measurement of its physical constants such as might elucidate in some measure the progressive molecular aggregation of the cellulose in assuming spontaneously the solid hydrate form reserving the discussion of these points therefore we confine ourselves to recording results which further elucidate special points normal and other celluloseswe may certainly use the sulphocarbonate reaction as a means of defining a normal cellulose as already pointed out cotton cellulose passes quantitatively through the cycle of treatments involved in solution as sulphocarbonate and decomposition of the solution with regeneration as structureless or amorphous cellulose hydrate analysis of this cellulose shows a fall of carbon percentage from 444 to 433 corresponding with a change in composition from c6h10o5 to 4c6h10o5h2o the partial hydrolysis affects the whole molecule and is limited to this effect whereas in the case of celluloses of other types there is a fractionation of the mass a portion undergoing a further hydrolysis to compounds of lower molecular weight and permanently soluble thus in the case of the wood celluloses the percentage recovered from solution as viscose is from 93 to 95 pct it is evident that these celluloses are not homogeneous a similar conclusion results from the presence of furfuralyielding compounds with the observation that the hydrolysis to soluble derivatives mainly affects these derivatives in the empirical characterisation of a normal cellulose therefore we may include the property of quantitative regeneration or recovery from its solution as sulphocarbonate in the use of the word normal as applied to a bleached cotton we have further to show in what respects the sulphocarbonate reaction differentiates the bleached or purified cotton cellulose from the raw product the following experiments may be cited specimens of american and egyptian cottons in the raw state freed from mechanical ie nonfibrous impurities were treated with a mercerising alkali and the alkalicotton subsequently exposed to carbon disulphide the product of reaction was further treated as in the preparation of the ordinary solution but in place of the usual solution structureless and homogeneous it was observed to retain a fibrous character and the fibres though enormously swollen were not broken down by continued vigorous stirring after large dilution the solutions were filtered and the fibres then formed a gelatinous mass on the filters after purification the residue was dried and weighed the american cotton yielded 900 pct and the egyptian 920 pct of its substance in the form of this peculiar modification the experiment was repeated allowing an interval of 24 hours to elapse between the conversion into alkalicotton and exposure of this to the carbon disulphide the quantitative results were identical there are many observations incidental to chemical treatments of cotton fabrics which tend to show that the bleaching process produces other effects than the mere removal of mechanical impurities in the sulphocarbonate reaction the raw cotton in fact behaves exactly as a compound cellulose whether the constitutional difference between raw and bleached cotton thus emphasised is due to the group of components of the raw cotton which are removed in the bleaching process or to internal constitutional changes determined by the bleaching treatments is a question which future investigation must decide the normal sulphocarbonate viscosein the industrial applications of viscose it is important to maintain a certain standard of composition as of the essential physical properties of the solution notably viscosity it may be noted first that with the abovementioned exception the various fibrous celluloses show but slight differences in regard to all the essential features of the reactions involved in the mercerising reaction or alkalicellulose stage it is true the differences are considerable with celluloses of the wood and straw classes there is a considerable conversion into soluble alkalicelluloses if treated with water these are dissolved and on weighing back the cellulose after thorough washing treatment with acid and finally washing and drying it will be found to have lost from 15 to 20 pct in weight the lower grade of celluloses thus dissolved are only in part precipitated in acidifying the alkaline solution on the other hand after conversion into viscose the cellulose when regenerated reaggregates a large proportion of these lower grade celluloses and the final loss is as stated above from 5 to 7 pct only secondly it is found that all the conditions obtaining in the alkalicellulose stage affect the subsequent viscose reaction and the properties of the final solution the most important are obviously the proportion of alkali to cellulose and the length of time they are in contact before being treated with carbon disulphide an excess of alkali beyond the normal proportionviz 2naoh per 1 mol c6h10o5has little influence upon the viscose reaction but lowers the viscosity of the solution of the sulphocarbonate prepared from it but this effect equally follows from addition of alkali to the viscose itself the alkalicellulose changes with age there is a gradual alteration of the molecular structure of the cellulose of which the properties of the viscose when prepared are the best indication there is a progressive loss of viscosity of the solution and a corresponding deterioration in the structural properties of the cellulose when regenerated from itespecially marked in the film form in regard to viscosity the following observations are typical a a viscose of 18 pct cellulose prepared from an alkalicellulose cotton fourteen days old b viscose of 18 pct cellulose from an alkalicellulose cotton three days old c glycerin diluted with 13 vol water a b b c diluted with equal vol water times of flow of equal volumes from 112 321 103 170 narrow orifice in seconds similarly the cellulose in reverting to the solid form from these degraded solutions presents a proportionate loss of cohesion and aggregating power expressed by the inferior strength and elasticity of the products hence in the practical applications of the product where the latter properties are of first importance it is necessary to adopt normal standards such as above indicated and to carefully regulate all the conditions of treatment in each of the two main stages of reaction so that a product of any desired character may be invariably obtained incidentally to these investigations a number of observations have been made on the alkalicellulose cotton after prolonged storage in closed vessels it is well known that starch undergoes hydrolysis in contact with aqueous alkalis of a similar character to that determined by acids bchamp annalen 100 365 the recent researches of lobry de bruyn rec trav chim 14 156 upon the action of alkaline hydrates in aqueous solution on the hexoses have established the important fact of the resulting mobility of the co group and the interchangeable relationships of typical aldoses and ketoses it was therefore not improbable that profound hydrolytic changes should occur in the cellulose molecule when kept for prolonged periods as alkalicellulose we may cite an extreme case a series of products were examined after 1218 months storage they were found to contain only 35 pct soluble carbohydrates these were precipitated by fehlings solution but without reduction on boiling they were therefore of the cellulose type on acidifying with sulphuric acid and distilling traces only of volatile acid were produced it is clear therefore that the change of molecular weight of the cellulose the disaggregation of the undoubtedly large molecule of the original normal cellulosewhich effects are immediately recognised in the viscose reactions of such productsare of such otherwise limited character that they do not affect the constitution of the unit groups we should also conclude that the cellulose type of constitution covers a very wide range of minor variations of molecular weight or aggregation the resistance of the normal cellulose to the action of alkalis under these hydrolysing conditions should be mentioned in conjunction with the observations of lange and the results of the later investigations of tollens on its resistance to fusion with alkaline hydrates at high temperatures 180 the degree of resistance has been established only on the empirical basis of weighing the product recovered from such treatment the product must be investigated by conversion into typical cellulose derivatives before we can pronounce upon the constitutional changes which certainly occur in the process but for the purpose of this discussion it is sufficient to emphasise the extraordinary resistance of the normal cellulose to the action of alkalis and to another of the more significant points of differentiation from starch chemical constants of cellulose sulphocarbonate solutionin investigations of the solutions we make use of various analytical methods which may be briefly described noting any results bearing upon special points total alkalithis constant is determined by titration in the usual way the cellulose ratio c6h10o5 2naoh is within the ordinary error of observation 2 1 by weight a determination of alkali therefore determines the percentage of cellulose cellulose may be regenerated in various waysviz by the action of heat of acids of various oxidising compounds it is purified for weighing by boiling in neutral sulphite of soda 2 pct solution to remove sulphur and in very dilute acids 033 pct hcl to decompose residues of organic sulphur compounds it may also be treated with dilute oxidants after weighing it may be ignited to determine residual inorganic compounds sulphurit has been proved by lindemann and motten bull acad r belg 3 23 827 that the sulphur of sulphocarbonates as well as of sulphocyanides is fully oxidised to so3 by the hypochlorites solutions at ordinary temperatures the method may be adapted as required for any form of the products or byproducts of the viscose reaction to be analysed for total sulphur the sulphur present in the form of dithiocarbonates including the typical cellulose xanthogenic acid is approximately isolated and determined as cs2 by adding a zinc salt in excess and distilling off the carbon disulphide from a water bath from freshly prepared solutions a large proportion of the disulphide originally interacting with the alkali and cellulose is recovered the result establishing the general conformity of the reaction to that typical of the alcohols on keeping the solutions there is a progressive interaction of the bisulphide and alkali with formation of trithiocarbonates and various sulphides in decomposing these products by acid reagents hydrogen sulphide and free sulphur are formed the estimation of which presents no special difficulties in the spontaneous decomposition of the solution a large proportion of the sulphur resumes the form of the volatile disulphide this is approximately measured by the loss in total sulphur in the following series of determinations in which a viscose of 85 pct strength cellulose was dried down as a thin film upon glass plates and afterwards analysed a proportion of sulphur to cellulose 100 pts in original b after spontaneous drying

fairly constant reaction with normal iodine solution at the first point where the excess of iodine visibly persists there is complete precipitation of the cellulose as the bixanthic sulphide and this occurs when the proportion of iodine added reaches 3i2 4na2o calculated to the total alkali other decompositionsthe most interesting is the interaction which occurs between the cellulose xanthogenate and salts of ammonia which is taken advantage of by c h stearn in his patent process of spinning artificial threads from viscose the insoluble product which is formed in excess of the solution of ammonia salt is free from soda and contains 910 pct total sulphur the product retains its solubility in water for a short period the solution may be regarded as containing the ammonium cellulose xanthate this rapidly decomposes with liberation of ammonia and carbon disulphide and separation of cellulose hydrate as precipitated by ammoniumchloride solution the gelatinous thread contains 15 pct of cellulose with a spgr 11 the process of fixingie decomposing the xanthic residueconsists in a short exposure to the boiling saline solution the further dehydration with increase of gravity and cellulose content is not considerable the thread in its final airdry state has a spgr 148 cellulose benzoatesthese derivatives have been further studied by the authors the conditions for the formation of the monobenzoate c6h9o4ocoph are very similar to those required for the sulphocarbonate reaction the fibrous cellulose cotton treated with a 10 pct solution naoh and subsequently with benzoyl chloride gives about 50 pct of the theoretical yield of monobenzoate converted by 20 pct solution naoh into alkalicellulose and with molecular proportions as below the following yields were obtained

exhaustively treated with cuprammonium solution to which it yielded about 20 pct of its weight which was therefore unattacked cellulose under conditions as above but with 25 mol c6h5cocl a careful comparison was made of the behaviour of the three varieties of cotton which were taken in the unspun condition and previously fully bleached and purified sea island egyptian american aggregate yield

reaction may proceed to a higher limit dibenzoate in the case of egyptian cotton this would necessarily imply a higher limit of mercerisation under equal conditions of treatment with the alkaline hydrate it must be noted that in the conversion of the fibrous cellulose into these still fibrous monobenzoates there are certain mechanical conditions imported by the structural features of the ultimate fibres for the elimination of the influence of this factor a large number of quantitative comparisons will be necessary the above results are therefore only cited as typical of a method of comparative investigation more especially of the still open questions of the cause of the superior effects in mercerisation of certain cottons see p 23 it is quite probable that chemical as well as structural factors cooperate in further differentiating the cottons further investigation of the influence upon the benzoate reaction of increase of concentration of the soda lye used in the preliminary alkali cellulose reaction from 20 to 33 pct naoh established 1 that there is no corresponding increase in the benzoylation and 2 that this ester reaction and the sulphocarbonate reaction are closely parallel in that the degree and limit of reaction are predetermined by the conditions of formation of the alkali cellulose monobenzoate prepared as above described is resistant to all solvents of cellulose and of the cellulose esters and is therefore freed from cellulose by treatment with the former and from the higher benzoate by treatment with the latter several of these notably pyridine phenol and nitrobenzene cause considerable swelling and gelatinisation of the fibres but without solution structureless celluloses of the normal type and insoluble therefore in alkaline lye treated under similar conditions to those described above for the fibrous celluloses yield a higher proportion of dibenzoate the following determinations were made with the cellulose hydrate

maximum of oh groups in cellulose being 4 the reagents were taken in the proportion c6h10o5 4 7 naoh 5 bzcl the yield of crude product after purifying as far as possible from the excess of benzoic acid was 240 pct calculated for dibenzoate 227 pct on further investigating the crude product by treatment with solvents it was found to have still retained benzoic acid there was also present a proportion of only partially attacked cellulose monobenzoate the soluble benzoate amounted to 90 pct of the product it may be generally concluded that the dibenzoate represents the normal maximum but that with the hydrated and partly hydrolysed cellulose molecule as obtained by regeneration from the sulphocarbonate other oh groups may react but they are only a fractional proportion in relation to the unit group c6h10o5 in this respect again there is a close parallelism between the sulphocarbonate and benzoylester reactions the dibenzoate even when prepared from the fibrous celluloses is devoid of structure and its presence in admixture with the fibrous monobenzoate is at once recognised as it constitutes a structureless incrustation under the microscope its presence in however minute proportion is readily observed as stated it is soluble in certain of the ordinary solvents of the cellulose esters eg chloroform acetic acid nitrobenzene pyridine and phenol it is not soluble in ether or alcohol hygroscopic moisture of benzoatesthe crude monobenzoate retains 5055 pct moisture in the airdry condition after removal of the residual cellulose this is reduced to 33 pct under ordinary atmospheric conditions the purified dibenzoates retain 16 pct under similar conditions analysis of benzoateson saponification of these esters with alcoholic sodium hydrate anomalous results are obtained the acid numbers determined by titration in the usual way are 1020 pct in excess of the theoretical the difference increasing with the time of boiling similarly the residual cellulose shows a deficiency of 59 pct it is by no means improbable that in the original ester reaction there is a constitutional change in the cellulose molecule causing it to break down in part under the hydrolysing treatment with formation of acid products this point is under investigation normal results as regards acid numbers on the other hand are obtained by saponification with sodium ethylate in the cold the product being digested with the halfsaturated solution for 12 hours in a closed flask the following results with specimens of mono and dibenzoate purified as far as possible may be cited combustion

especially for the dibenzoate in the case of the hydrogen and yield of cellulose on hydrolysis are noteworthy they confirm the probability of the occurrence of secondary changes in the ester reactions action of nitrating acid upon the benzoatesfrom the benzoates above described mixed nitronitric esters are obtained by the action of the mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids the residual oh groups of the cellulose are esterified and substitution by an no2 group takes place in the aromatic residue giving a mixed nitric nitrobenzoic ester the analysis of the products points to the entrance of 1 no2 group in the benzoyl residue in either case in the cellulose residue 1 oh readily reacts higher degrees of nitration are attained by the process of solution in concentrated nitric acid and precipitation by pouring into sulphuric acid in describing these mixed esters we shall find it necessary to adopt the c12 unit formula in analysing these products we have employed the dumas method for total nitrogen for the ono2 groups we have found the nitrometer and the schloesing methods to give concordant results for the no2 groups it was thought that limprichts method based upon reduction with stannous chloride in acid solution hcl would be available the quantitative results however were only approximate owing to the difficulty of confining the reduction to the no2 groups of the nitrobenzoyl residue by reduction with ammonium sulphide the ono2 groups were entirely removed as in the case of the cellulose nitrates the no2 was reduced to nh2 and there resulted a cellulose amidobenzoate which was diazotised and combined with amines and phenols to form yellow and red colouring matters the reacting residue remaining more or less firmly combined with the cellulose

we have committed ourselves to the statement that on boiling cotton with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate no reaction occurs this is erroneous the error arises however from the somewhat vague statements of schutzenbergers researches which are current in the textbooks eg beilstein 1 ed p 586 together with the statement that reaction only occurs at elevated temperatures 180 as a matter of

oh in the hexoses 5 oh groups reacting the pentose nitrates are comparatively stable at 50 the hexose nitrates on the other hand are extremely unstable showing a loss of weight of 3040 pct when kept 24 hours at this temperature xylose is differentiated by tending to pass into an anhydride form c5h10o5h2o under this esterification when treated in fact with the mixed acids instead of by the process usually adopted by the authors of solution in nitric acid and subsequent addition of the sulphuric acid it is converted into the dinitrate c5h6o2no32 ketoses c6these are sharply differentiated from the corresponding aldoses by giving trinitrates c6h7o2no33 instead of pentanitrates the remaining oh groups probably undergoing internal condensation the products are moreover extremely stable it is also noteworthy that levulose gave this same product the trinitrate of the anhydride levulosan by both methods of nitration supra the bisaccharides or bioses all give the octonitrates the degree of instability is variable canesugar gives a very unstable nitrate the lactose nitrate is more stable thus at 50 it loses only 07 pct in weight in eight days at 75 it loses 1 pct in twentyfour hours but with a rapid increase to 23 pct in fiftyfour hours the maltose octonitrate melts with decomposition at a relatively high temperature 163164 at 5075 it behaves much like the lactose nitrate trisaccharideraffinose yielded the product c18h21o5no311 starch yields the hexanitrate c12 by both methods of nitration the product has a high melting and decomposing point viz 184 and when thoroughly purified is quite stable it is noted that a yield of 157 pct of this nitrate was obtained and under identical conditions cellulose yielded 170 pct wood gum from beech wood gave a tetranitrate c10 formula insoluble in all the usual solvents for this group of esters the authors point out in conclusion that the conditions of instability and decomposition of the nitrates of the monosetriose series are exactly those noted with the cellulose nitrates as directly prepared and freed from residues of the nitrating acids they also lay stress upon the superior stability of the nitrates of the anhydrides especially of the ketoses nitrated carbohydrates as food material for moulds thomas bokorny chem zeit 1896 20 985986 p 38 cellulose trinitrate nitrocellulose will serve as a food supply for moulds when suspended in distilled water containing the requisite mineral matter and placed in the dark the growth is rapid and a considerable quantity of the vegetable growth accumulates round the masses of cellulose nitrate but no growth is observed if mineral matter is absent cellulose itself cannot act as a food supply and it seems probable that if glycerol is present cellulose nitrate is no longer made use of nitration of cellulose hydrocellulose and oxycellulose leo vignon compt rend 1898 126 16581661 p 38 repeated treatment of cellulose hydrocellulose and oxycellulose with a mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids in large excess together with successive analyses of the compounds produced showed that the final product of the reaction corresponded in each case with the fixation of 11 no groups by a molecule containing 24 atoms of carbon on exposure to air nitrohydrocellulose becomes yellow and decomposes nitrooxycellulose is rather more stable whilst nitrocellulose is unaffected the behaviour of these nitroderivatives with schiffs reagent fehlings solution and potash show that all three possess aldehydic characters which are most marked in the case of nitrooxycellulose the latter also when distilled with hydrochloric acid yields a larger proportion of furfuraldehyde than is obtained from nitrocellulose and nitrohydrocellulose cellulose nitratesexplosives p 38 the uses of the cellulose nitrates as a basis for explosives are limited by their fibrous character the conversion of these products into the structureless homogeneous solid or semisolid form has the effect of controlling their combustion the use of nitroglycerin as an agent for this purpose gives the curious result of the admixture of two high or blasting explosives to produce a new explosive capable of extended use for military purposes the leading representatives of this class of propulsive explosives or smokeless powders are ballistite and cordite the technology of which will be found fully discussed in special manuals of the subject since the contribution of these inventions to the development of cellulose chemistry does not go beyond the broad general facts above mentioned we must refer the reader for technical details to the manuals in question there are however other means of arriving at structureless cellulose nitrates one of these has been recently disclosed and as the results involve chemical and technical points of novelty which are dealt with in a scientific communication we reproduce the paper in question viz a reinvestigation of the cellulose nitrates a luck and c f cross j soc chem ind 1900 the startingpoint of these investigations was a study of the nitrates obtained from the structureless cellulose obtained from the sulphocarbonate viscose this cellulose in the form of a fine meal was treated under identical conditions with a sample of pure cotton cellulose viz digested for 24 hours in an acid mixture containing in 100 parts hno324 h2so470 h2o6 the proportion of acid to cellulose being 60 1 after careful purification the products were analysed with the following results soluble in nitrogen ether alcohol fibrous nitrate 1331 43 pct structureless nitrate 1335 56 examined by the heat test at 80 and the stability test at 135 they exhibited the usual instability and in equal degrees nor were the tests affected by exhaustive treatment with ether benzene and alcohol from this it appears that the process of solution as sulphocarbonate and regeneration of the cellulose though it eliminates certain constituents of an ordinary bleached cellulose which might be expected to cause instability has really no effect in this direction it also appears that instability may be due to byproducts of the esterification process derived from the cellulose itself the investigation was then extended to liquids having a direct solvent action on these higher nitrates more especially acetone it was necessary however to avoid this solvent action proper and having observed that dilution with water in increasing proportions produced a graduated succession of physical changes in the fibrous ester we carried out a series of treatments with such diluted acetones quantities of the sample a purified as described but still unstable were treated each with five successive changes of the particular liquid afterwards carefully freed from the acetone and dried at 40c the products which were found to be more or less disintegrated were then tested by the ordinary heat test stability test and explosion test with the results shown in the table on next page in this series of trials the sample a was used in the condition of pulp viz as reduced by the process of wetbeating in a hollander a similar series was carried out with the guncotton in the condition in which it was directly obtained from the ester reaction the results were similar to above fully confirming the progressive character of the stabilisation with increasing proportions of acetone these results prove that washing with the diluted acetone not only rendered the nitrate perfectly stable but that the product was more stable than that obtained by the ordinary process of purification viz longcontinued boiling and washing in water we shall revert to this point after briefly dealing with the associated phenomenon of structural disintegration this begins to be well marked when the proportion of acetone exceeds 80 pct the optimum effect is obtained with mixtures of 90 to 93 acetone and 10 to 7 water by volume in a slightly diluted acetone of such composition the guncotton is instantly attacked the action being quite different from the gelatinisation which precedes solution in the undiluted solvent the fibrous character disappears and the product assumes the form of a free bulky still opaque mass which rapidly sinks to the bottom of the containing vessel the disintegration of the bulk of the nitrate is associated with proportions by volume temperature

for the most part is precipitated at the same time that the undissolved but disintegrated and swollen product undergoes further changes in the direction of increase of hardness and density the product being now collected on a filter freed from acetone by washing with water and dried is a hard and dense powder the fineness of which varies according to the attendant conditions of treatment with the main product in certain cases there is found associated a small proportion of nitrate retaining a fibrous character which may be separated by means of a fine sieve on examining such a residue we found it to contain only 56 pct n and as it was insoluble in strong acetone it may be regarded as a low nitrate or a mixture of such with unaltered cellulose confirming this we found that the product passing through the sieve showed an increase of nitrogen to 1343 pct from the 1331 pct in the original tested by the heat test 50 minutes and stability test no fumes after 100 minutes we found the products to have the characteristics previously noticed it is clear therefore that this specifically regulated action of acetone produces the effects a of disintegration and b stabilisation it remains to determine whether the latter effect was due as might be supposed to the actual elimination of a compound or group of compounds present in the original nitrate and to be regarded as the effective cause of instability it is to be noted first that as a result of the treatment with the diluted acetone and further dilution after the specific action is completed collecting the disintegrated product on a filter and washing with water the loss of weight sustained amounts to 3 to 4 pct this loss is due therefore to products remaining dissolved in the filtratethat is to say in the much diluted acetone these filtrates are in fact opalescent from the presence of a portion of nitrate in a colloidal hydrated form on distilling off the acetone a precipitation is determined the precipitates are nitrates of variable composition analysis showing from 9 to 12 pct of nitric nitrogen the filtrate from these precipitates containing only fractional residues of acetone still shows opalescence on longcontinued boiling a further precipitation is determined the filtrates from which are clear it was in this final clear filtrate that the product assumed to cause the instability of the original nitrate would be present the quantity however is relatively so small that we have only been able to obtain and examine it as residue from evaporation to dryness an exhaustive qualitative examination established a number of negative characteristics with the conclusion that the products were not direct derivatives of carbohydrates nor aromatic compounds on the other hand the following positive points resulted although the original diluted acetone extract was neutral to test papers yet the residue was acid in character it contained combined nitric groups fused below 200 giving off acid vapours and afterwards burning with a smoky flame on adding lead acetate to the original clear solution a wellmarked precipitation was determined the lead compounds thus isolated are characteristic they have been obtained in various ways and analysed the composition varies with the character of the solution in which the lead compound is formed thus in the opalescent or milky solutions in which a proportion of cellulose nitrate is held in solution or semisolution by the acetone still present the lead acetate causes a dense coagulation the precipitates dried and analysed showed 1620 pct pbo and 119 pct n it is clear that the cellulose nitrates are associated in these precipitates with the lead salts of the acid compounds in question when the latter are obtained from clear solutions ie in absence of cellulose nitrates they contain 6063 pct pbo and 35 pct n obtained as no in further confirmation of the conclusion from these results viz that the nitrocelluloses with no tendency to combine with pbo are associated with acid products or byproducts of the ester reaction combining with the oxide the lead reagent was allowed to react in the presence of 90 pct acetone water was added the disintegrated mass collected washed with dilute acetic acid and finally with water various estimations of the pbo fixed in this way have given numbers varying from 2 to 25 pct such products are perfectly stable this particular effect of stabilisation appears therefore to depend upon the combination of certain acid products present in ordinary nitrocelluloses with metallic oxides in order to further verify this conclusion standard specimens of cellulose nitrates have been treated with a large number of metallic salts under varying conditions of action it has been finally established 1 that the effects in question are more particularly determined by treatment with salts of lead and zinc and 2 that the simplest method of treatment is that of boiling the cellulose nitrates with dilute aqueous solutions of salts of these metals preferably the acetates the following results may be cited obtained by boiling a purified service guncotton sample c with a 1 pct solution of lead acetate and of zinc acetate respectively after boiling 60 minutes the nitrates were washed free from the soluble metallic salts dried and tested heat test heat test at 80 at 134 original sample c 10 41 treated with lead acetate 67 45 zinc 91 45 in conclusion we may briefly resume the main points arrived at in these investigations causes of instability of cellulose nitratesthe results of our experiments so far as to the causes of instability in cellulose nitrates may be summed up as follows 1 traces of free nitrating acids which can only occur in the finished products through careless manufacture will undoubtedly cause instability indicated strongly by the ordinary heat test at 80 and to a less extent by the heat test at 134 2 other compounds exist in more intimate association with the cellulose nitrates causing instability which cannot be removed by exhaustive washing with either hot or cold water by digestion in cold dilute alkaline solutions such as sodium carbonate or by extracting with ether alcohol benzene c these compounds however are soluble in the solvents of highly nitrated cellulose such as acetone acetic ether pyridine c even when these liquids are so diluted with water or other nonsolvent liquids to such an extent that they have little or no solvent action upon the cellulose nitrate itself these solutions containing the bodies causing instability are neutral to test paper but become acid upon evaporation by heating this probably explains the presence of free acid when guncotton is purified by longcontinued boiling in water without any neutralising agent being present 3 the bodies causing instability are products or byproducts of the original ester reaction acid bodies containing nitroxygroups but otherwise of illdefined characteristics they combine with the oxides of zinc or lead giving insoluble compounds they are precipitated from their solutions in diluted acetone upon the addition of soluble salts of these metals 4 cellulose nitrates are rendered stable either by eliminating these compounds or by combining them with the oxides of lead or zinc whilst still in association with cellulose nitrates 5 even the most perfectly purified nitrocellulose will slowly decompose with formation of unstable acid products by boiling for a long time in water this effect is much more apparent at higher temperatures dense structureless or nonfibrous cellulose nitrates can be industrially prepared 1 by nitrating the amorphous forms of cellulose obtained from its solution as sulphocarbonate viscose the cellulose in this condition reacts with the closest similarity to the original fibrous cellulose the products are similar in composition and properties including that of instability 2 by treating the fibrous cellulose nitrates with liquid solvents of the high nitrate diluted with nonsolvent liquids and more especially water the optimum effect is a specific disintegration or breaking down of their fibrous structure quite distinct from the gelatinisation which precedes solution in the undiluted solvent and occurring within narrow limits of variation in the proportion of the diluting and nonsolvent liquidfor industrial work the most convenient solution to employ is acetone diluted with about 10 pct of water by volume the industrial applications of these results are the basis of english patents 5286 1898 18868 1898 18233 1898 luck and cross this journal 1899 400 787 the structureless guncotton prepared as above described is of quite exceptional character and entirely distinct from the ordinary fibrous nitrate or the nitrate prepared by precipitation from actual solution in an undiluted solvent3 by the process described the nitrate is obtained at a low cost in the form of a very fine dense structureless white powder of great purity and stability entirely free from all mechanical impurities the elimination of these mechanical impurities and also to a very great extent of coloured compounds contained in the fibrous nitrate makes the product also useful in the manufacture of celluloids artificial silk c whilst its very dense form gives it a great advantage over ordinary fibrous guncotton for use in shells and torpedoes and for the manufacture of gelatinised gunpowders c it can be compressed with ease into hard masses and experiments are in progress with a view of producing from it in admixture with retaining ingredients a military explosive manufactured by means of ordinary black gunpowder machinery and processes manufacture of sporting powderthe fact that the fibrous structure of ordinary guncotton or other cellulose nitrate can be completely or partially destroyed by treatment with diluted acetone and without attendant solution constitutes a process of value for the manufacture of sporting powder having a base of cellulose nitrate of any degree of nitration the following is a description of the hardening process soft grains are manufactured from ordinary guncotton or other cellulose nitrate either wholly or in combination with other ingredients the process employed being the usual one of revolving in a drum in the damp state and sifting out the grains of suitable size after drying these grains are then treated with diluted acetone the degree of dilution being fixed according to the hardness and bulk of the finished grain it is desired to produce j soc chem ind 1899 787 owing to the wide limits of dilution and corresponding effect the process allows of the production of either a bulk or a condensed powder we prefer to use about five litres of the liquid to each one kilo of grain operated upon as this quantity allows of the grains being freely suspended in the liquid upon stirring the grains are run into the liquid which is then preferably heated to the boilingpoint for a few minutes whilst the whole is gently stirred under this treatment the grains assume a more or less rounded gelatinous condition according to the strength of the liquid there is however no solution of the guncotton and practically no tendency of the grains to cohere each grain however is acted upon throughout and perfectly equally after a few minutes treatment water is gradually added when the grains rapidly harden they are then freed from acetone and certain impurities by washing with water heating and drying the process is of course carried out in a vessel provided with any means for gentle stirring and heating and with an outlet for carrying off the volatilised solvent which is entirely recovered by condensation the grains parting with the acetone with ease stabilising cellulose nitratesthe process is of especial value in rendering stable and inert the traces of unstable compounds which always remain in cellulose nitrate after the ordinary boiling and washing process it is of greatest value in the manufacture of collodion cotton used for the preparation of gelatinous blasting explosives and all explosives composed of nitroglycerin and cellulose nitrates such mixtures seem peculiarly liable to decomposition if the cellulose nitrate is not of exceptional stability j soc chem ind 1899 787 emploi de la cellulose pour la fabrication de fils

thread of cellulose has received in later years several solutions mechanically all resolve themselves into the preparation of a structureless filtered solution of cellulose or a cellulose derivative and forcing through capillary orifices into some medium which either absorbs or decomposes the solvent the author notes here that the fineness and to a great extent the softness of the product depends upon the dimensions of the capillary orifice and concentration of the solution the technical idea involved in the spinning of artificial fibres is an old one raumur 2 forecast its possibility audemars of lausanne took a patent as early as 1855 3 for transforming nitrocellulose into fine filaments which he called artificial silk the idea took practical shape only when it came to be used in connection with filaments for incandescent lamps in this connection we may mention the names of the patenteesswinburne 4 crookes weston 5 swan 6 and wynne and powell 7 these inventors prepared the way for chardonnets work which has been followed since 1888 with continually increasing success at this date the lustracelluloses known may be divided into four classes 1 artificial silks obtained from the nitrocelluloses 2 lustracellulose made from the solution of cellulose in cuprammonium 3 lustracellulose prepared from the solution of cellulose in chloride of zinc 4 viscose silks by the decomposition of sulphocarbonate of cellulose cross and bevan group 1 the early history of the chardonnet process is discussed and some incidental causes of the earlier failures are dealt with the process having been described in detail in so many publications the reader is referred to these for details see bibliography 1 and 2 3 and 4 the denitrating treatment was introduced in the period 188890 and of course altogether changed the prospects of the industry not only does it remove the high inflammability but adds considerably to softness lustre and general textile quality in table i

at breaking the numbers are taken for thread of 100 deniers 450 metres of 005 grammes 1 denier it must be noted that according to the concentration of the solution and variations in the process of denitration the constants for the yarn are subject to very considerable variation in regard to the manufacture a number of very serious difficulties have been surmounted first instead of drying the nitrated cellulose which often led to fires c it was found better to take it moist from the centrifugal machine in which condition it is dissolved 5 it was next found that with the concentrated collodion the thread could be spun direct into the air and the use of water as a precipitant was thus avoided with regard to denitration which is both a delicate and disagreeable operation none of the agents recommended to substitute the sulphydrates have proved available of these the author mentions ferrous chloride 6 ferrous chloride in alcohol 7 formaldehyde 8 sulphocarbonates the different sulphydrates 9 have very different effects the calcium compound tends to harden and weaken the thread the ammonia compound requires great care and is costly the magnesium compound works rapidly and gives the strongest thread investigations have established the following point in practice it is not necessary to combine the saponification of cellulose ester with complete reduction of the nitric acid split off the latter requires eight molecules of hydrogen sulphide per one molecule tetranitrocellulose but with precautions four molecules suffice it is well known that the denitration is nearly complete traces only of nitric groups surviving their reactions with diphenylamine allow a certain identification of artificial silks of this class various other inventors eg du vivier 10 cadoret 11 lehner 12 have attempted the addition of other substances to modify the thread these have all failed lehner who persisted in his investigations and with success only attained this success however by leaving out all such extraneous matters lehner works with 10 pct solutions chardonnet has continually aimed at higher concentration up to 20 pct lehner has been able very much to reduce his pressures of ejection in consequence chardonnet has had to increase up to pressures of 60 k per cm and higher the latter involves very costly distributing apparatus lehner made next considerable advance by the discovery of the fact that the addition of sulphuric acid to the collodion caused increase of fluidity 13 which lehner attributes to molecular change chardonnet found similar results from the addition of aldehyde and other reagents 14 but not such as to be employed for the more concentrated collodions the author next refers to his discoveries 15 that alcoholic solutions of a number of substances organic and inorganic freely dissolve the lower cellulose nitrates the most satisfactory of these substances is chloride of calcium 16 it is noted that acetate of ammonia causes rapid changes in the solution which appear to be due to a species of hydrolysis the result is sufficiently remarkable to call for further investigation the chloride of calcium it is thought possible produces a direct combination of the alcohol with a reactive group of the nitrocellulose the fluidity of this solution using one mol cacl2 per 1 mol tetranitrate 17 reaches a maximum in half an hours heating at 6070c the fluidity is increased by starting from a cotton which has been previously mercerised after nitration there is no objection to a chlorine bleach chardonnet has found on the other hand that in bleaching before nitration there is a loss of spinning quality in the collodion the author considers that the new collodion can be used entirely in place of the ordinary etheralcohol collodion with regard to the properties of the denitrated products they fix all basic colours without mordant and may be regarded as oxycellulose therefore the density of the thread is from 15 to 155 the thread of 100 deniers shows a mean breaking strain of 120 grammes with an elasticity of 812 pct the cardinal defect of these fibres is their property of combination with water many attempts have been made to confer waterresistance 18 but without success strehlenert has proposed the addition of formaldehyde 19 but this is without result 20 in reference to these effects of hydration the author has made observations on cotton thread of which the following table represents the numerical results breaking strain mean of 20 experiments skein of bleached cotton without treatment 825 skein of bleached cotton without treatment but wetted 942 ditto after conversion into hexanitrate dry 884 the above wetted 828 the cotton denitrated from above dry 529 the cotton denitrated as above and wetted 206 the author considers that other patents which have been taken for spinning nitrocellulose are of little practical account 21 and 22 the same conclusion also applies to the process of langhans who proposes to spin solutions of cellulose in sulphuric acid 23 24 and mixtures of sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid group 2 lustracellulosethread prepared by spinning solutions of cellulose in cuprammonium this product is made by the vereinigte glanzstofffabriken aachen according to a series of patents under the names of h pauly m fremery and urban consortium mulhousien pour la fabrication de fils brillants e bronnert and e bronnert and fremery and urban 1 the first patent in this direction was taken by despeissis in 1890 2 it appears this inventor died shortly after taking the patent 3 the matter was later developed by pauly 4 especially in overcoming the difficulty of preparing a solution of sufficient concentration it is to be noted that paulys patents rest upon a very slender foundation being anticipated in every essential detail by the previous patent of despeissis for this very great care is required especially first the condition of low temperature and secondly a regulated proportion of copper and ammonia to cellulose the solution takes place more rapidly if the cellulose has been previously oxidised such cellulose gives an 8 pct solution and the thread obtained has the character of an oxycellulose specially seen in its dyeing properties the best results are obtained it appears by the preliminary mercerising treatment and placing the alkali cellulose in contact with copper and ammonia all reagents employed in molecular proportions the author notes that the socalled hydrocellulose girard 5 is almost insoluble in cuprammonium as is starch it is rendered soluble by alkali treatment group 3 lustracellulose prepared by spinning a solution of cellulose in concentrated chloride of zinc this solution has been known for a long time and used for making filaments for incandescent lamps the cellulose threads however have very little tenacity this is no doubt due to the conditions necessary for forming the solution the prolonged digestion causing powerful hydrolysis 1 neither the process of wynne and powell 2 nor that of dreaper and tompkins 3 who have endeavoured to bring the matter to a practical issue are calculated to produce a thread taking a place as a textile the author has described in his american patent 4 a method of effecting the solution in the cold viz again by first mercerising the cellulose and washing away the caustic soda this product dissolves in the cold and the solution remains unaltered if kept at low temperature experiments are being continued with these modifications of the process and the author anticipates successful results the modifications having the effect of maintaining the high molecular weight of the cellulose it would appear that these investigations confirm the theory of cross and bevan that the tenacity of a film or thread of structureless regenerated cellulose is directly proportional to the molecular weight of the cellulose ie to its degree of molecular aggregation 5 group 4 viscose silks obtained by spinning solutions of xanthate of cellulose in 1892 cross and bevan patented the preparation of a new and curious compound of cellulose the thiocarbonate 1 2 3 great hopes were based upon this product at the time of its discovery it was expected to yield a considerable industrial and financial profit and also to contribute to the scientific study of cellulose the later patents of c h stearn 4 describe the application of viscose to the spinning of artificial silk the viscose is projected into solutions of chloride of ammonium and washed in a succession of saline solutions to remove the residual sulphur impurities the author remarks that though it has a certain interest to have succeeded in making a thread from this compound and thus adding another to the processes existing for this purpose he is not of opinion that it shows any advance on the lustracellulose 2 and 3 he also considers that the bisulphide of carbon which must be regarded as a noxious compound is a serious bar to the industrial use of the process and for economic work he considers that the regeneration of ammonia from the precipitating liquors is necessary and would be as objectionable as the denitration baths in the collodion process the final product not being on the market he does not pronounce a finally unfavourable opinion the author and the vereinigte glanzstofffabriken after long investigation have decided to make nothing but the lustracellulose 2 and 3 a new factory at niedermorschweiler near mulhouse is projected for this last production bibliography introduction 1 bull de la soc industr de

artificial cellulose threadsso far as the technical elements of the problems involved are discussed and disclosed in the patent literature the first section in fact consists almost exclusively of the several patent specifications in chronological order and ranged under the subsections a the spinning of nitrocellulose collodion b the spinning of other solutions of cellulose c the spinning of solutions of the nitrogenous colloids in the second section the author deals with the physical and chemical proportions of the artificial threads chardonnet silk is stated to have a mean diameter of 35 but with considerable variations from the mean in the individual fibres equally wide variations in form are observed in crosssection the general form is elliptical but the surface is marked by deep stri and the crosssection is therefore of irregular outline this is due to irregular conditions of evaporation of the solvents the thread being spun into the air from cylindrical orifices of regulated dimensions chardonnet states that when the collodion is spun into alcohol the resultant thread is a perfect cylinder compt rend 1889 108 962 the strength of the fibre is variously stated at from 5080

closest similarity to the chardonnet product in crosssection it is seen to be more regular in outline and a round pseudotubular form prevails due to the conditions of shrinkage and collapse of the fibre in parting with the solvents and in then dehydrating the constants for breaking strain both in the original and moistened condition for elasticity c are closely approximate to those for the

cellulose g bumcke und r wolffenstein berl ber 1899 2493 p 54 theoretical prefacethe purpose of these investigations is the closer characterisation of the products known as oxycellulose and hydracellulose which are empirical aggregates obtained by various processes of oxidation and hydrolysis these processes act concurrently in the production of the oxycelluloses the action of hydrogen peroxide was specially investigated an oxycellulose resulted possessing strongly marked aldehydic characteristics the authors commit themselves to an explanation of this paradoxical result ie the production of a body of strongly reducing properties by the action of an oxidising agent upon the inert cellulose molecule aggregate as due to the hydrolytic action of the peroxide following wurster ber 22 145 who similarly explained the production of reducing sugars from cane sugar by the action of the peroxide the product in question is accordingly termed hydralcellulose by the action of alkalis this is resolved into two bodies of alcoholic cellulose and acid acid cellulose characteristics respectively the latter in drying passes into a lactone the acid product is also obtained from cellulose by the action of alkaline lye boiling 30 pct naoh and by solution in schweizers reagent it is considered probable that the cellulose nitrates are hydrocellulose derivatives and experimental

formed the absence of methane from the products of fermentation is remarkable but the formation of this gas seems to be due to a special organism readily distinguishable from the ferment that produces the fatty acids this organism is at present under investigation p 75 constitution of celluloseit may be fairly premised that the problem of the constitution of cellulose cannot be solved independently of that of molecular aggregation we find in effect that the structural properties of cellulose and its derivatives are directly connected with their constitution so far we have only a superficial perception of this correlation we know that a fibrous cellulose treated with acids or alkalis in such a way that only hydrolytic changes can take place is converted into a variety of forms of very different structural characteristics and these products while still preserving the main chemical characteristics of the original show when converted into derivatives by simple synthesis eg esters and sulphocarbonates a corresponding differentiation of the physical properties of these derivatives from the normal standard and therefore that the new reacting unit determines a new physical aggregate thus the sulphocarbonate of a hydrocellulose is formed with lower proportions of alkaline hydrate and carbon disulphide gives solutions of relatively low viscosity and when decomposed to give a film or thread of the regenerated cellulose these are found to be deficient in strength and elasticity similarly with the acetate the normal acetate gives solutions of high viscosity films of considerable tenacity and when those are saponified the cellulose is regenerated as an unbroken film the acetates of hydrolysed celluloses manifest a retrogradation in structural and physical properties proportioned to the degree of hydrolysis of the original we may take this opportunity of pointing out that the celluloses not only suggest with some definiteness the connection of the structural properties of visible aggregatesthat is of matter in the masswith the configuration of the chemical molecule or reacting unit but supply unique material for the actual experimental investigation of the problems involved of all the organic colloids cellulose is the only one which can be converted into a variety of derivative forms from each of which a regular solid can be produced in continuous length and of any prescribed dimensions thus we can compare the structural properties of cellulose with those of its hydrates nitrates acetates and benzoates in terms of measurements of breaking strain extensibility elasticity investigations in this field are being prosecuted but the results are not as yet sufficiently elaborated for reduction to formul one striking general conclusion is however established and that is that the structural properties of cellulose are but little affected by esterification and appear therefore to be a function of the special arrangement of the carbon atoms ie of the molecular constitution also it is established that the molecular aggregate which constitutes a cellulose is of a resistant type and undoubtedly persists in the solutions of the compounds it may be urged that it is superfluous to import these questions of massaggregation into the problem of the chemical constitution of cellulose but we shall find that the point again arises in attempting to define the reacting unit which is another term for the molecule in the majority of cases we rely for this upon physical measurements and in fact the purely chemical determination of such quantities is inferential attempts have been made to determine the molecular weights of the cellulose esters in solution by observations of depression of solidifying and boilingpoints but the numbers have little value the only other welldefined compound is the sulphocarbonate it has been pointed out that by successive precipitations of this compound there occurs a continual aggregation of the cellulose with dissociation of the alkali and cs residues and it has been found impossible to assign a limit to the dissociation ie to fix a point at which the transition from soluble sulphocarbonate to insoluble cellulose takes place on these grounds it will be seen we are reduced to a somewhat speculative treatment of the hypothetical ultimate unit group which is taken as of c6 dimensions as there has been no addition of experimental facts directly contributing to the solution of the problem the material available for a discussion of the probabilities remains very much as stated in the first edition pp 7577 it is now generally admitted that the tetracetate n c6h6ooac4 is a normal cellulose ester therefore that four of the five o atoms are hydroxylic the fifth is undoubtedly carbonyl oxygen the reactions of cellulose certainly indicate that the co group is ketonic rather than aldehydic even when attacked by strong sulphuric acid the resolution proceeds some considerable way before products are obtained reducing fehlings solution this is not easily reconcilable with any polyaldose formula nor is the resistance of cellulose to very severe alkaline treatments the probability may be noted here that under the action of the alkaline hydrates there occurs a change of configuration lobry de bruyns researches on the change of position of the typical co group of the simple hexoses in presence of alkalis point very definitely in this direction it is probable that in the formation of alkali cellulose there is a constitutional change of the cellulose which may in effect be due to a migration of a co position within the unit group again also we have the interesting fact that structural changes accompany the chemical reaction it is surprising that there should have been no investigation of these changes of external form and structure otherwise than as mass effects we cannot therefore say what may be the molecular interpretation of these effects it has not yet been determined whether there are any intrinsic volume changes in the cellulose substance itself and as regards what changes are determined in the reacting unit or molecule we can only note a fruitful subject for future investigation a priori our views of the probable changes depend upon the assumed constitution of the unit group if of the ordinary carbohydrate type formulated with an open chain there is little to surmise beyond the change of position of a co group but alternative formul have been proposed thus the tetracetate is a derivative to be reckoned with in the problem it is formed under conditions which preclude constitutional changes within the unit groups the temperature of the main reaction is 3040 the reagents are used but little in excess of the quantitative proportions and the yields are approximately quantitative if now the derivative is formed entirely without the hydrolysis the empirical formula c6h6ooac4 justifies a closedring formula for the original viz cochoh4ch2 and the preference for this formula depends upon the explanation it affords of the aggregation of the groups by way of coch2 synthesis the exact relationship of the tetracetate to the original cellulose is somewhat difficult to determine the startingpoint is a cellulose hydrate since it is the product obtained by decomposition of the sulphocarbonate the degree of hydrolysis attending the cycle of reactions is indicated by the formula 4 c6h10o5h2o it has been already shown that this degree of hydrolysis does not produce molecular disaggregation if this hydrate survived the acetylation it would of course affect the empirical composition ie chiefly the carbon percentage of the product it may be here pointed out that the extreme variation of the carbon in this group of carbohydrate esters is as between c14h20o10 c 483 pct and c14h18o9 c 508 pct ie a tetracetate of c6h12o6 and c6h10o5 respectively in the fractional intermediate terms it is clear that we come within the range of ordinary experimental errors and to solve this critical point by way of ultimate analysis must involve an extended series of analyses with precautions for specially minimising and quantifying the error the determination of the acetyl by saponification is also subject to an error sufficiently large to preclude the results being applied to solve the point while therefore we must defer the final statement as to whether the tetracetate is produced from or contains a partly hydrolysed cellulose molecule it is clear that at least a large proportion of the unit groups must be acetylated in the proportion c6h6ooac4 it has been shown that by the method of franchimont a higher proportion of acetyl groups can be introduced but this result involves a destructive hydrolysis of the cellulose the acetates are not derivatives of cellulose but of products of hydrolytic decomposition it appears therefore that with the normal limit of acetylation at the tetracetate the aggregation of the unit groups must depend upon the co groups and a ring formula of the general form cochoh4ch2 is consistent with the facts vignon has proposed for cellulose the constitutional formula och o choh3 ch2ch with reference to the highest nitrate and the decomposition of the nitrate by alkalis with formation of hydroxypyruvic acid while these reactions afford no very sure ground for deductions as to constitutional relationships it certainly appears that if the aldose view of the unit group is to be retained this form of the anhydride contains suggestions of the general tendency of the celluloses on treatment with condensing acids to split off formic acid in relatively large quantity ber 1895 1940 the condensation of the oxycelluloses to furfural the nonformation of the normal hydroxydicarboxylic acids by nitric acid oxidations indirectly we may point out that any hypothesis which retains the polyaldose view of cellulose and so fails to differentiate its constitution from that of starch has little promise of progress the above formula moreover concerns the assumed unit group with no suggestion as to the mode of aggregation in the cellulose complex also there is no suggestion as to how far the formula is applicable to the celluloses considered as a group in extending this view to the oxycelluloses vignon introduces the derived oxidised group chochoh3ch co o of which one is apportioned to three or four groups of the cellulose previously formulated these groups in condensed union together constitute an oxycellulose these views are in agreement with the experimental results obtained by faber and tollens p 71 they regard the oxycelluloses as compounds of celloxin c6h8o6 with 14 mols unaltered cellulose and the former they particularly refer to as a lactone of glycuronic acid but on boiling with lime they obtain dioxybutyric and isosaccharinic acids both of which are not very obviously related to the compounds formulated by vignon we revert with preference to a definitely ketonic formula for which moreover some farther grounds remain to be mentioned in the systematic investigation of the nitric esters of the carbohydrates p 41 will and lenze have definitely differentiated the ketoses from the aldoses as showing an internal condensation accompanying the ester reaction not only are the oh groups taking part in the latter consequently less by two than in the corresponding aldoses but the nitrates show a much increased stability this would give a simple explanation of the wellknown facts obtaining in the corresponding esters of the normal cellulose we may note here that an important item in the quantitative factors of the cellulose nitric ester reaction has been overlooked that is the yield calculated to the no3 groups fixed the theoretical yields for the higher nitrates are yield pct n pct of cellulose of nitrate pentanitrate 169 127 hexanitrate 183 141 from such statistics as are recorded the yields are not in accordance with the above there is a sensible deficiency thus will and lenze record a yield of 170 pct for a product with 138 pct n indicating a deficiency of about 10 pct as the byproducts soluble in the acid mixture are extremely small the deficiency represents approximately the water split off by an internal reaction in this important point the celluloses behave as ketoses in the lignocelluloses the condensed constituents of the complex are of wellmarked ketonic ie quinonic type in nitrating the lignocelluloses this phenomenon of internal condensation is much more pronounced see p 131 as the reaction is mainly confined to the cellulose of the fibre we have this additional evidence that the typical carbonyl is of ketonic function it is still an open question whether the cellulose constituents of the lignocelluloses are progressively condensedwith progress of lignificationto the unsaturated or lignone groups there is much in favour of this view the evidence being dealt with in the first edition p 180 the transition from a celluloseketone to the lignoneketone involves a simple condensation without rearrangement from which we may argue back to the greater probability of the ketonic structure of the cellulose we must note however that the celluloses of the lignocelluloses are obtained as residues of various reactions and are not homogeneous they yield on boiling with condensing acids from 6 to 9 pct furfural it is usual to regard furfural as invariably produced from a pentose residue but this interpretation ignores a number of other probable sources of the aldehyde it must be particularly remembered that lvulose is readily condensed a to a methylhydroxyfurfural c6h1o6 3h2o c6h6o3 c5ohh2ch3o2 and b by hbr with further loss of oh as under c6h12o6 4h2o hbr c5h3ch2bro and generally the ketoses are distinguished from the aldoses by their susceptibility to condensation such condensation of lvulose has been effected by two methods a by heating the concentrated aqueous solution with a small proportion of oxalic acid at 3 atm pressure kiermayer chem ztg 19 100 b by the action of hydrobromic acid gas in presence of anhydrous ether the actual compound obtained being the omegabrommethyl derivative fenton j chem soc 1899 423 this latter method is being extended to the investigation of typical celluloses and the results appear to confirm the view that cellulose may be of ketonic constitution the evidence which is obtainable from the synthetical side of the question rests of course mainly upon the physiological basis there are two points which may be noted since the researches of brown and morris j chem soc 1893 604 have altered our views of the relationships of starch and cane sugar to the assimilation process and have placed the latter in the position of a primary product with starch as a species of overflow and reserve product it appears that lvulose must play an important part in the elaboration of cellulose moreover a j brown in studying the cellulosic cellcollecting envelope produced by the bacterium xylinum found that the proportion of this product to the carbohydrate disappearing under the action of the ferment was highest in the case of lvulose these facts being also taken into consideration there is a concurrence of suggestion that the typical co group in the celluloses is of ketonic character that the typical cotton cellulose breaks down finally under the action of sulphuric acid to dextrose cannot be held to prove the aldehydic position of the carbonyls in the unit groups of the actual cellulose molecule or aggregate we again are confronted with the problem of the aggregate and as to how far it may affect the constitution of the unit groups that it modifies the functions or reactivity of the ultimate constituent groups we have seen from the study of the esters thus with the direct ester reactions the normal fibrous cellulose c6h16o5 yields a monoacetate dibenzoate and a trinitrate respectively under conditions which determine with the simple hexoses and anhydrides the maximum esterification ie all the oh groups reacting if the oh groups are of variable function we should expect the co groups a fortiori to be susceptible of change of function ie of position within the unit groups but as to how far this is a problem of the constitution or phases of constitution of the unit groups or of the aggregate under reaction we have as yet no grounds to determine the subjoined communication appearing after the completion of the ms of the book and belonging to a date subsequent to the period intended to be covered is nevertheless included by reason of its exceptional importance and special bearing on the constitutional problem above discussed the action of hydrogen bromine on carbohydrates4 h j h fenton and mildred gostling j chem soc 1901 361 the authors have shown in a previous communication trans 1898 73 554 that certain classes of carbohydrates when acted upon at the ordinary temperature with dry hydrogen bromide in ethereal solution give an intense and beautiful purple colour5 it was further shown trans 1899 75 423 that this purple substance when neutralised with sodium carbonate and extracted with ether yields goldenyellow prisms of omegabrommethylfurfural chcch2br o chccho this reaction is produced by lvulose sorbose cane sugar and inulin an intense colour being given within an hour or two dextrose maltose milk sugar galactose and the polyhydric alcohols give if anything only insignificant colours and these only after long standing the authors therefore suggested that the reaction might be employed as a means of distinguishing these classes of carbohydrates the rapid production of the purple colour being indicative of ketohexoses or of substances which produce these by hydrolysis by relying only on the production of the purple colour however a mistake might possibly arise owing to the fact that xylose gives a somewhat similar colour after standing for a few hours hence the observations should be confirmed by isolation of the crystals of brommethylfurfural no trace of this substance is obtained from the xylose product in order to identify the substance the ether extract after neutralisation is allowed to evaporate to a syrup and crystallisation promoted either by rubbing with a glass rod or by the more certain and highly characteristic method of sowing with the most minute trace of omegabrommethylfurfural when crystals are almost instantly formed these are recrystallised from ether or a mixture of ether and light petroleum and further identified by the meltingpoint 595605 and if considered desirable by estimation of the bromine it is now found so reactive is the bromine atom in this compound that the estimation may be accurately made by titration with silver nitrate according to volhards process the crystals for this purpose being dissolved in dilute alcohol 01970 gram required 105 cc n10 agno3 br 4263 pct calculated 4232 pct this method of applying hydrogen bromide in ethereal solution is of course unsuitable for investigations where a higher temperature has to be employed or where long standing is necessary since under such circumstances the ether itself is attacked wishing to make investigations under these conditions the authors have tried several solvents and at present find that chloroform is best suited to the purpose in each of the following experiments 10 grms of the substance were covered with 250 cc of chloroform which had been saturated at 0 with dry hydrogen bromide the mixture was contained in an accurately stoppered bottle firmly secured with an iron clamp and heated in a waterbath to about the boiling temperature for two hours after standing for several hours the mixture was treated with sodium carbonate first anhydrous solid and afterwards a few drops of strong solution filtered and the solution dried over calcium chloride most of the chloroform was then distilled off and the remaining solution allowed to evaporate to a thick syrup in a weighed dish the product was then tested for omegabrommethylfurfural by sowing with the most minute trace of the substance as described above it was then warmed on a wateroven kept in a vacuum desiccator over solid paraffin and the weight estimated when necessary the product was recrystallised from ether and further identified by the tests mentioned the following results were obtained weight of crude residue swedish filter paper 30 crystallised at once by sowing ordinary cotton 33 mercerised cotton 21 straw cellulose6 23 lvulose 22 inulin 13 potato starch 037 cane sugar 085 dextrose 033 uncrystallisable milk sugar 037 glycogen 034 galactose 034 the products from dextrose milk sugar and galactose absolutely refused to crystallise even when extracted with ether and again evaporated or by sowing stirring c the glycogen product deposited a very small amount of crystalline matter on standing but the quantity was too minute for examination moreover it refused altogether to crystallise in contact with the aldehyde it may fairly be stated therefore that these last four substances give absolutely negative results as regards the formation of omegabrommethylfurfural if any is formed its quantity is altogether too small to be detected the specimen of starch examined was freshly prepared from potato and purified by digestion for twentyfour hours each with n10 koh n4 hcl and strong alcohol it was then washed with water and allowed to dry in the air it will be seen that this substance gave a positive result but that the yield was extremely small and might yet be due to impurity considering the importance of the behaviour of starch for the purpose of drawing general conclusions from these observations it was thought advisable to make further experiments with specimens which could be relied upon and also to investigate the behaviour of dextrin this the authors have been enabled to do upon a series of specimens specially prepared by c osullivan and thus described by him 1 rice starch specially purified by the permanganate method 2 wheat starch 3

alphadextrin c equation purified without fermentation 30 precipitations with alcohol trans 1879 35 772 the examination of these specimens was conducted on a smaller scale but under the same conditions as before one gram of the substance being treated with 125 cc of the saturated chloroform solution and heated in sealed tubes for two hours as above the results were as follows weight of crude residue 1 rice starch 0046 crystallised at once by sowing 2 wheat starch 0044 3 oat starch 0049 4 pea starch 0064 5 natural dextrin 0088 6 alphadextrin 0055 the results may therefore be summarised as followstreated under these particular conditions all forms of cellulose give large yields of omegabrommethylfurfural some varieties giving as much as 33 per cent lvulose inulin and cane sugar give yields varying from 22 to 85 per cent various starches give small yields average about 45 per cent and dextrins 5 to 8 per cent whereas dextrose milk sugar and galactose give apparently none at all the yields represent the solid crystalline residue this when purified by recrystallisation gives probably about threequarters of its weight of pure crystals in the case of dextrose c the yields represent the weight of syrup these numbers however by no means represent the maximum yields obtainable owing to the comparatively slight solubility of hydrogen bromide in chloroform the process was conducted in the above manner only for the sake of uniform comparison the ether method previously described gives much larger yields for example 12 grms of inulin treated with only 60 cc of the saturated ether gave 25 grms of substance for the purpose of obtaining larger yields other methods are being investigated the facts recorded above taken in conjunction with those given in our previous communications appear to point definitely to the following general conclusions first that the various forms of cellulose contain one or more groups or nuclei identical with that contained in lvulose and that such groups constitute the main or essential part of the molecule secondly that similar groupings are contained in starches and dextrins but that the proportion of such groupings represents a relatively small part of the whole structure the nature of this grouping is according to the generally accepted constitution of lvulose the sixcarbon chain with a ketonic group cccccc o but the

the determination of cellwall constituents hemicelluloses and cellulose in plants and plant tissues in a preliminary discussion the author critically compares the results of various of the methods in

known presumably the most widely practised w hoffmeisters modification of the above in which the nitric acid is replaced by hydrochloric acid 10 pct hcl is next noted as reducing the time of digestion from 14 days to 12 days and giving in many cases higher yields of cellulose the methods of treating with the halogens viz bromine water h mller chlorine gas cross and bevan and chlorine water are dismissed with a bare mention apparently on the basis of the conclusions of suringar and tollens qv the method of lange the basis of which is a fusion with alkaline hydrates at 180 and the modified method of gabriel in which the fusion with alkali takes place in presence of glycerin are favourably mentioned these methods were applied to a range of widely different raw materials to determine by critical examination of the products both as regards yield and composition what title these latter have to be regarded as pure cellulose this portion of the investigation is an extension of that of suringar and tollens these latter confining themselves to celluloses of the normal groups ie textile and papermaking celluloses the present communication is a study of the tissue and cellwall

cellulose by the method of lange b hoffmeister c and schulze d and the numbers obtained are referred for comparison to the corresponding yields of crude fibre rohfaser by the standard method a as a first result the author dismisses langes method as hopeless the results in successive determinations on the same materials showing variations up to 60 pct the results by c and d are satisfactorily concordant the yields of cellulose are higher than of crude fibre this is obviously due to the conservation of hemicellulose products which are hydrolysed and dissolved in the treatments for crude fibre estimation a modified method was next investigated in which the process of digestion with acid chloroxy compounds c and d was preceded by a treatment with boiling dilute acid the yields of cellulose by this method e are more uniform and show less divergence from the numbers for crude fibre the authors numerical results are given in a series of tables which include determinations of proteids and ash constituents and the corresponding deductions from the crude weight in calculating to pure cellulose the subjoined extract will illustrate these main lines of investigation crude

evaporating the ammonia from the schweizers extract at the ordinary temperature and on a waterbath respectively different amounts of cellulose are obtained more hemicellulose is obtained by caustic soda from the heated solution than from that which was not heated in this operation the pentosanes are more influenced than the hexosanes pentosanes are not always readily dissolved by caustic soda and hexosanes are frequently more or less readily dissolved both occur in lignin and are then undoubtedly indigestible these points have to be considered in judging the digestibility of these carbohydrates a comparison of analyses of clover at different periods in the first and second years of growth shows that both cellulose schweizers extract and lignin increase in both constituents in the second year the lignin alone increased to the end the cellulose decreased at the end of june in the first year it seemed an absolutely as well as relatively greater amount of cellulose and lignin

original straws for the isolation of the celluloses the straws are treated by a severe process of alkaline hydrolysis to which therefore the furfuroid groups offer equal resistance with the normal

weeks in a desiccator it was noted at the same time that the colour reaction of the original solution with phloroglucol and hydrochloric acid was a deep violet in contradistinction to the characteristic red of the pentoses on oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in the proportion of 1 mol h2o2 to 1 mol of the carbohydrate in solution carbonic anhydride was formed in quantity 200 pct of the latter fermentation yeast experiments also showed a divergence from the resistant behaviour of the pentoses a considerable proportion of the furfuroid disappearing in a normal fermentation 2 the quantitative methods above described were employed in investigating the barley plant at different stages of its growth the green plant was extracted with alcohol the residue freed from alcohol and subjected to acid hydrolysis the hydrolysed extract was neutralised and fermented in the early stages of growth the furfuroids were completely fermented ie disappeared in the fermentation in the later stages this proportion fell to 50 pct in the earlier stages moreover the normal hexose constituents of the permanent tissue were hydrolysed in large proportion by the acid whereas in the matured straw the hydrolysis is chiefly confined to the furfuroids in the early stages also the permanent tissue yields an extract with relatively low cupric reduction showing that the carbohydrates are dissolved by the acid in a more complex molecular condition these observations confirm the view that the furfuroids take origin in a hexosepentose series of transformations the proportion of furfuroid groups to total carbohydrates varies but little viz from 13 in the early stages to a maximum of 14 at the flowering period at this period the differentiation of the groups begins to be marked taking all the facts of 1 and 2 they are not inconsistent with the hypothesis of an internal transformation of a hexose to a pentosemonoformal such a change of position and function of oxygen from oh to co within the group choh is a species of internal oxidation which reverses the reduction of formaldehyde groups in synthesising to sugars and appears therefore of probable occurrence these constitutional problems are followed up in 3 by the indirect method of differentiating the relationships of these furfuroids to yeast fermentation from those of the pentoses straw and esparto celluloses are subjected to the processes of acid hydrolysis and the neutralised extracts fermented with high furfural numbers indicating that the furfuroids are the chief constituents of the extract there is an active fermentation with production of alcohol the cupric reduction falls in greater ratio to the original unfermented than the furfural observations on the pure pentosesxylose and arabinose added to dextrose solutions and then exposed to yeast actionshow that in a vigorous fermentation not unduly prolonged the pentoses are unaffected but that they do come within the influence of the yeastcell when the latter is in a less vigorous condition and when the hexoses are not present in relatively large proportion 4 the observations on the growing plant were resumed with the view of artificially increasing the differentiation of the two main groups of carbohydrates from a portion of a barley crop the inflorescence was removed as soon as it appeared the crop was allowed to mature and a full comparison instituted between the products of normal and abnormal growth with a considerable difference in permanent tissue 13 pct less and a still greater defect in cellulose 24 pct the constants for the furfuroids in relation to total carbohydrates were unaffected by the arrested development this was also true of the behaviour of the hydrolysed extracts acid processes to yeast fermentation 5 the extract obtained from the brewers grains by the process described in 2 was investigated in relation to animal digestion it has been now generally established that the furfuroids as constituents of fodder plants are digested and assimilated in large proportion in passing through animal digestive tracts and in this respect behave differently from the pentoses the furfuroids being obtained as described in a fully hydrolysed condition monoses the digestion problem presented itself in a new aspect and was therefore attacked the result of the comparative feeding experiments upon rabbits was to show that in this previously hydrolysed form the furfuroids are almost entirely digested and assimilated no pentoses moreover appearing in the urine generally we may sum up the present solution of the problem of the relationship of the furfuroids to plant assimilation and growth as followsthe pentoses are not produced as such in the process of assimilation but furfuralyielding carbohydrates are produced directly and in approximately constant ratio to the total carbohydrates they are mainly located in the permanent tissue in the secondary changes of dehydration c accompanying maturation they undergo such differentiation that they become readily separable by processes of acid hydrolysis from the more resistant normal celluloses but in relation to alkaline treatments they maintain their intimate union with the latter they are finally converted into pentoses by artificial treatments and into pentosanes in the plant with loss of 1 c atom in an oxidised form the mechanism of this transformation of hexoses into pentoses is not cleared up it is independent of external conditions eg fertilisation and atmospheric oxidations and is probably therefore a process of internal rearrangement of the character of an oxidation zur kenntniss der in den membranen der pilze enthaltenen bestandtheile e winterstein ztschr physiol chem 1894 521 1895 134 on the constituents of the tissue of fungi p 87 these two communications are a contribution of fundamental importance and may be regarded as placing the question of the composition of the celluloses of these lowest types on a basis of welldefined fact in the first place the author gives an exhaustive bibliography beginning with the researches of braconnot 1811 who regarded the cellular tissue of these organisms as a specialised substance which he termed fungin payen rejects this view and regards the tissue fully purified by the action of solvents as a cellulose c6h10o5 this view is successively supported by fromberg mulder allg phys chem braunschweig 1851 schlossberger and doepping annalen 52 106 and kaiser de bary on a review of the evidence adopts this view but as the purified substance fails to give the characteristic colourreactions with iodine he uses the qualifying term pilzcellulose morph u biol d pilze u flechten leipzig 1884 c richter on the other hand shows that these reactions are merely a question of methods of purification or preparation sitzungsber acad wien 82 1 494 and considers that the tissuesubstance is an ordinary cellulose with the ordinary reactions masked by the presence of impurities in regard to the lower types of fungoid growth such as yeast the results of investigators are more at variance the researches of salkowski p 113 leave little doubt however that the cellmembrane is of the cellulosic type the authors researches extend over a typical range of products obtained from boletus edulis agaricus campestris cantharellus cibarius morchella esculenta

this residual nitrogen is not in the form of residual proteids 1 by direct tests all of which gave negative results and 2 indirectly by the high degree of resistance to both alkaline and acid

weight of dextrose as an extreme hydrolytic treatment the products were dissolved in 70 pct h2so4 allowed to stand 24 hours then considerably diluted to 3 pct h2so4 and boiled to complete the inversion the yields of glucose calculated from the cupric reduction were as follows boletus edulis 652 pct polyporus off 947 agaricus campestris 591 morchella esculenta 601 cantharellus cib 649 botrytis 608 it will be noted that the exceptionally high yield from the polyporus cellulose is correlated with its exceptionally low nitrogen by actual isolation of a crystalline dextrorotary sugar by preparations of osazone and conversion into saccharic acid it was proved that dextrose was the main product of hydrolysis the second main product was shown to be acetic acid the yield of which amounted to 8 pct in several cases generally therefore it is proved that the more resistant tissue constituents of the fungi are not cellulose but a complex of carbohydrates and nitrogenous groups in combination the former being resolved into glucoses by acid hydrolysis and the latter yielding acetic acid as a characteristic product of resolution together with the nitrogenous groups in the form of an uncrystallisable syrup in the further prosecution of these investigations 2 the author proceeded from the supposition of the identity of the nitrogenous complex of the original with chitin and adopted the method of ledderhose ztschr physiol chem 2 213 for the isolation of glucosamin hydrochloride which he succeeded in obtaining in the crystalline form in the meantime e gilson had shown that these tissue substances in fusion with alkaline hydrates yield a residue of a nitrogenous product c14h28n2o10 which is soluble in dilute acids recherches chim sur la membrane cellulaire des

resembling chitin see also gilson compt rend 120 1000 this constituent is in intimate union with the carbohydrate complex which is resolved similarly to the hemicelluloses various intermediate terms

peroxide acting in presence of ferrous salts the chohchoh residue losing h2 with production of the unsaturated group ohccoh these investigations have subsequently been considerably developed and generalised by fenton but as the results have no immediate bearing on our main subject we must refer readers to the j chem soc 18961900 from the mode of action diagnosed by fenton it was to be expected that the choh groups of the carbohydrates would be oxidised to co groups and it has been established by the above investigations 1 and 2 that the particular group to be so affected in the hexoses is that contiguous to the typical co group there results therefore a dicarbonyl derivative osone which reacts directly with 2 mol phenyl hydrazine in the cold to form an osazone this was directly established for glucose lvulose galactose and arabinose 2 while this is the main result the general study of the product shows that the oxidation is not simple nor in direct quantitative relationship to the h2o2 employed the molecular proportion of the aldoses affected appears to be in considerable excess and the reaction is probably complicated by interior rearrangement in the main the original aldehydic group resists the oxidation but a certain proportion of acid products are formed probably tartronic acid on distillation with condensing acids a large proportion of volatile monobasic acids chiefly formic are obtained the proportion of furfural obtained amounts to 34 per cent of the weight of the original carbohydrate since the general result of these oxidations is the substitution of an oh group for an h atom it was of interest to determine the behaviour of furfural with the peroxide the oxidation was carried out in dilute aqueous solution of the aldehyde at 2040 using 23 mols h2o2 per 1 mol c5h4o2 the main product is a hydroxyfurfural which was separated as a hydrazone a small quantity of a monobasic acid was formed which was identified as a hydroxypyromucic acid both aldehyde and acid appear to be the alpha beta derivatives the aldehyde gives very characteristic colour reactions with phloroglucinol and resorcinol in presence of hydrochloric acid which so closely resemble those of the lignocelluloses that there is little doubt that these particular reactions must be referred to the presence of the hydroxyfurfural as a normal constituent the study of these oxidations was then extended to typical unsaturated hydrocarbonsviz acetylene and benzene 4 from the former the main product was acetic acid but the attendant formation of traces of ethyl alcohol indicates that the hydrogen of the peroxide may take a direct part in this and other reactions this view receives some support from the fact that the interaction of the h2o2 with permanganates has now been established to be an oxidation of the h2 of the peroxide by the permanganate oxidation with liberation therefore of the o2 of the peroxide as an unresolved molecule baeyer benzene itself is also powerfully attacked by the peroxide when shaken with a dilute solution in presence of iron salts the products are phenol and pyrocatechol with some quantity of an amorphous product probably formed by condensation of a quinone with the phenolic products of reaction these types of oxidation effects now established give a definite significance to the physiological functions of the peroxide which is a form of active oxygen of extremely wide distribution it would have been difficult a priori to devise an oxidant without sensible action on aldehydic groups yet delivering a powerful attack on hydrocarbon rings or to have suggested a synthesis of the sugars from tartaric acid with a powerful oxidising treatment as the first and essential stage in the transformation our present knowledge of such actions and effects suggests a number of new clues to genetic relationships of carbon compounds within the plant the conclusion is certainly justified that the origin of the pentoses is referable to oxidations of the hexoses in which this form of active oxygen plays an important part we must note here the researches of o ruff who has applied these oxidations with important results in the systematic investigation of the carbohydrates ueber die verwandlung der dgluconsure in darabinose berl ber 1898 1573 conversion of dgluconic acid into darabinose d und l arabinose ibid 1899 550 zur kenntniss der oxygluconsure ibid 1899 2269 on oxygluconic acid ruff in these researches has realised a simple and direct transition from the hexoses to the pentoses by oxidising gluconic acid with the peroxide the beta choh group is converted into carbonyl at the same time that the terminal cooh alpha is oxidised to co2 the yields of the resulting pentose are large simultaneously there is formed an oxygluconic acid which appears to be a ketonic acid of formula ch2ohcochoh3cooh from these results we see a further range of physiological probabilities and with the concurrent actions of oxygen in the forms of or related to hydrogen peroxide on the one side and ozone on the other we are able to account in a simple way for the relationships of the furfuroid group which may include a number of intermediate terms in the hexosepentose series following in this direction of development of the subject is a study of the action of persulphuric acid upon furfural einwirkung des caroschen reagens auf furfural c f cross e j bevan and j f briggs berl ber 1900 3132 regarding this reagent as another form of active oxygen it is important to contrast its actions with those of the hydrogen peroxide instead of the betahydroxyfurfural ante 115 we obtain the deltaaldehyde as the first product the aldehydic group is then oxidised and as a result of attendant hydrolysis the ring is broken down and succinic acid is formed the original aldehydic group of the furfural being split off in the form of formic acid the reactions take place at the ordinary temperature and with the dilute form of the reagent described by baeyer and villiger ber 32 3625 these results have some special features of interest the alpha deltahydroxyfurfural has similar colour reactions to those of the alpha betaderivative and may also therefore be present as a constituent of the lignocelluloses the tendency to attack in the 14 position in relation to an aldehydic group further widens the capabilities of active oxygen in the plant cell lastly this is the simplest transition yet disclosed from the succinyl to furfural grouping being effected by a regulated proportion of oxygen and under conditions of reaction which may be described as of the mildest in regard to the widereaching functions of asparagin in plant life we have a new suggestion of genetic connections with the furfuroids vergleich der

from 052 to 055 in calculating from phloroglucide to furfural the greatest total range of variation was found to be 25 pct the phenol process is therefore equally accurate has the advantages above noted and in addition is less liable to error from the pressure in the distillates obtained from vegetable substances of volatile products eg ketonic compounds accompanying the furfural this method has been criticised by helbel and zeisel sitzber wiener akad 1895 104 ii p 335 on two grounds of error viz 1 the presence of diresorcinol in all ordinary preparations of phloroglucinol and 2 changes in weight of the precipitate of phloroglucide on drying the process was carried out comparatively with ordinary preparations and with specially pure preparations of the phenol the quantitative results were identical the criticisms in question are therefore dismissed although the process is to be recommended for its simplicity and the satisfactory concordance of results it is to be noted that it

diresorcinol is without influence on the result provided a sufficient excess of actual phloroglucinol is employed thus even with a preparation containing 30 pct of its weight of diresorcinol the influence of the latter is eliminated provided a weight be taken equal to twice that of the furfural to be precipitated the phenol must be perfectly dissolved by warming with dilute hcl 106 spgr

the authors original ms section vi the lignocelluloses p 131 lignocellulose estersby a fuller study of the ester reactions of the normal celluloses we have been able to throw some light on the constitutional problems involved and we have extended the investigations to the jute fibre as a type of the lignocelluloses from the results of which we get a clearer idea of the relationships of the constituent groups taking the empirical expression for the complex ie the entire lignocellulose the formula c12h18o9 we shall be able to compare the ester derivatives with those of the celluloses which we have also referred to a c12 unit but we shall require also to deal with the constituent groups of the complex which for the purposes of this discussion may be regarded as a a cellulose of normal characteristicscellulose alpha b a cellulose yielding furfural on boiling with condensing acidscellulose beta and c a much condensed and in part benzenoid group which we may continue to term the lignone group the latter has been specially examined with regard to its proportion of oh groups as a necessary preliminary to the investigation of esters in producing which the entire complex is employed it will be shown that the ester groups can be actually localised in various ways as in the main entering the cellulose residues alpha and beta but that the lignone group takes little part in the reactions may be generally concluded on the evidence of its nonreactivity as an isolated derivative 1 by chlorination c it is isolated in the form of an amorphous body but of constant composition represented by the formula c19h18cl4o9 this compound soluble in acetic anhydride was boiled with it for six hours after adding fused sodium acetate and the product separated by pouring into water the dilute acid filtered from the product contained no hydrochloric acid nor byproducts of action the product showed an increase of weight of 75 pct for one acetyl per 1 mol c19h18cl4o the calculated increase is 80 pct it is evident from the nature of the derivative that this result cannot be further verified by the usual analytical methods 2 the chlorinated derivative is entirely soluble in sodium sulphite solution this solution shaken with benzoyl chloride with addition of sodium hydrate in successive portions shows only a small formation of insoluble benzoate which separates as a tarry precipitate 3 the empirical formula of the lignone complex in its isolated forms indicates that very little hydrolysis occurs in the processes of isolation thus the chlorinated product we may assume to be derived from the complex c19h22o9 in the soluble byproducts from the bisulphite processes of pulping wood the lignone exists as a sulphonated derivative c24h23och32so3ho7 the original lignone may be regarded as passing into solution as a still condensed complex derived from c24h26o12 tollens there is evidently little attendant hydroxylation and another essential feature is the small molecular proportion of groups showing the typical sulphonation it appears that in the lignone the elements are approximately in the relation c6 h6 o3 and it may assist this discussion to formulate the main constitutional types consistent with this ratio viz 1 the trihydroxybenzenes c6h3oh3 2 methylhydroxyfurfural c5h2oohch3 ch3 3 methylhydroxypyrone coc4h2 o oh 4 trioxycyclohexane chchchchchch o o o it is probable that all these types of condensation are represented in the lignone molecules since the derivatives yielded in decompositions of more or less regulated character are either directly derived from or related to such groups for the moment we pass over all but the general fact of complexity and the marked paucity of ohgroups it would be of importance to be able to formulate the exact mode of union of the lignone with the cellulose residues to constitute the lignocellulose the evidence however does not carry us farther than the probability of union by complicated groups and of large dimensions for not only is the lignone isolated in condensed and nonhydroxylated forms but the cellulose also is not hydrated or hydrolysed further than in the ratio 3c6h10o5h2o it is probable therefore that the water combining with the residues at the moment of their resolution is relatively small lastly we have to remember when dealing with the statistical results of the reactions to be described that the approximate proportions per cent of the constituent groups are cellulose alpha 65 beta 15 100 lignocellulose lignone 20 jute benzoatesin preparing the jute for treatment it was boiled in alkaline solution 1 per cent naoh washed with water and dilute acid again washed dried and weighed in the ester reaction the reagents were employed in the proportion c12h18o9 3naoh 2c6h5cocl a series of quantitative experiments gave yields of 126130 pct of benzoate calculated for monobenzoate 134 pct the results were confirmed by ultimate analysis the monobenzoate therefore represents a maximum and this molecular proportion is onehalf of that observed with the normal cellulose calculated to the same unit localisation of benzoyl groupthe entrance of the ester group affects the typical colour reactions of the lignocellulose which are fainter the ferric ferricyanide reaction almost disappears the lignone group is unaffected and combines with chlorine as in the original the lignone chloride is removed by sodium sulphite solution and the residue is a cellulose benzoate the loss of weight due to the elimination of the lignone was 127 pct calculating per 100 of the original lignocellulose this becomes 16 these statistics further confirm the localisation of the benzoyl group in the cellulose residue it is to be noted that the presence of the benzoyl group renders the cellulose more resistant to hydrolytic actions thus to bring out this fact more prominently we may calculate the yield of residual cellulose benzoate pct of original jute and we find it 109 pct taking a maximum proportion for original celluloseviz 85this benzoate represents a yield of 129 pct as against the theoretical for a monobenzoate 132 pct furfural numbersthe percentage of furfural obtained by boiling with hcl of 106 spgr was 302 and 329 in separate determinations calculating to the original lignocellulose the percentage 421 indicates a considerable loss of the furfuralyielding constituent the effect was also apparent in the cellulose benzoate isolated by chlorination c the percentage being 139 pct and calculated to the original jute benzoate 159 pct under the conditions adopted in dissolving away the chlorinated lignone the original nonbenzoated lignocellulose would have yielded a cellulose giving 6 to 7 pct furfural since the benzoyl group is hardly calculated to produce a constitutional change affecting the furfural constants it was necessary to examine the effect of the preliminary alkaline treatment and the change in the furfuroid group was in fact localised in this reaction it was found that on washing the alkali from the mercerised jute and further purifying the residue this latter yielded only 42 pct furfural 34 pct on original fibre the alkaline solution and washings were acidified and distilled from 10 pct hcl yielding an additional 36 pct calculated to the original lignocellulose by treatment with the concentrated alkali therefore the furfuroid of the original lignocellulose undergoes little change but is selectively dissolved this point is under further investigation p 132 acetylation of lignocellulosesacetates are readily formed by boiling the lignocelluloses with acetic anhydride the derivatives obtained from jute are only generally mentioned in the 1st edition p 132 a further study of the reactions in regard to special points has led to some more definite results the yields of product by the ordinary and simple process are 114115 pct but on analysing the product an important discrepancy is revealed for the saponification we employ a solution of sodium ethylate in the cold the following numbers were obtained acetic acid hydrocellulose residue 272 778 calc for diacetate on c12h18o9 308 784 the derivative is approximately a diacetate and on the assumption of a simple ester reaction the yield should be 127 pct assuming that the difference of 13 pct is due to loss of water by internal condensation it appears that for each acetyl group entering 2 mol h2o are split off the jute acetate showed the normal reaction with chlorine and the lignone chloride was dissolved by treatment with sodium sulphite solution the fibrous residue was colourless it proved to be a cellulose acetate the following numbers were obtained on saponification acetic acid cellulose 316 700 309 688 calc for diacetate on c12h20o10 294 799 the interpretation of these numbers appears to be this in the original reaction with the lignocellulose it is the cellulose residue which is acetylated and at the same time condensed the cellulose residue which undergoes condensation is not of the normal constitution since the normal cellulose is acetylated without condensation see p 41 on saponification a portion of the cellulose in again combining with water is hydrolysed to soluble products the lignone group as it exists in the lignocellulose has no free oh groups and probably no free aldehydic groups such as would react with the anhydride such groups may however be originally present and may take part in the internal condensations which have been shown to occur the furfural constants of the lignocellulose are unaffected by the acetylation and condensation the hygroscopic moisture of the product is lowered from 1011 pct in the original to 45 pct the ferric ferricyanide reaction is inhibited by the disappearance of the reactive groups upon which this curious and characteristic phenomenon depends 1st ed acetylation of benzoatesthe cellulose dibenzoate c12 basis and the jute monobenzoate were acetylated under comparative conditions the results were as follows c12 basis cellulose dibenzoate jute monobenzoate calc for calc for found diacetate on found diacetate on ester reaction dibenzoate monobenzoate yield 111 pct 115 pct 124 pct 120 pct saponification cellulose lignocellulose 535 526 598 619 naoh combining 213 239 284 243 from these results it would appear that the number of acetyl groups entering the benzoates is the same as with the unbenzoylated fibres the benzoyl has no influence upon the hydroxyls as against the acetyl at the same time the internal condensation noticed in the acetylation of the jute appears not to occur in the case of the benzoate nitric estersthe numbers resulting from the quantitative study of the ester reaction and product 1st ed p 133 show a very large divergence of the yield of product from that which would be calculated from its composition n pct on the assumption that the ester reaction is simple we have repeated the results and find with a yield of 145 pct that the product contains 118 pct n the reaction c12h18o9 4hno3 4h2o gives a tetranitrate with 115 pct n and a yield of 159 pct the ester reaction therefore is not simple there are two sources of the loss of weight the first of these is evident from the occurrence of certain secondary reactions which result in the solution of a certain proportion of the fibre substance in the acid mixture to determine this quantitatively we have devised a suitable variation of the method of combustion with chromic acid 1st ed the variation is required to meet the difficulty occasioned by the tension of the nitric acid and products of deoxidation the mixed acids 10 cc containing the organic byproducts in solution are carefully diluted in a small flask with an equal volume of water preventing rise of temperature nitrous fumes are evolved during the dilution strong sulphuric acid 15 cc is now added and the residue of nitrous fumes expelled by a current of air agitating the contents of the flask from time to time the combustion with cro3 is then proceeded with in the ordinary way the gases evolved are measured total volume and calculated to c present in the form of products derived from the lignocellulose and assuming that this contains 47 pct c we may express the result approximately in terms of the fibre substance the method was controlled by blank experiments in which citric acid was taken as a convenient carbon compound for combustion the c found was 349 pct as against 343 pct calculated by this method we find that with maximum yields of nitrate at 143145 pct the organic matter in solution in the acid mixture amounted to 49 to 53 pct of the original lignocellulose introducing this quantity as a correction of the yield of nitrate in the original reaction we must express the 143 parts as obtained from 95 of fibre substance instead of 100 the yield per molecule c12h18o9 306 is therefore 462 whereas for a tetranitrate formed by a simple ester reaction the yield should be 486 the difference 24 represents 15 mol h2o split off by internal condensation the correction for total n is relatively small raising it from 115 to 122 which remains in close agreement with the experimental numbers monobenzoatetreated with the acid mixture yields a mixed nitrate the yield is 130 pct and the product contains 76 pct ono2 nitrogen these numbers approximate to those required for reaction with 4hno3 groups three of the residues entering the cellulose and one as no2 the benzene ring of the substituting group for such a reaction the calculated numbers are yield 144 pct ono2 nitrogen 71 pct the experimental numbers require correcting for the amount of loss in the form of products soluble in the acid mixture viz 76 pct but they remain within the range of the experimental errors sufficiently to show that the benzoyl group limits the number of oh groups taking part in the ester reaction to three the corrected yield per 1 mol of jute benzoate 410 is 576 as against the calculated 590 for 4hno3 reacting a loss of 1h2o per molecule by internal condensation is therefore indicated denitrationthe removal of the nitric groups from the esters is effected by digestion with ammonium sulphide but the reactions are by no means simple there is considerable hydrolysis of the lignocellulose to soluble products thus the tetranitrate yields only 464 of denitrated fibre in place of the calculated 66 the product is a cellulose yielding only 05 per cent furfural the hydrolysed byproducts moreover when freed from sulphur and distilled from hydrochloric acid yielded only an additional 25 pct furfural calculated to the original lignocellulose these statistics confirm the evidence that the ester reaction is not simple such changes take place in the lignonebetacellulose complex that they revert not to their original form but to soluble derivatives of different constitution the mixed nitrate from the benzoate is denitrated to a cellulose amidobenzoate which confirms the localisation of a nitrogroup in the benzoyl residue p 157 general characteristics of the lignocelluloseslater investigations have somewhat modified and simplified our views of the constitution of the typical lignocellulose jute so far as this can be dealt with by the statistics of its more important decompositions original pp 157161 cellulosethere is little doubt that the furfuralyielding groups of the original are isolated in the form of the betacellulose tollens emphasises this fact in his studies of celluloseestimation methods we had previously shown original p 159 that the yield of furfural is not affected by the chlorination but it appears from our numbers that only 50 pct of these groups remain in the isolated cellulose the residue undergoing hydrolysis to soluble compounds in a carefully regulated hydrolysis following the chlorination it appears that the furfuroids are almost entirely conserved in the form of a cellulose moreover an investigation of the products dissolved by sodium sulphite solution from the chlorinated fibre has shown that they are practically free from furfuroids this enables us to exclude the furfuralyielding groups from the lignone complex at the same time through our later studies of the hydroxyfurfurals it is certain that these products are represented in the fibre substance and probably in the lignone complex chlorination statisticsit has been pointed out by a correspondentto whom we express our indebtednessthat we have made a mistake in calculating the proportion of lignone from the ratio of the cl combining with the fibre substance or lignocellulose pct to that of the cl present in the isolated lignone chloride pct the lignocellulose combines with chlorine in the ratio 100 8 but the lignone chloride containing 267 of chlorine means that neglecting the hydrogen substituted 73 of lignone combine with the 27 of chlorine approximately on the uniform percentage basis the calculated proportion of lignone would be 837 or a little over 20 pct in regard to the proportion of hydration attending the resolution we have shown on constitutional grounds that this must be relatively small assuming approximately the formula c19h22o9 for the lignone residue as it exists in combination and the anhydride formula for the cellulose these revised statistics now appear as regards the carbon contents of the lignocellulose cellulose 444 c lignone 578 80 444 100 3552 20 578 100 1156 4708 pct c in lignocellulose these conclusions are in accordance with the experimental facts and taken together with the new evidence we have accumulated from a study of the lignocellulose esters we may sum up the constitutional points as follows the lignocellulose is a complex of cellulose alpha cellulose beta lignone 65 pct 15 pct 20 allied to the normal yielding furfural onethird of which celluloses approximately 50 pct is of benzenoid type the lignone contains but little

these results establish the general identity of this peculiar product of plant life with the lignocelluloses at the same time that they show that certain of the colour reactions supposed to characterise the lignocelluloses are due to byproducts which may or may not be present p 172 composition of elder pithin a systematic investigation of the celluloses in relation to function we shall have to give special attention to the parenchymatous tissues of all kinds these are for structural reasons not easily isolated for which reason and their generally inferior functions they do not

plant confirming the conclusion that the incrustation view of lignification is consistent only with the structural features of the changes and so far as it has assumed the gradual overlaying of a cellulose fibre with the lignone substance it is not in accordance with the facts examination of the samples from the point of view of textile quality showed a superiority of no 1 in fineness softness and strength from this stage there is observed a progressive deterioration but the no 4 sample which was taken at the usual period of cutting is superior to no 5 in a further series of experiments c the jute was subjected to certain chemical treatments immediately after the separation of the fibre from the plant these consisted in steeping 1 in solution of sodium carbonate as well as of plant ashes and 2 in sulphite of soda the purpose of the treatments being to modify or arrest the changes which take place in the fibre when presspacked in bales for shipment the samples were shipped from india under the usual conditions and examined soon after arrival it was found that the chemical treatments had produced but small changes in chemical composition of the fibresubstance the sulphite treatment was the more marked in influence somewhat lowering the cellulose and nitration constants the conclusion drawn from the results was that they afford no prospect of any useful modification ie improvement of the textile quality of the fibre by any chemical treatments such as could be applied to the fibre on the spot before drying for presspacking and shipment the other matters investigated in the institute laboratory and reported on as indicated above are rather of commercial significance and contributed no points of moment to the chemistry of cellulose observations on some of the

ztschr angew chem 1898 15 on the cause of incomplete fermentation of sugars obtained by acid hydrolysis of wood the author criticises simonsens explanation of the results obtained with extracts from pine wood the incompleteness of fermentation of the products is certainly due in part to the presence of furfuralyielding carbohydrates which are resistant to yeast the pine woods contain 810 pct of these constituents in their anhydride form pentosanes they yield readily to acid hydrolysis and certainly constitute a considerable percentage of the dissolved products a similar complex was obtained by the author in his investigation of peat berl ber 30 2571 and was found to be similarly incompletely attacked by yeast the yields of alcohol corresponded with the proportion of the total

pentoses section viii industrial and technical general review the industrial uses of cellulose c f cross cantor lectures soc of arts 1897 p 273 a series of three lectures in which the more important industries in cellulose and its derivatives are dealt with on their scientific foundations and by means of a selection of typical problems in reference to textiles the small number of vegetable fibres actually available out of the endless variety afforded by the plant world is referred to the number of conditions required to be fulfilled by the individual fibre thus yield per cent of harvested weight or per unit of field area ease of extraction the absolute dimensions of the spinning unit and the proportion of variation from the mean dimensions the relative facility with which the unit fibre can be isolated preparatory to the final twisting operation the chemical constants of the fibre substance especially the percentage of cellulose and degree of resistance to hydrolysis it is suggested that any important addition to the very limited number fulfilling the conditions or any great improvement in these can only result from very elaborate artificial selection and cultural developments on this basis the paper making fibres are shown to fall into a scheme of classification based on chemical constitution and consisting of the four groups a cotton flax hemp rhea b wood celluloses c esparto straw and d lignocelluloses papers being exposed to the natural disintegrating agencies more especially oxygen water and hydrolysing agents generally and microorganisms the relative resistance of the above groups of raw materials is discussed as an important condition of value the indirect influence of the ordinary sizing and filling materials is discussed the papermaking quality of the fibrous raw materials is also discussed not merely from the point of view of the form and dimensions of the ultimate fibres but their capacity for colloidal hydration this is complementary to the action of rosin ie resin acids in the enginesizing of papers and the proof of the potency of this factor is seen in the superior effects obtained in sizing jointly with solutions of cellulose and more particularly viscose and rosin wursters muchcited monograph of the subject of rosinsizing le collage des papiers bull mulhouse 1878 neglects to take into consideration the contribution of the cellulose hydrates to the total and complex sizing effect and hence gives a partial view only of the function of the resin acids in further illustration of fundamental principles various developments in the textile industries are discussed eg the bleaching of jute cotton and flax and special developments in the spinning of rhea and flax the concluding lecture deals

artificial fibres lustracellulose on the other and the cellulose acetates la viscose et le viscoide c h bardy bull soc denc ind nationale 1900 march this is a report presented to the committee of economic arts of the above society dealing with the industrial progress in products obtained by means of the sulphocarbonate of cellulose viscose the following developments are noted enginesized

purification and sufficient ageing are available for various structural uses paintthe viscose is used as a vehicle for pigments the mixture being used either as a paint or for coating papers with fine surfaces such as required in the reproduction of photoblocks in these applications the extraordinary viscosity of the product conditions the economic use of the cellulose in competition with oils on the one hand and organic colloids such as gelatine casein c on the other by suitable alteration of the formula for making the paint a product is obtained which has an extraordinary power of removing paint from old painted surfaces the product has been officially adopted by the french admiralty and receives extensive application in removing the paint from ships filmsfilms are produced from the viscose itself in various ways plane or flat by solidifying the viscose on glass surfaces removing the byproducts and rolling the films the film is also produced by applying the viscose on textile fabrics drying down and fixing on a stenter machine then washing away the alkaline byproducts from the fixed film a large number of industrial effects are obtained by suitably varying the mixtures applied celluloseindiarubberthe viscose in its concentrated form can be incorporated with rubberhydrocarbon mixtures and these mixtures can be used both as waterproofing films as applied to textiles or can be solidified into the class of goods known as mechanicals the cellulose not only cheapens the mixture but produces new technical effects spinningthe viscose is spun by special methods patented

it is a thread of high lustre and more nearly approaches the normal cellulose in chemical properties than any of the other artificial silks it can also be spun in threads of very much larger diameter which can be used as a substitute for horsehair for carbonising for incandescent electric lamps c cellulose estersthese are conveniently made from cellulose regenerated from the solution as

committee appointed by the society of arts to inquire into the question of qualities of book papers in relation to their several applications and more especially for documents of permanent value the report first discusses the two directions of depreciation of papers in use 1 actual disintegration shown by loss of resistance to fracture by simple strain and by loss of elasticityie increase of brittleness 2 discolouration these are independent effects but often concurrent they are the result of chemical changes of the cellulose basis of the paper brought about by acids or oxidants used in the process of manufacture and not completely removed from the pulp or by acid products of bleachingeg oxycelluloses or chlorinated derivatives again by the changes of starch used as a sizing agent or by oxidations induced by rosin constituents when the rosin is used in excess discolouration is an attendant phenomenon of these changes but is more frequently due to the presence of the lowergrade celluloses esparto and straw and the lignocelluloses mechanical woodpulp the physical and chemical qualities of papers depending primarily upon their fibrous or pulp basis and in a secondary degree upon the kind and proportion of the constituents added for the purpose of filling and sizing the report concludes with the following recommendations positive and negative under these heads the committee find that the practical evidence as to permanence fully confirms the classification given in the cantor lectures on cellulose 1897 j soc arts xlv 690696 and which ranges the papermaking fibres in four classes a cotton flax and hemp rhea b wood celluloses a sulphite process and b soda and sulphate process c esparto and straw celluloses d mechanical woodpulp in regard therefore to papers for books and documents of permanent value the selection must be taken in this order and always with due regard to the fulfilment of the conditions of normal treatment above dealt with as common to all papers the committee have been desirous of bringing their investigations to a practical conclusion in specific termsviz by the suggestion of standards of quality it is evident that in the majority of cases there is little fault to find with the practical adjustments which rule the trade they are therefore satisfied to limit their specific findings to the followingviz 1 normal standard of quality for bookpapers required for publications of permanent value for such papers they specify as follows fibres not less than 70 pct of fibres of class a class d excluded sizing not more than 2 pct rosin and finished with the normal acidity of pure alum starch excluded loading not more than 10 pct total mineral matter ash 2 with regard to written documents it must be evident that the proper materials are those of class a and that the paper should be pure and sized with gelatin and not with rosin all imitations of highclass writingpapers which are in fact merely disguised

inclusivewhich is in fact a summary of the investigations of the institution in connection with paper and paperstandards p 273 special industrial developmentsfrom the point of view of the chemist there has been a very large development of the cellulose industries during the last five years this is not so much marked by the gradual and progressive growth of the wellestablished industries as by the success of the newer ones with the attendant forecast of enormous developments of the industries in artificial products the manufacture of which rests upon a purely chemical basis we can of course only treat them from this limited standpoint and so far as they involve and elucidate chemical principles i chemical treatments of raw materials a flaxspinningthe treatment of the roving on the spinningframe by the addition of reagents to the macerating liquidotherwise and usually hot watercontinues to be justified by results the technical basis of the process and the reactions determined in the spinningtrough by the alkaline salts usedchiefly sulphite and phosphate of sodais set forth in the original work p 280 since that time a sufficient period has elapsed to judge the effects both technical and industrial by the results of a commercial undertaking based on the exclusive use of the process such a concern is the irish flax spinning company of belfast at this mill the experience is uniform and fully established that by means of the process the drawing ie spinning quality of inferior flaxes is very considerably appreciated enabling the spinner to use such flaxes for yarns of fineness which are unattainable by the ordinary method of spinning through hot water notwithstanding the success of this undertaking the development of the method is still inconsiderable it is none the less a further and forcible demonstration of the existence of margins of increased technical effect which it is the work of the scientific technologist to exploit b woodpulp and methods of manufacturethere is a steady growth in the consumption of woodpulps cellulose relatively to other materials in regard to the papertrade of the world this continues to be one of the most prominent characteristics of its evolution in the united kingdom the conditions of its competition are of a more special kind by reason of the firm foothold of esparto which is a most important staple in the manufacture of fine printings whereas the consumption of esparto remains nearly stationary at about 200000 tons per annum the importation of woodpulps has shown the extraordinary rate of increase of doubling itself every five years but in the group woodpulps the trade returns have until recently included the mechanical or ground woodpulps from 1898 we have separate returns for the chemical or cellulose pulps and in 1899 the tonnage reached nearly to that of esparto with a total money value about 80 pct greater when it is remembered that this is one of the newer chemical industries in cellulose products and that these large commercial results have been accomplished during a period of twenty years we are impressed with the scope of the industrial outlook to the chemist afforded by the arts of which cellulose is the foundation it may be noted that there have been no important developments in the purely chemical processes involved in the several systems of preparing cellulose from wood the acid methods bisulphite processes have developed much more extensively than the alkaline the latter including the caustic soda and the mixed sulphide dahl process the bisulphite processes depended in the earlier stages upon the efficiency of leadlined digesters but the problem of acidresisting linings has been much more perfectly solved in later years in the various types of cement and other silicate linings now in use the relative permanency of these linings has had an important effect on the costs of production further economies result from the use of digesters of enormous capacity dealing with as much as 100 tons of wood at one operation as a combined result of economic production and active competition the selling prices of sulphite pulp have moved steadily downwards in relation to other halfstuffs and raw materials as a necessary consequence the prices of those which it has gradually displaced have depreciated and a study of the price and tonnageequilibrium as between rags esparto and woodpulp over a series of years forms an interesting objectlesson in the struggle for survival which is an especial mark of modern industry for these matters the reader is referred to the special literature of the papermaking industry12 it is not a little remarkable that the main byproduct of these bisulphite processesthe sulphonated derivatives of the lignone constituents of the woodis still for the most part an absolute waste notwithstanding the many investigations of technologists and attempts to convert it to industrial use see p 149 seeing that it represents a percentage on the wood pulped equal to that of the cellulose obtained it is a waste of potentially valuable material which can only be termed colossal moreover as a waste to be discharged into watercourses it becomes a source of burden and expense to the manufacturer and with the increasing restrictions on the pollution of rivers it is in many localities a difficulty to be reckoned with only by the cessation of the industry the problem in such cases becomes that of dealing with it destructively ie by evaporation and burning in this treatment the obviously high calorific value of the dissolved organic matter lignone appears on the credit side but where calcium and magnesium bisulphites are used the residue from calcination is practically without value it appears however that by substituting soda as the base the alkali is recoverable in such a form as to be directly available for the alkalinesulphide or dahl process as a more complicated alternative the soda admits of being recovered on the lines of the old blackash or leblanc process and the sulphur by the now wellestablished chance process for which of course an addition of lime is necessary to the fully evaporated liquors previously to calcining the engineering features of the system so far as regards evaporating and calcining are the same for economic working there is required a evaporation by multiple effect and b calcining on the continuous rotary principle for the latter a special modification has been devised so that the draught of air is concurrent with the movement of the charge in the furnace securing a progressively increasing temperature within the furnace this interesting development of the chemical engineering of woodpulp systems has been elaborated by two wellknown technologists drewson and dorenfeldt and readers who wish to inform themselves in detail of these developments are referred to the various publications of these inventors assuming the present necessity of a destructive treatment of the byproducts of the bisulphite processes the scheme has many advantages the sodabisulphite liquors are more economically prepared the pulp obtained is superior in papermaking quality to that resulting from the lime or magnesia bisulphite processes it is more economically bleached then as pointed out the soda may on the one plan be obtained in a form in which it is immediately available as a powerful hydrolysing alkali in the manufacture of a soda pulp these two systems become therefore in a new sense complementary to one another lastly it is obvious that the employment of soda as the base opens out a new vista for developing the electrolytic processes of decomposing common salt the authors have assisted in preparing plans for a comprehensive industrial scheme combining all these more modern developments in this scheme it is only the combination which is novel and as it involves no new principles in the chemical treatments of the materials we are not further concerned with it than to have briefly sketched its economic basis this may be summed up in result in the important question of cost and selling price and the estimate is well grounded that by means of this scheme bleached woodpulp can be sold on the english market at 10l a ton it is important to note this figure and to compare it with the prices of twenty years ago the fall has been continuous notwithstanding the influence of the opposing factors of increasing consumption exhaustion of accessible supply of timber and relative appreciation of the essential costs of steam chemicals and labour it is important in forecasting the future since the youngest and apparently most promising of the artificial cellulose industries employs woodcellulose by preference as its raw material see p 173 as a last point it must be considered that as chemists we are bound to anticipate the realisation of value in the soluble byproducts of the bisulphite processes outside the intrinsic interest attaching to the solution of this problem it carries with it the promise of a further economy in the production of woodcellulose bleaching of vegetable textilesby far the largest of these industries are those which are engaged in producing the pure white on cotton and flax goods the process considered chemically is simply that of isolating a pure cellulose and we endeavoured to give due prominence to this view in the original work it is important to insist upon it for the reason that this view gives the due proportion of chemical value to the several contributory treatmentsalkaline hydrolyses caustic lime and soda boils hypochlorite oxidations and incidental acid treatments souring the first of these is by far the largest contributor of chemical work though the second by being the agent for the actual whitening effect or bleaching action proper occupies a position of often exaggerated importance in bleaching processes there has been no radical change of system on the large scale since the introduction of the mather kier in 1885 and the associated change from lime and ash boiling to the caustic soda circulating boil with reduced volume of lye which this mechanical device rendered practicable it is outside the scope of this work to follow up this branch of technology in any detail and we cannot discuss the evolution of systems on variations of detail where no essential principle is involved but we have to notice a very recent development which has only just begun its industrial career and which does give effect to a principle of treatment not previously applied this is tersely stated by its originator william mather13 in the expression it is more economical to make liquids pass through cloth than to make cloth pass through liquids the starting point of this development is the invention of a complete selfcontained machine in which a rolled batch of cloth can receive a succession of chemical treatments with accessory washingsthe solutions or wash waters being circulated through the cloth the essential fact on which this system is based is that a perfect liquid circulation can be maintained from selvedge to selvedge through the folds of a tightly rolled batch of cloth such circulation is therefore quite independent of the diameter of the batch if we consider a cloth under chemical treatment with solutions it is clear that the reactions and interchanges of soluble matters within the cloth within the twisted elements of the yarn and in the last grade of distribution within the actual ultimate fibres are subject to capillary transmission and osmotic exchange there is a mixture of these molecular effects with the circulation in mass sweeping both faces of the cloth it is obvious that for the mass effect a relatively very small volume of circulating liquid is necessary to maintain uniform conditions of action in the actual disposition of the machine the rolled batch of cloth nearly fills the cylindrical space of what we may call the reaction chamber and the circulation of the liquid is maintained by a circulating pump and a differential pressure in the horizontal plane across and through the folds of the batch this is in the meantime kept in slow revolution for a full description of these mechanical details the reader is referred to the original patent specifications engl pat 23400 23401 1900 w mather if we again consider the principles involved they are very much as set forth in our original work pp 288291 boiling processes in which a relatively large volume of liquid is used are wasteful of steam the active agent is unnecessarily diluted or used in superfluous quantity and the soluble byproducts being continually removed as formed cannot so effectively contribute by secondary actions to the chemical work the new mechanical appliance enables us to further reduce the volume of liquid required in the alkalinehydrolytic treatment of vegetable textiles and where advantageous to bring the treatment down or up to a process of steaming with the active agent dissolved in a minimum proportion of water relative to the cloth this concentration of effect is of importance in flax cloth and especially linen treatment where the peculiarly resistant cutocelluloses have to be attacked and a considerable proportion of waxy byproducts to be removed these points are the basis of the special process of cross and parkes engl pat 25076 99 for steaming flax and cotton goods with an emulsion containing in addition to the special hydrolysing agentcaustic sodamixtures of soap with mineral or other oils the presence of which effectually aids the removal of the byproducts in question a complete system on these lines is now working on the industrial scale in the belfast district the results are not merely economical in largely reducing the number of alkaline boiling treatments required on the old plan of pan or pot boiling but are visible in the strength and finish of the linens so treated for cotton bleaching the costs may be put down at a fraction of those of the irish linen bleach the economical advantages of the new system are obviously less in relation to the lesser total costs but there are other points which have come into more prominent influence the mechanical wear and tear on the cloth is considerable in the ordinary process more especially in the manglewashes as a result the adjustment of warp and weft is more or less disturbed these defects are absent from a system which operates on the cloth in a fixed position but as we are mainly concerned with the purely chemical factors we cannot pretend to deal with textile questions we have to notice the remaining element of chemical economy as it involves a fundamental principle the practice of washing residues or products of reaction free from reagents and soluble byproducts involves a wellknown mathematical law under which the rate of purification is a function rather of the number of successive changes of washing liquid than of the volume of the latter the ordinary practice of textile washings entirely ignores this principle and the consumption of water in consequence may reach many thousand times the economic minimum with supplies of water often in indefinite excess of requirements even in this most wasteful method bleachers are in no need to consider the question of consumption but leaving aside particular and local considerations of advantage the fact is that the new system gives control of the practice of washing enabling the operator to adapt an important element of the daily routine to a fundamental principle which has been almost universally ignored in the oxidising processes which follow the alkaline treatments the hypochlorites are still the staple agents owing to the steady relative fall in the selling prices of the permanganates these are coming into more extensive use but the consumption is still small and they are mainly used for certain special effects chiefly in linen or more generally flax cloth bleaching paperpulp spinningpaper is a continuous web or fabric produced by the interlocking of the structural fibrous units of the wellknown short length in japan and other countries paper is made to serve for all or some of the purposes for which we employ string or twine and to give the necessary tensile strength the paper is twisted or rolled on itself such twisting however adds nothing to the intrinsic tensile qualities of the original paper a new technical effect is realised in this direction by the treatment of paperpulp in the process of its conversion into a continuous web the pulp is formed into continuous strips of convenient breadth usually from 2 to 8 mm these receive a rollingup treatment immediately following the squeeze of the press rolls by which the superfluous water is removed they are then further but incompletely dried and in this condition are subjected to a final spinning or twisting treatment on ringspinning machinery of special construction such a process was originally patented by c kellner in this country ep no 202251891 and is fully described in his specification later improvements in detail were patented by g trk ep 46211892 a joint system is now being industrially developed in germany by the altdammstahlhammer pulp and paper company under the technical direction of dr max mller and there appears to be every prospect of the product taking a position as a staple textile the process has only the incidental interest in connection with our main subject that it employs chiefly the chemical pulps or celluloses as raw materials the industrial future of the application must of course be largely determined by costs of production as the directions of application in the weaving industries will be limited by the necessarily inferior grade of tensile strength belonging to these products and the degree by which this is lowered on complete wetting all these questions have been duly weighed by those engaged in this interesting development and the conclusion of those qualified to judge is that the new industry has vindicated for itself a permanent position ii the chemical derivatives of cellulose in their industrial aspects have come to occupy a profoundly important position in the worlds affairs in the way of any essential alteration of the perspective from that obtaining in 1895 we have nothing to chronicle no new derivatives of industrial importance have been added in that period but certain new methods incidental to the preparation of wellknown compounds or for converting them into more generally available forms have been introduced and these are contributing to the rapid expansion of the artificial cellulose industries of the cellulose esters the nitrates are still the only group in industrial use there uses for explosives have attained immense proportions and their applications for structural purposes are continually on the increase the manufacture of smokeless powders on the one hand and of celluloid and xylonite both in the form of films and solid aggregates on the other has taken no new departure the industry in artificial silks or lustracelluloses by the collodion processes also whilst presenting features of unusual interest attaching to rapid expansion has been barren of contribution of fundamental scientific or technical importance the tetracetate is now manufactured on the large scale but the product has yet to make its market the process of mercerising cotton yarns and cloth has been developed to an industry of colossal dimensions and the growth has been especially rapid during the last five years significant of the technical progress in these two industries with their common aim of appreciating cellulose in the scale of textiles by approximating its external properties in those of silk is the appearance of a monograph of the technology of each notices of which have been previously given pp 2226 there is little doubt however that the question of the future industry in the various forms of cellulose thread film structureless powder or solid aggregate obtainable by artificial means mainly turns upon cost of production irrespective of cost there would no doubt be a market for all these products based upon such of their properties or effects as are indispensable and not otherwise obtainable as an illustration we may cite the extraordinary selling prices of 4050 fr per kilo for the artificial silks collodion process which ruled some three years ago and we may note that for a special application of viscose the dissolved cellulose is paid for at the rate of 10 per lb these facts are certainly worthy of mention and should be borne in mind as an index of some special features of modern manufacturing industry but with a material like cellulose rendered available in a new shape the question which always arises more prominently than that of limited uses at high prices is that of consumption on the extensive scale which marks the older and wellknown products that question is rapidly solving itself in this country as regards the artificial silks there is at present a limited market at 9s10s per lb a price which on the one side excludes extensive consumption and on the other practically bars manufacture in this country by any of the collodion systems it will appear from a very elementary calculation of what we may call the theoretical costs that the above selling price would not have a remunerative margin the theoretical costs are made up of raw materials14 cotton nitrating acid etheralcohol solvent denitrating chemicals a nitrating and preparing collodion denitrating and bleaching labour b textile operations spinning winding and twisting rewinding power making filtering and distributing collodion driving textile machinery added to which are the costs of expert management and supervision and general establishment expenses it is evident that raw materials make up a large fraction of the total cost also that a very large item is the waste work of converting the cellulose into nitrate only to remove the nitric groups so soon as the cellulose is obtained as thread it is clear that the aqueous solutions of cellulose have a double advantage in this respectnot only do they readily yield an approximately pure cellulose as a direct product of regeneration or decomposition but the first cost of the solution is very much less with these newer products therefore the spinning problem enters on a new phase of struggle it is certain that at selling prices at or about 5s to 7s very large markets will be open to the product or products the two processes which are or may be able to fulfil this demand are those based 1 on cuprammonium solutions of cellulose 2 on the sulphocarbonate or viscose as regards first cost of the solution the latter has a large advantage one ton of wood pulp at 12l can certainly be obtained in solution in a condition ready for spinning at a total cost materials of less than 30l the cuprammonium process so far as outside information goes requires for production of the solution 1 cotton as raw material 2 ammonia calc as concentrated aqueous equal to 112 times its weight and 3 metallic copper 25 pct of its weight and the costs are approximately 100l per ton it is obvious that the materials are recoverable from the precipitatingbath but at a certain added cost we have no statements as to the proportion recoverable nor the costs incurred and we are therefore unable to measure the total net cost of the regenerated cellulose by this process it is certainly much less than by the collodion processes as to the textile quality of the thread the product has not yet been on a sufficiently wide selling basis for that to have been determined there are a great many factors which enter here not merely the external characters of lustre softness and translucency but the allimportant quality of uniformity of thread the collodionspinning is a process still very defective in this respect and the defect is no doubt referable to the difficulty of securing absolute physical invariability of the collodion it is to be regretted in the interests of scientific development that none of the technologists who have published investigations of these processes have entered into the discussion of the fundamental factors of the spinning processes we are therefore unable at this stage to discuss these elements of a full comparison in greater detail we cannot for this reason say how far the cuprammonium process diverges in point of control from the standard of the collodion processes of the viscose product we have a more intimate knowledge and it certainly reaches a higher general standard than the older and now wellknown artificial silks the process is also sufficiently developed to enable the total costs of production to be estimated at a figure less than onehalf that of the collodion processes this would assure to this system an entre in this country and a basis of expansion limited only by the ordinary laws of supply and demand this prospect is opened up precisely at the moment when for various reasons connected both with the difficulties of manufacture and the narrowing of the margin of profit the proprietors of the two systems of collodionspinning have decided to abandon all idea of manufacturing by these systems in this country15 we leave the discussion of the industrial problem at this point in regard to other developments based upon the exceptional character and properties of the sulphocarbonate their further discussion will exemplify no general principles and as regards technical detail they have been dealt with in the papers previously noticed as a purely general question if there is to be any industry in these artificial forms of cellulose commensurate with the magnitude that usually belongs to the cellulose industries it must come by way of a plastic or soluble form prepared at low cost and conserving the essential molecular properties of the cellulose aggregate these are the particular features of the sulphocarbonate the obvious difficulties in the way of its industrial applications are those caused by the presence of alkali and sulphur compounds these are dealt with by appropriate chemical means but the fact that there is a special chemistry of the product has rendered its industrial progress slow the work of the last five years in this as in other applications of cellulose in its many derived forms has resulted in a considerable addition to the domain of practical chemistry further developments will make an increasing demand upon our grasp of the fundamental constitutional problems to which it is the main purpose of the present volume to contribute footnotes 11

from estimates we have made the costs of obtaining cotton in filtered solution as collodion multiply its value by 1214 the denitrations adding further costs and raising this multiple to 1820 in the same estimates we arrived at the conclusion that the item for raw materials made up 60 pct of the total cost of the yarn 15 the recent failure of a french company founded for the exploitation of the cuprammonium process may be taken as showing that it presents very considerable technical difficulties it is a matter of common knowledge that this company estimated the costs of production to be such as to enable the product to be sold at 12 fr per kilo whereas the costs actually obtaining were a large multiple of this figure index of authors bardy c h 157 bokorny t 43 bronnert e 54 bumcke g and

archive foundation project gutenberg depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machinereadable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment many small donations 1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united states compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states us laws alone swamp our small staff please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks online payments and credit card donations to donate please visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate section 5 general information about project gutenberg electronic works professor michael s hart was the originator of the project gutenberg concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone for forty years he produced and distributed project gutenberg ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support project gutenberg ebooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the us unless a copyright notice is included thus we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition most people start at our website which has the main pg search facility wwwgutenbergorg this website includes information about project gutenberg including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation how to help produce our new ebooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks
