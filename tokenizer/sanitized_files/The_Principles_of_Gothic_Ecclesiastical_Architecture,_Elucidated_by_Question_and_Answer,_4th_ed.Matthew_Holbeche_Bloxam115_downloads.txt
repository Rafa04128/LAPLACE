the woodcut in this page has been reversed in its position illustration two arches of roman masonry leicester introduction on the origin progress and decline of gothic or english ecclesiastical architecture amongst the vestiges of antiquity which abound in this country are the visible memorials of those nations which have succeeded one another in the occupancy of this island to the age of our celtic ancestors the earliest possessors of its soil is ascribed the erection of those altars and temples of all but primeval antiquity the cromlechs and stone circles which lie scattered over the land and these are conceived to have been derived from the phoenicians whose merchants first introduced amongst the aboriginal britons the arts of incipient civilization of these most ancient relics the prototypes appear as described in holy writ in the pillar raised at bethel by jacob in the altars erected by the patriarchs and in the circles of stone set up by moses at the foot of mount sinai and by joshua at gilgal many of these structures perhaps from their very rudeness have survived the vicissitudes of time whilst there scarce remains a vestige of the temples erected in this island by the romans yet it is from roman edifices that we derive and can trace by a gradual transition the progress of that peculiar kind of architecture called gothic which presents in its later stages the most striking contrast that can be imagined to its original precursor the romans having conquered almost the whole of britain in the first century retained possession of the southern parts for nearly four hundred years and during their occupancy they not only instructed the natives in the arts of civilization but also with their aid as we learn from tacitus began at an early period to erect temples and public edifices though doubtless much inferior to those at rome in their municipal towns and cities the christian religion was also early introduced3 but for a time its progress was slow nor was it till the conversion of constantine in the fourth century that it was openly tolerated by the state and churches were publicly constructed for its worshippers though even before that event as we are led to infer from the testimony of gildas the most ancient of our native historians particular structures were appropriated for the performance of its divine mysteries for that historian alludes to the british christians as reconstructing the churches which had in the dioclesian persecution been levelled to the ground but in the fifth century rome oppressed on every side by enemies and distracted with the vastness of her conquests which she was no longer able to maintain recalled her legions from britain and the romanized britons being left without protection and having during their subjection to the romans lost their ancient valour and love of liberty in a short time fell a prey to the northern barbarians in their extremity they called over the saxons to assist them when the latter perceiving their defenceless condition turned round upon them and made an easy conquest of this country in the struggle which then took place the churches were again destroyed the priests were slain at the very altars4 and though the british church was never annihilated paganism for a while became triumphant towards the end of the sixth century when christianity was again propagated in this country by augustine mellitus and other zealous monks st gregory the head of the papal church and the originator of this mission wrote to mellitus not to suffer the heathen temples to be destroyed but only the idols found within them these and such churches built by the romans as were then though in a dilapidated state existing may reasonably be supposed to have been the prototypes of the christian churches afterwards erected in this country in the early period of the empire the romans imitated the grecians in their buildings of magnitude and beauty forming however a style of greater richness in detail though less chaste in effect and columns of the different orders with their entablatures were used to support and adorn their public structures but in the fourth century when the arts were declining the style of architecture became debased and the predominant features consisted of massive square piers or columns without entablatures from the imposts of which sprung arches of a semicircular form and it was in rude imitation of this latter style that the saxon churches were constructed the roman basilicas or halls of justice some of which were subsequently converted into churches to which also their names were given furnished the plan for the internal arrangement of churches of a large size being divided in the interior by rows of columns from this division the nave and aisles of a church were derived and in the semicircular recess at the one end for the tribune we perceive the origin of the apsis or semicircular east end which one of the anglosaxon and many of our ancient norman churches still present but independent of examples afforded by some few ancient roman churches and such of the temples and public buildings of the romans as were then remaining in britain the saxon converts were directed and assisted in the science of architecture by those missionaries from rome who propagated christianity amongst them and during the saxon dynasty architects and workmen were frequently procured from abroad to plan and raise ecclesiastical structures the anglosaxon churches were however rudely built and as far as can be ascertained with some few exceptions were of no great dimensions and almost entirely devoid of ornamental mouldings though in some instances decorative sculpture and mouldings are to be met with but in the repeated incursions of the danes in the ninth and tenth centuries so general was the destruction of the monasteries and churches which when the country became tranquil were rebuilt by the normans that we have in fact comparatively few churches existing which we may reasonably presume or really know to have been erected in an anglosaxon age many of the earlier writers on this subject have however caused much confusion by applying the term saxon to all churches and other edifices contradistinguished from the pointed style by semicircularheaded doorways windows and arches but the vestiges of anglosaxon architecture have been as yet so little studied or known as to render it difficult to point out either generally or in detail in what their peculiarities consist the style may however be said to have approximated in appearance much nearer to the debased roman style of masonry than the norman and to have been also much ruder and in the most ancient churches as in that at dover castle and that at bricksworth we find arches constructed of flat bricks or tiles set edgewise which was also a roman fashion the masonry was chiefly composed of rubble with ashlar or squared blocks of stone at the angles disposed in courses in a peculiar manner illustration anglosaxon arches bricksworth church northamptonshire 7th cent the most common characteristic by which the norman style is distinguished is the semicircular or segmental arch though this is to be met with also in the rare specimens of anglosaxon masonry but the norman arches were more scientifically constructed in their early state indeed quite plain but generally concentric or one arch receding within another and in an advanced stage they were frequently ornamented with zigzag and other mouldings a variety of mouldings were also used in the decoration of the norman portals or doorways which were besides often enriched with a profusion of sculptured ornament the norman churches appear to have much excelled in size the lowly structures of the saxons and the cathedral and conventual churches were frequently carried to the height of three tiers or rows of arches one above another blank arcades were also used to ornament the walls illustration norman arcade st aldgate oxford the norman style in which an innumerable number of churches and monastic edifices were originally built or entirely reconstructed continued without any striking alteration till about the latter part of the twelfth century when a singular change began to take place this was no other than the introduction of the pointed arch the origin of which has never yet been satisfactorily explained or the precise period clearly ascertained in which it first appeared but as the lightness and simplicity of design to which the early pointed style was found to be afterwards convertible was in its incipient state unknown it retained to the close of the twelfth century the heavy concomitants of the semicircular arch with which indeed it was often intermixed and from such intermixture it may be designated the semi or mixed norman when the original norman style of building was first broken through by the introduction of the pointed arch which was often formed by the intersection of semicircular arches the facing of it or architrave was often ornamented with the zigzag billet and other mouldings in the same manner as the norman semicircular arches it also rested on round massive piers and still retained many other features of norman architecture but from the time of its introduction to the close of the twelfth century the pointed arch was gradually struggling with the semicircular arch for the mastery and with success for from the commencement of the thirteenth century as nearly as can be ascertained the style of building with semicircular arches was with very few exceptions altogether discarded and superseded by its more elegant rival illustration canterbury cathedral the mode of building with semicircular arches massive piers and thick walls with broad pilaster buttresses was now laid aside and the pointed arch supported by more slender piers with walls strengthened with graduating buttresses of less width but of greater projection were universally substituted in their stead the windows one of the most apparent marks of distinction were at first long narrow and lancetshaped the heavy norman ornaments the zigzag and other mouldings peculiar to the norman and seminorman styles were now discarded yet we often meet with certain decorative ornaments as the tooth ornament which though sometimes found in late norman work is almost peculiar to the early pointed style also the ballflower prevalent both in this and the style of the succeeding century many church towers were also capped with spires which now first appear this style prevailed generally throughout the thirteenth century and is usually designated as the early english illustration horsley ch derbyshire towards the close of the thirteenth century a perceptible though gradual transition took place to a richer and more ornamental mode of architecture this was the style of the fourteenth century and is known by the name of the decorated english but it chiefly flourished during the reigns of edward the second and edward the third in the latter of which it attained a degree of perfection unequalled by preceding or subsequent ages some of the most prominent and distinctive marks of this style occur in the windows which were greatly enlarged and divided into many lights by mullions or tracerybars running into various ramifications above and dividing the heads into numerous compartments forming either geometrical or flowing tracery triangular or pedimental canopies and pinnacles more enriched than before with crockets and finials yet without redundancy of ornament also occur in the churches built during this century illustration worstead church norfolk in the latter part of the fourteenth century another transition or gradual change of style began to be effected in the discrimination of which an obvious distinction again occurs in the composition of the windows some of which are very large for the mullionbars instead of branching off in the head in a number of curved lines are carried up vertically so as to form perpendicular divisions between the windowsill and the head and do not present that combination of geometrical and flowing tracery observable in the style immediately preceding illustration st michaels oxford the frequent occurrence of panelled compartments and the partial change of form in the arches especially of doorways and windows which in the latter part of the fifteenth century were often obtusely pointed and mathematically described from four centres instead of two as in the more simple pointed arch and which from the period when this arch began to be prevalent was called the tudor arch together with a great profusion of minute ornament mostly of a description not before in use are the chief characteristics of the style of the fifteenth century which by some of the earlier writers was designated as the florid though it has since received the more general appellation of the perpendicular this style prevailed till the reformation at which period no country could vie with our own in the number of religious edifices which had been erected in all the varieties of style that had prevailed for many preceding ages next to the magnificent cathedrals the venerable monasteries and collegiate establishments which had been founded and sumptuously endowed in every part of the kingdom might most justly claim the preeminence and many of the churches belonging to them were deservedly held in admiration for their grandeur and architectural elegance of design but the suppression of the monasteries tended in no slight degree to hasten the decline and fall of our ancient church architecture to which other causes such as the revival of the classic orders in italy also contributed the churches belonging to the conventual foundations which had been built at different periods by the monks or their benefactors and the charges of erecting and decorating which from time to time in the most costly manner had been defrayed out of the monastic revenues and from private donations being seized by the crown were reduced to a state of ruin and the sites on which they stood granted to dependants of the court the former reverential feeling on these matters had greatly changed and as the retention of some few of the ministerial habits the square cap the cope the surplice and hood which were deemed expedient for the decent ministration of public worship gave great offence to many and was one of the most apparent causes which led to that schism amongst the reformers on points of discipline which afterwards ended in the subversion for a time of the rites and ordinances of the church of england any attempt towards beautifying and adorning other than with carved pulpits and communiontables or altars the places of divine worship which were now stripped of many of their former ornamental accessories would have been regarded and inveighed against as a popish and superstitious innovation and a charge of this kind was at a later period preferred against archbishop laud parochial churches were therefore now repaired when fallen into a state of dilapidation in a plain and inelegant mode in complete variance with the richness and display observable in the style just preceding this event details originating from the designs of classic architecture which had been partially revived in italy began early in the sixteenth century to make their appearance in this country though as yet except on tombs and in woodwork we observe few of those peculiar features introduced as accessories in church architecture hence many of our country churches which were repaired or partly rebuilt in the century succeeding the reformation exhibit the marks of the style justly denominated debased to distinguish it from the former purer styles depressed and nearly flat arched doorways with shallow mouldings squareheaded windows with perpendicular mullions and obtusepointed or roundheaded lights without foliations together with a general clumsiness of construction as compared with more ancient edifices form the predominating features in ecclesiastical buildings of this kind and in the reign of charles the first an indiscriminate mixture of debased gothic and roman architecture prevailing we lose sight of every true feature of our ancient ecclesiastical styles which were superseded by that which sprang more immediately from the antique the roman or italian mode footnotes 3 tempore ut scimus summo tiberii csaris cgildas 4 ruebant dificia publica simul et privata passim sacerdotes inter altaria trucibanturbede eccl hist lib i c xv illustration scutcheon from beauchamp chapel warwick circa a d 1450 chapter i definition of gothic architecture its origin and the division of it into styles q what is meant by the term gothic architecture a without entering into the derivation of the word gothic it may suffice to state that it is an expression sometimes used to denote in one general term and distinguish from the antique those peculiar modes or styles in which most of our ecclesiastical and many of our domestic edifices of the middle ages have been built in a more confined sense it comprehends those styles only in which the pointed arch predominates and it is then often used to distinguish such from the more ancient anglosaxon and norman styles q to what can the origin of this kind of architecture be traced a to the classic orders in that state of degeneracy into which they had fallen in the age of constantine and afterwards and as the romans on their voluntary abandonment of britain in the fifth century left many of their temples and public edifices remaining together with some christian churches it was in rude imitation of the roman structures of the fourth century that the most ancient of our anglosaxon churches were constructed this is apparent from an examination and comparison of such with the vestiges of roman buildings we have existing q into how many different styles may english ecclesiastical architecture be divided a no specific regulation has been adopted with regard to the denomination or division of the several styles in which all the writers on the subject agree but they may be divided into seven which together with the periods when they flourished may be generally defined as follows the saxon or anglosaxon style which prevailed from the mission of augustine at the close of the sixth to the middle of the eleventh century the norman style which may be said to have prevailed generally from the middle of the eleventh to the latter part of the twelfth century the seminorman or transition style which appears to have prevailed during the latter part of the twelfth century the early english or general style of the thirteenth century the decorated english or general style of the fourteenth century the florid or perpendicular english the style of the fifteenth and early part of the sixteenth century the debased english or general style of the latter part of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth century towards the middle of which gothic architecture even in its debased state became entirely discarded q what constitutes the difference of these styles a they may be distinguished partly by the form of the arches which are triangularheaded semicircular or segmental simple pointed and complex pointed though such forms are by no means an invariable criterion of any particular style by the size and shape of the windows and the manner in which they are subdivided or not by transoms mullions and tracery but more especially by certain minute details ornamental accessories and mouldings more or less peculiar to particular styles and which are seldom to be met with in any other q are the majority of our ecclesiastical buildings composed only of one style a most of our cathedral and country churches have been built or had additions made to them at different periods and therefore seldom exhibit an uniformity of design and many churches have details about them of almost every style there are however numerous exceptions where churches have been erected in the same style throughout and this is more particularly observable in the churches of the fifteenth century q were they constructed on any regular plan a the general ground plan of cathedral and conventual churches was after the form of a cross and the edifice consisted of a central tower with transepts running north and south westward of the tower was the nave or main body of the structure with lateral aisles and the west front contained the principal entrance and was often flanked by towers eastward of the central tower was the choir where the principal service was performed with aisles on each side and beyond this was the lady chapel sometimes the design also comprehended other chapels on the north or south side was the chapter house in early times quadrangular but afterwards octagonal in plan and on the same side in most instances though not always were the cloisters which communicated immediately with the church and surrounded a quadrangular court the chapter house and cloisters we still find remaining as adjuncts to most cathedral churches though the conventual buildings of a domestic nature with which the cloisters formerly also communicated have generally been destroyed mere parochial churches have commonly a tower at the west end a nave with lateral aisles and a chancel some churches have transepts and small side chapels or additional aisles have been annexed to many erected at the costs of individuals to serve for burial and as chantries the smallest class of churches have a nave and chancel only with a small bellturret formed of wooden shingles or an open arch of stonework appearing above the roof at the west end illustration sedilia st martins leicester circa a d 1250 chapter ii of the different kinds of arches q do the distinctions of the different styles as they differ from each other depend at all upon the form of the arch a to a certain extent the form of the arch may be considered as a criterion of style too much dependence however must not be placed on this rule inasmuch as there are many exceptions q how are arches divided generally as to form a into the triangularheaded or straightlined pointed arch the roundheaded arch and the curvedpointed arch and the latter are again subdivided q how is the triangularheaded or straightlined pointed arch formed and when did it prevail a it may be described as formed by the two upper sides of a triangle more or less obtuse or acute it is generally considered as one of the characteristics of the anglosaxon style where it is often to be met with of plain and rude construction but instances of this form of arch though they are not frequent are to be met with in the norman and subsequent styles arches however of this description of late date may be generally known by some moulding or other feature peculiar to the style in which it is used illustration q what different kinds of roundheaded arches are there a the semicircular arch fig 1 the stilted arch fig 2 the segmental arch fig 3 and the horseshoe arch fig 4 illustration q how are they formed or described a the semicircular arch is described from a centre in the same line with its spring the stilted arch in the same manner but the sides are carried downwards in a straight line below the spring of the curve till they rest upon the imposts the segmental arch is described from a centre lower than its spring and the horseshoe arch from a centre placed above its spring q during what period of time do we find these arches generally in use a the semicircular arch which is the most common we find to have prevailed from the time of the romans to the close of the twelfth century when it became generally discarded and we seldom meet with it again in its simple state till about the middle of the sixteenth century it is in some degree considered as a characteristic of the anglosaxon and norman styles the stilted arch is chiefly found in conjunction with the semicircular arch in the construction of norman vaulting over a space in plan that of a parallelogram the segmental arch we meet with in almost all the styles used as an arch of construction and for doorway and window arches whilst the form of the horseshoe arch seems in many instances to have been occasioned by the settlement and inclination of the piers from which it springs q into how many classes may the pointed arch be divided a into two namely the simple pointed arch described from two centres and the complex pointed arch described from four centres q what are the different kinds of simple pointed arches a the lancet or acutepointed arch the equilateral pointed arch and the obtuseangled pointed arch q how is the lancet arch formed and described a it is formed of two segments of a circle and its centres have a radius or line longer than the breadth of the arch and may be described from an acuteangled triangle fig 5tn1 q how is the equilateral arch formed and described a from two segments of a circle the centres of it have a radius or line equal to the breadth of the arch and it may be described from an equilateral triangle fig 6 illustration q how is the obtuseangled arch formed and described a like the foregoing it is formed from two segments of a circle and the centres of it have a radius shorter than the breadth of the arch it is described from an obtuseangled triangle fig 7 q during what period were these pointed arches in use a they were all gradually introduced in the twelfth century and continued during the thirteenth century after which the lancet arch appears to have been generally discarded though the other two prevailed till a much later period q what are the different kinds of complex pointed arches a those commonly called the ogee or contrasted arch and the tudor arch q how is the ogee or contrasted arch formed and described a it is formed of four segments of a circle and is described from four centres two placed within the arch on a level with the spring and two placed on the exterior of the arch and level with the apex or point fig 8 each side is composed of a double curve the lowermost convex and the uppermost concave illustration q when was the ogee arch introduced and how long did it prevail a it was introduced early in the fourteenth century and continued till the close of the fifteenth century q how is the tudor arch described a from four centres two on a level with the spring and two at a distance from it and below fig 9 q when was the tudor arch introduced and why is it so called a it was introduced about the middle of the fifteenth century or perhaps earlier but became most prevalent during the reigns of henry the seventh and henry the eighth under the tudor dynasty from which it derives its name illustration q what other kinds of arches are there worthy of notice a those which are called foiled arches as the roundheaded trefoil fig 10 the pointed trefoil fig 11 and the squareheaded trefoil fig 12 the first prevailed in the latter part of the twelfth and early part of the thirteenth century chiefly as a heading for niches or blank arcades the second used for the same purpose we find to have prevailed in the thirteenth century and the latter is found in doorways of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in all these the exterior mouldings follow the same curvatures as the inner mouldings and are thus distinguishable from arches the heads of which are only foliated within illustration doorway st thomass oxford circa 1250 illustration anglosaxon doorway brixworth church northamptonshire 7th cent chapter iii of the anglosaxon style q during what period of time did this style prevail a from the close of the sixth century when the conversion of the anglosaxons commenced to the middle of the eleventh century q whence does this style appear to have derived its origin a from the later roman edifices for in the most ancient of the anglosaxon remains we find an approximation more or less to the roman mode of building with arches formed of brickwork q what is peculiar in the constructive features of roman masonry a walls of roman masonry in this country were chiefly constructed of stone or flint according to the part of the country in which the one material or other prevailed embedded in mortar bonded at certain intervals throughout with regular horizontal courses or layers of large flat roman bricks or tiles which from the inequality of thickness and size do not appear to have been shaped in any regular mould illustration portion of the fragment of a roman building at leicester q what vestiges of roman masonry are now existing in britain a a fragment apparently that of a roman temple or basilica near the church of st nicholas at leicester which contains horizontal courses of brick at intervals and arches constructed of brickwork the curious portion of a wall of similar construction with remains of brick arches on the one side which indicate it to have formed part of a building and not a mere wall as it now appears at wroxeter salop and the polygonal tower at dover castle which notwithstanding an exterior casing of flint and other alterations effected in the fifteenth century still retains many visible features of its original construction of tufa bonded with bricks at intervals roman masonry of the mixed description of brick and stone regularly disposed is found in walls at york lincoln silchester and elsewhere and sometimes we meet with bricks or stone arranged herringbone fashion as in the vestiges of a roman building at castor northamptonshire and the walls of a roman villa discovered at littleton somersetshire q have we any remains of the ancient british churches erected in this country in the third fourth or fifth centuries a none such have yet been discovered or noticed for the ruinous structure at perranzabuloe in cornwall which some assert to have been an ancient british church is probably not of earlier date than the twelfth century and the church of st martin at canterbury built in the time of the romans which augustine found on his arrival still used for the worship of god was rebuilt in the thirteenth century but to all appearance with the same materials of which the original church was constructed q do any of our churches bear a resemblance to roman buildings a the church now in ruins within the precincts of the castle of dover presents features of early work approximating roman as a portal and windowarches formed of brickwork which seem to have been copied from those in the roman tower near adjoining the walls also have much of roman brick worked up into them but have no such regular horizontal layers as roman masonry displays the most ancient portions of this church are attributed to belong to the middle of the seventh century the church of brixworth northamptonshire is perhaps the most complete specimen we have existing of an early anglosaxon church it has had side aisles separated from the nave by semicircular arches constructed of roman bricks with wide joints these arches spring from square and plain massive piers there is also fair recorded evidence to support the inference that this church is a structure of the latter part of the seventh century roman bricks are worked up in the walls in no regular order however but indiscriminately as in the church at dover castle illustration pilaster ribwork arch brigstock church q what peculiarities are observable in masonry of anglosaxon construction a from existing vestiges of churches of presumed anglosaxon construction it appears that the walls were chiefly formed of rubble or ragstone covered on the exterior with stucco or plaster with long and short blocks of ashlar or hewn stone disposed at the angles in alternate courses we also find projecting a few inches from the surface of the wall and running up vertically narrow ribs or squareedged strips of stone bearing from their position a rude similarity to pilasters and these strips are generally composed of long and short pieces of stone placed alternately a plain string course of the same description of squareedged rib or stripwork often runs horizontally along the walls of anglosaxon remains and the vertical ribs are sometimes set upon such as a basement and sometimes finish under such q what churches exhibit projecting strips of stonework thus disposed a the towers of the churches of earls barton and barnack northamptonshire and the tower of one of the churches at bartonuponhumber lincolnshire are covered with these narrow projecting strips of stonework in such a manner that the surface of the wall appears divided into rudely formed panels the like disposition of ribwork appears though not to so great extent on the face of the upper part of the tower of stowe church northamptonshire of st benedicts church cambridge on the walls of the church of worth in sussex on the upper part of the walls of the chancel of repton church derbyshire and on the walls of the nave and north transept of stanton lacey church salop illustration anglosaxon masonry long and short work burcombe wilts wittering northamptonshire q where do we meet with instances where long and short blocks of ashlar masonry are disposed in alternate courses at the angles of walls a such occur at the angles of the chancel of north burcombe church wiltshire at the angles of the nave and chancel of wittering church northamptonshire at the angles of the towers of st benedicts church cambridge of sompting church sussex and of st michaels church oxford and in other anglosaxon remains the ashlar masonry forming the angles is not however invariably thus disposed q how are the doorways of this style distinguished a they are either semicircular or triangulararched headed but the former are more common in those apparently the most ancient the voussoirs or arched heads are faced with large flat bricks or tiles closely resembling roman work doorways of this description are to be met with in the old church dover castle in the church of brixworth northamptonshire and on the south side of brytford church wiltshire the doorway however we most frequently meet with in anglosaxon remains is of simple yet peculiar construction semicircularheaded and formed entirely of stone without any admixture of brick the jambs are squareedged and are sometimes but not always composed of two long blocks placed upright with a short block between them the arched head of the doorway is plain and springs from square projecting impost blocks the under edges of which are sometimes bevelled and sometimes left square this doorway is contained within a kind of arch of ribwork projecting from the face of the wall with strips of pilaster ribwork continued down to the ground sometimes this arch springs from plain block imposts or from strips of squareedged ribwork disposed horizontally and the jambs are occasionally constructed of long and short work illustration anglosaxon doorway st peters church bartonuponhumber q mention the names of churches in which doorways of this description are preserved a the south doorways of the towers of the old church at bartonuponhumber and of barnack church the west doorway of the tower of earls barton church the north and south doorways of the tower of wooten wawen church warwickshire the east doorway of the tower of stowe church northamptonshire the north doorway of the nave of brytford church wiltshire and the north doorway of the nave of stanton lacey church salop though differing in some respects from each other bear a general similarity of design and come under the foregoing description illustration belfry window north side of the tower of wyckham church berks q how are we able to distinguish the windows of the anglosaxon style a the belfry windows are generally found to consist of two semicircularheaded lights divided by a kind of rude balluster shaft of peculiar character the entasis of which is sometimes encircled with rude annulated mouldings this shaft supports a plain oblong impost or abacus which extends through the whole of the thickness of the wall or nearly so and from this one side of the arch of each light springs double windows thus divided appear in the belfry stories of the church towers of st michael oxford st benedict cambridge st peter bartonuponhumber wyckham berks sompting sussex and northleigh oxfordshire in the belfry of the tower of earls barton church are windows of five or six lights the divisions between which are formed by these curious balluster shafts the semicircularheaded singlelight window of this style may be distinguished from those of the norman style by the double splay of the jambs the spaces between which spread or increase in width outwardly as well as inwardly the narrowest part of the window being placed on the centre of the thickness of the wall whereas the jambs of windows in the norman style have only a single splay and the narrowest part of the window is set even with the external face of the wall or nearly so singlelight windows splayed externally occur in the west walls of the towers of wyckham church berks and of stowe church northamptonshire caversfield church oxfordshire and on the north side of the chancel of clapham church bedfordshire but windows without a splay occur in the tower of lavendon church buckinghamshire small square or oblongshaped apertures are sometimes met with as in the tower of st benedicts church cambridge and also triangularheaded windows which with doorways of the same form will be presently noticed illustration anglosaxon singlelight window tower of wyckham church berks q of what description are the arches which separate the nave from the chancel and aisles and sustain the clerestory walls illustration anglosaxon arches st michaels church st albans a d 948 a they are very plain and consist of a single sweep or soffit only without any subarch as in the norman style and they spring from square piers with a plain abacus impost on each intervening which impost has sometimes the under edge chamfered and sometimes left quite plain arches of this description occur at brixworth church between the nave and chancel of clapham church and between the nave and chancel of wyckham church the arches in st michaels church st albans which divide the nave from the aisles have their edges slightly chamfered there are also arches with single soffits which have over them a kind of hood similar to that over doorways of squareedged ribwork projecting a few inches from the face of the wall carried round the arch and either dying into the impost or continued straight down to the ground the chancel arch of worth church and arches in the churches of brigstock and barnack and of st benedict cambridge and the chancel arch barrow church salop are of this description some arches have round or semicylindrical mouldings rudely worked on the face as in the chancel arch wittering church or under or attached to the soffit as at the churches of sompting and st botulph sussex rudely sculptured impost blocks also sometimes occur as at sompting and at st botulph and animals sculptured in low relief appear at the springing of the hood over the arch in the tower of st benedicts church cambridge illustration tower arch barnack church northamptonshire illustration chancel arch wittering church northamptonshire q how are some of the doorways windows arched recesses and panels of anglosaxon architecture constructed illustration doorway in the tower of brigstock church a in a very rude manner of two or more long blocks of stone placed slantingly or inclined one towards the other thus forming a straight line or triangularheaded arch the lower ends of these sometimes rest on plain projecting imposts which surmount other blocks composing the jambs we find a doorway of this description on the west side of the tower of brigstock church forming the entrance into the curious circularshaped turret attached and designed for a staircase to the belfry an arched recess of this description occurs in the tower of barnack church and a panel on the exterior of the same tower and in windows in the tower of the old church bartonuponhumber and in the tower of sompting church and st michaels church oxford the arch thus shaped is not however peculiar to the anglosaxon style but may occasionally be traced in most if not all of the subsequent styles but not of such rude or plain construction illustration recess in the tower of barnack church q were the anglosaxon architects accustomed to construct crypts beneath their churches a there are some subterranean vaults not easily accessible the presumed remains of bishop wilfrids work at ripon and hexham of the latter part of the seventh century but the crypt beneath the chancel of repton church derbyshire the walls of which are constructed of hewn stone is perhaps the most perfect specimen existing of a crypt in the anglosaxon style and of a stone vaulted roof sustained by piers which are of singular character the vaulting is without diagonal groins and bears a greater similarity to roman than to norman vaulting illustration crypt repton church derbyshire q are mouldings or is any kind of sculptured ornament to be met with in anglosaxon work a although the remains of this style are for the most part plain and devoid of ornamental detail we occasionally meet with mouldings of a semicylindrical or rolllike form on the face or under the soffit of an arch and these are sometimes continued down the sides of the jambs or piers foliage knotwork and other rudely sculptured detail occur on the tower of barnack church and some rude sculptures appear in st benedicts church cambridge and the plain and simple cross of the greek form is represented in relief over a doorway at stanton lacey church and over windows in the tower of earls barton church q what was the general plan of the anglosaxon churches a we have now but few instances in which the complete ground plan of an anglosaxon church can be traced that of worth church sussex is perhaps the most perfect as the original foundation walls do not appear to have been disturbed although insertions of windows of later date have been made in the walls of the superstructure this church is planned in the form of a cross and consists of a nave with transepts and a chancel terminating at the east end with a semicircular apsisa rare instance in the anglosaxon style as in general the east end of the chancel is rectangular in plan the towers of anglosaxon churches are generally placed at the west end though sometimes as at wotten wawen they occur between the chancel and nave no original staircase has yet been found in the interior of any the church at brixworth an edifice of the seventh century and that of st michael at st albans of the tenth century have aisles sometimes the church appears to have consisted of a nave and chancel only q why have we so few ecclesiastical remains of known or presumed anglosaxon architecture now existing a there are probably many examples of this style preserved in churches which have hitherto escaped observation49 still they are comparatively speaking rarely to be met with and this may be accounted for by the recorded fact that in the repeated incursions of the danes in this island during the ninth and tenth centuries almost all the anglosaxon monasteries and churches were set on fire and destroyed illustration anglo saxon doorway and window interior of the tower of brigstock church north side footnotes 49 all the anglosaxon remains noticed in this chapter except those alluded to as supposed to exist at ripon and hexham together with the tower of the church of st benedicts lincoln have been inspected by the author and the illustrations of this chapter are with three exceptions from his sketches made on the spot of the remaining three vignettes two are from drawings made whilst the author was present and one only viz that of the crypt beneath the chancel of repton church has been reduced from a larger engraving besides the churches which have been referred to several others which have not been visited by the author exhibit vestiges more or less of presumed anglosaxon work of such churches the following is a

noticed by mr rickman illustration norman chancel darent church kent chapter iv of the norman or anglonorman style q to what era may we assign the introduction of the anglonorman style a to the reign of edward the confessor since that monarch is recorded by the historians matthew paris and william of malmesbury to have rebuilt a d 1065 the abbey church at westminster in a new style of architectural design which furnished an example afterwards followed by many in the construction of churches52 q is any portion of the structure erected by edward the confessor remaining a a crypt of early norman work under the present edifice or buildings attached to it is supposed to have been part of the church constructed by that monarch q during what period of time did this style prevail a from about a d 1065 to the close of the twelfth century q by what means are we to distinguish this style from the styles of a later period a it is distinguished without difficulty by its semicircular arches its massive piers which are generally square or cylindrical though sometimes multangular in form and from numerous ornamental details and mouldings peculiar to the style q what part of the original building has generally been preserved in those churches that were built by the normans when all the rest has been demolished and rebuilt in a later style of architecture illustration norman doorway wolston church warwickshire a there appears to have been a prevalent custom among those architects who succeeded the normans to preserve the doorways of those churches they rebuilt or altered for many such doorways still remain in churches the other portions of which were built at a much later period thus in the tower of kenilworth church warwickshire is a norman doorway of singular design from the square band or ornamental facia which environs it this is a relic of a more ancient edifice than the structure in which it now appears and which is of the fourteenth century and the external masonry of the doorway is not tied into the walls of more recent construction but exhibits a break all round the church of stoneleigh in the same county contains in the north wall a fine norman doorway which has been left undisturbed though the wall on each side of norman construction has been altered not by demolition but by the insertion in the fourteenth century of decorated windows in lieu of the original small norman lights q were the norman doorways much ornamented a many rich doorways were composed of a succession of receding semicircular arches springing from rectangularedged jambs and detached shafts with capitals in the nooks which shafts together with the arches were often enriched with the mouldings common to this style sometimes the sweep of mouldings which faced the architrave was continued without intermission down the jambs or sides of the doorway and in small country churches norman doorways quite plain in their construction or with but few mouldings are to be met with there is perhaps a greater variety of design in doorways of this than of any other style and of the numerous mouldings with which they in general abound more or less the chevron or zigzag appears to have been the most common q in what other respect were these doors sometimes ornamented a the semicircularshaped stone which we often find in the tympanum at the back of the head of the arch is generally covered with rude sculpture in basso relievo sometimes representing a scriptural subject as the temptation of our first parents on the tympanum of a norman doorway at thurley church bedfordshire sometimes a legend as a curious and very early sculpture over the south door of fordington church dorsetshire representing a scene in the story of st george and sometimes symbolical as the representation of fish serpents and chimer on the north doorway of stoneleigh church warwickshire the figure of our saviour in a sitting attitude holding in his left hand a book and with his right arm and hand upheld in allusion to the saying i am the way and the truth and the life and circumscribed by that mystical figure the vesica piscis appears over norman doorways at ely cathedral rochester cathedral malmesbury abbey church elstow church bedfordshire water stratford church buckinghamshire and barfreston church kent and is not uncommon q are there many norman porches a norman porches occur at durham cathedral malmesbury abbey church sherbourne abbey church and witney church oxfordshire but they are not very common the roof of the porch was usually groined with simple cross springers and moulded ribs and in some instances a room over has been added at a later period numerous portals of the norman era appear constructed within a shallow projecting mass of masonry similar in appearance to the broad projecting buttress and like that finished on the upper edge with a plain slope this was to give a sufficiency of depth to the numerous concentric arches successively receding in the thickness of the wall which could not otherwise be well attained q what kind of windows were those belonging to this style a the windows were mostly small and narrow seldom of more than one light except belfry windows which were usually divided into two roundheaded lights by a shaft with a capital and abacus early in the style the windows were quite plain afterwards they were ornamented in a greater or less degree sometimes with the chevron or zigzag and sometimes with roll or cylinder mouldings in many instances also shafts were inserted at the sides the window jambs were simply splayed in one direction only and the space between them increased in width inwardly illustration norman window ryton church warwickshire q do we meet with any circular or wheelshaped windows of the norman era a a circular window with divisions formed by small shafts and semicircular or trefoiled arches disposed so as to converge to a common centre sometimes occurs in the gable at the east end of a norman church as at barfreston church kent and new shoreham church sussex and are not uncommon illustration early norman window darent church kent with incipient zigzag moulding q what kinds of piers were the norman piers a early in the style they were with some exceptions as in the crypts beneath the cathedrals of canterbury and worcester very massive and the generality plain and cylindrical though sometimes they were square which was indeed the most ancient shape sometimes they appear with rectangular nooks or recesses and in large churches norman piers had frequently one or more semicylindrical piershafts attached disposed either in nooks or on the face of the pier we sometimes meet with octagonal piers as in the cathedrals of oxford and peterborough the conventual church at ely and in the ruined church of buildwas abbey salop and also though rarely with piers covered with spiral flutings as one is in norwich cathedral with the spiral cable moulding as one is in the crypt of canterbury cathedral and encircled with a spiral band as one appears in the ruined chapel at orford in suffolk sometimes also they appear covered with ornamental mouldings late in the style the piers assume a greater lightness in appearance and are sometimes clustered and banded round with mouldings and approximate in design those of a subsequent style q how are the capitals distinguished a the general outline and shape of the norman capital is that of a square cubical mass having the lower part rounded off with a contour resembling that of an ovolo moulding the face on each side of the upper part of the capital is flat and it is often separated from the lower part by an escalloped edge and where such division is formed by more than one escallop the lower part is channelled between each and the spaces below the escalloped edges are worked or moulded so as to resemble inverted and truncated semicones illustration norman capital steetley church derbyshire besides the plain capital thus described of which instances with the single escalloped edge occur in the crypts beneath the cathedrals of canterbury winchester and worcester and with a series of escalloped edges or what would be heraldically termed invected in many of the capitals of the norman piers in norwich cathedral an extreme variety of design in ornamental accessories prevail the general form and outline of the capital being preserved and some exhibit imitations of the ionic volute and corinthian acanthus whilst many are covered with rude sculpture in relief they are generally finished with a plain square abacus moulding with the under edge simply bevelled or chamfered sometimes a slight angular moulding occurs between the upper face and slope of the abacus and sometimes the abacus alone intervenes between the pier and the spring of the arch there are also many round capitals as for instance those in the nave of gloucester cathedral but they are mostly late in the style illustration norman arcade st augustines canterbury q what is observable in the bases of the piers a the common base moulding resembles in form or contour a quirked ovolo reversed there are however many exceptions illustration norman base romsey church hants q how are the arches distinguished a by their semicircular form they are generally doublefaced or formed of two concentric divisions one receding within the other early in the style they are plain and squareedged late in the style they are often found enriched with the zigzag and roll mouldings or some other ornament sometimes the curvature of the arch does not immediately spring from the capital or impost but is raised or stilted q what parts of norman churches do we generally find vaulted a in cathedral and large conventual churches built in the norman style we find the crypts and aisles vaulted with stone but not the nave or choir and over the vaulting of the aisles was the triforium in small norman churches the chancel is generally the only part vaulted and between the vaulting and outer roof is in some instances a small loft or chamber sometimes we find the original design for vaulting to have been commenced and left unfinished illustration norman arch and piers melbourne church derbyshire q of what description was the norman vaulting a the bays of vaulting were generally either squares or parallelograms though sometimes not rectangular in shape and each was divided into four concave vaulting cells by diagonal and intersecting groins thus forming what is called a quadripartite vault early in the style the diagonal edges of the groins appear without ribs or mouldings at an advanced stage they are supported by squareedged ribs of cut stone and late in the style the ribs and groins are faced with roll or cylinder mouldings they are also sometimes profusely covered with the zigzag moulding and other ornamental details q what is observable with respect to norman masonry a in general the walls are faced on each side with a thin shell of ashlar or cut stone whilst the intervening space which is sometimes considerable is filled with grouted rubble masses of this groutwork masonry from which the facing of cut stone has been removed we often find amongst ruined edifices of early date q were there any buttresses used at this period illustration norman buttress chancel of st marys leicester a yes but the walls being enormously thick and requiring little additional support those in use are like pilasters with a broad face projecting very little from the building and they seem to have been derived from the pilaster strips of stonework in anglosaxon masonry they are generally of a single stage only but sometimes of more and are not carried up higher than the cornice under which they often but not always finish with a slope they appear as if intended rather to relieve the plain external surface of the wall than to strengthen it norman portals not unfrequently occur formed in the thickness of a broad but shallow pilaster buttress as at iffley church oxfordshire and at stoneleigh and hamptoninarden churches warwickshire and elsewhere this kind of buttress was also used in the next or seminorman style q were there any towers a yes they were generally very low and massive and the exterior especially of the upper story was often decorated with arcades of blank semicircular and intersecting arches the parapet consisted of a plain projecting blockingcourse supported by the corbel table q do pinnacles appear to have been known to the normans a although some are of opinion that the pinnacle was not introduced till after the adoption of the pointed style many norman buildings have pinnacles of a conical shape which are apparently part of the original design q what distinction occurs in the construction of the small country churches of this style and the larger buildings of conventual foundation a small norman churches consisted of a single story only cathedral and conventual churches were carried up to a great height and were frequently divided into three tiers the lowest of which consisted of single arches separating the nave from the aisles above each of these arches in the second tier were two smaller arches constructed beneath a larger sometimes the same space was occupied by a single arch and in this tier was the triforium or gallery in the third tier or clerestory were frequently arcades of three arches connected together the middle one of which was higher and broader than the others and all these three occupied a space only equal to the span of the lowest arch blank arcades were also much used in the exterior walls as well as in the interior of rich norman buildings and some of the arches which composed them were often pierced for windows q what were the mouldings principally used in the decoration of norman churches a the chevron or zigzag which is not always single but often duplicated triplicated or quadrupled illustration illustration the reversed zigzag illustration the indented moulding illustration the embattled moulding illustration the dovetail moulding illustration the beak head illustration the nebule chiefly used for the fascia under a parapet illustration the billet illustration the square billet or corbel bole used for supporting a blocking course illustration the cable moulding illustration the double cone illustration the pellet or stud illustration the hatched or saw tooth illustration the nail head illustration the lozenge illustration the studded trellis illustration the diamond fret illustration the medallion illustration the star illustration the scalloped or invected moulding illustration a variety of other mouldings and ornamental accessories are also to be met with but those above described are the most common q what kind of stringcourse do we usually find carried along the walls of norman churches just below the windows a a stringcourse similar in form to the common norman abacus with a plain face and the under part bevelled is of most frequent occurrence a plain semihexagon stringcourse is also often to be met with sometimes the stringcourse is ornamented with the zigzag moulding illustration norman mouldings from binham church norfolk and peterborough q what difference is there as to their general character and appearance between the early and late examples of norman architecture a the details of those buildings early in the style are characterized by their massiveness simplicity and plain appearance the single or doublefaced semicircular arches both of doorways and windows as well as the arches supporting the clerestory walls are generally devoid of ornament and the edges of the jambs and arches are square the undercroft of canterbury cathedral the work of archbishop lanfranc between a d 1073 and a d 1080 the crypt and transepts of winchester cathedral built by bishop walkelyn between a d 1079 and a d 1093 the plain norman work of the abbey church at st albans built by abbot paul between 10771093 and the north and south aisles of the choir of norwich cathedral the work of bishop herbert between a d 1096 and a d 1101 not to multiply examples may be enumerated as instances of plain and early norman work in buildings late in the style we find a profusion of ornamental detail of a peculiar character and numerous semi and tripartite cylindrical mouldings on the faces and edges of arches and vaultingribs the transepts of peterborough cathedral built by abbot waterville between a d 1155 and a d 1175 exhibit vaultinggroins faced with roll mouldings and other details of an advanced stage whilst the galilee durham cathedral built by bishop pudsey a d 1180 is remarkable for the lightness and elongation of the piers which are formed of clustered columns and the semicircular arches which spring from these are enriched both on the face and soffits with the chevron or zigzag moulding there are many intermediate gradations between the extreme plain and massive work of early date and the enrichments mouldings and elongated proportions to be found late in the style and in detail we may perceive an almost imperceptible merging into that style which succeeded the norman illustration base crypt st peters oxford c 1100 footnotes 52 defunctus autem rex beatissimus in crastino sepultus est londini in ecclesia quam ipse novo compositionis genere construxerat a qua post multi ecclesias construentes exemplum adepti opus illud expensis oemulabantur sumptuosismatt paris illustration vesica piscis in the tympan of the south doorway ely cathedral chapter v of the seminorman style q what is the seminorman style a it is that style of transition which without superseding the norman style prevailed more or less in conjunction with it during the latter part of the twelfth century and probably even from an earlier period and gradually led to the complete adoption in the succeeding century of the early pointed style in a pure state and to the general disuse of the semicircular arch q by what is this style chiefly denoted a by the intersection of semicircular arches the frequent intermixture of the pointed arch in its incipient state with the semicircular arch and the pointed arch with its accompaniments of features mouldings and ornamental accessories exactly similar to those of the norman style both in its earlier and later gradations and from which it appears to have differed only in the contour or form of the arch illustration early specimen of intersecting arches st botolphs priory colchester 12th cent q whence are we to derive the origin of the pointed arch a many conjectural opinions on this muchcontested question have been entertained yet it still remains to be satisfactorily elucidated some would derive it from the east and ascribe its introduction to the crusaders some maintain that it was suggested by the intersection of semicircular arches which intersection we frequently find in ornamental arcades others contend that it originated from the mode of quadripartite vaulting adopted by the normans the segmental groins of which crossing diagonally produce to appearance the pointed arch whilst some imagine it may have been derived from that mystical figure of a pointed oval form the vesica piscis76 but whatever its origin it appears to have been imperceptibly brought into partial use towards the middle of the twelfth century illustration seminorman double piscina jesus college chapel cambridge q what are the characteristics of this style a in large buildings massive cylindrical piers support pointed arches above which we often find roundheaded clerestory windows as at buildwas abbey church salop or semicircular arches forming the triforium as at malmesbury abbey church wilts sometimes we meet with successive tiers of arcades in which the pointed arch is surmounted both by intersecting and semicircular arches as in a portion of the west front of croyland abbey church lincolnshire now in ruins the ornamental details and mouldings of this style generally partake of late norman character and the zigzag and semicylindrical mouldings on the faces of arches appear to predominate though other norman mouldings are common but we also frequently meet with specimens in the seminorman style in which extreme plainness prevails and the character is of that nature as to induce us to ascribe such buildings to rather an early period single and double and sometimes even triplefaced arches with the edges left square distinguish plain specimens of this style from the plainpointed doublefaced arches of the succeeding century the edges of which are splayed or chamfered in late instances of this as of the cotemporaneous norman style we observe in the details a gradual tendency to merge into those of the style of the thirteenth century when the pointed arch had attained maturity and the peculiar features and decorative mouldings and sculptures of norman character had fallen into isusetn2 q what specimen of this style is there of apparently early date illustration seminorman arch abbey church malmesbury a the church now in ruins of buildwas abbey salop founded a d 113579 is an early specimen of the seminorman style in which with the incipient pointed arch norman features and details are blended the nave is divided from the aisles by plain doublefaced pointed arches with square edges and hood mouldings over which spring from massive cylindrical piers with square bases and capitals whilst the clerestory windows above for there is no triforium are semicircularheaded the general features of early norman character the absence of decorative mouldings and the plain appearance this church exhibits throughout are such as perhaps to warrant the presumption that this church is the same structure mentioned in the charter of confirmation granted to this abbey by stephen a d 11389 q what other noted specimens are there of this style illustration intersecting window arches st cross church winchester a the church of the hospital of st cross near winchester presents an interesting combination of semicircular intersecting and pointed arches of cotemporaneous date enriched with the zigzag and other norman decorative mouldings and is a structure in appearance and detail of much later date than the church at buildwas abbey though the same early era has been assigned to each st josephs chapel glastonbury now in ruins supposed to have been erected in the reigns of henry the second and richard the first is perhaps the richest specimen now remaining of the seminorman or transition style and is remarkable for the profusion of sculptured detail and combination of round and intersecting arches in the remains of malmesbury abbey church a norman triforium with semicircular arches is supported on pointed arches which are enriched with norman mouldings and spring from massive cylindrical norman piers the interior of rothwell church northamptonshire has much of seminorman character the aisles are divided from the nave by four lofty plain and triplefaced pointed arches with square edges springing from square piers with attached semicylindrical shafts on each side and banded round midway between the bases and capitals and the latter which are enriched with sculptured foliage are surmounted by square abaci the west doorway is also of seminorman character and pointed and is set within a projecting mass of masonry resembling the shallow norman buttress the circular part of st sepulchres church northampton has early pointed arches plain in design springing from norman cylindrical piers in the circular part of the temple church london dedicated a d 1185 the piers consist of four clustered columns banded round midway between the bases and capitals and approximating the early english style of the thirteenth century and these support pointed arches over which and continued round the clerestory wall is an arcade of intersecting semicircular arches and above these are roundheaded windows illustration seminorman window oxford cathedral q what particular specimen of the seminorman style has been noticed by any cotemporaneous author and the date of it clearly defined a the eastern part of canterbury cathedral consisting of trinity chapel and the circular adjunct called beckets crown the building of these commenced the year following the fire which occurred a d 1174 and was carried on without intermission for several successive years gervase a monk of the cathedral and an eyewitness of this reedification wrote a long and detailed description of the work in progress and a comparison between that and the more ancient structure which was burnt he does not however notice in any clear and precise terms the general adoption of the pointed arch and partial disuse of the round arch in the new building from which we may perhaps infer they were at that period indifferently used or rather that the pointed arch was gradually gaining the ascendancy83 q how long does the semi or mixed norman style appear to have prevailed illustration seminorman arch st cross church winchester a though we can neither trace satisfactorily the exact period of its introduction or even that of its final extinction for it appears to have merged gradually into the pure and unmixed pointed style of the thirteenth century we have perhaps no remains of this kind to which we can attribute an earlier date than that included between the years 1130 and 1140 unless we except the intersecting arches at st botulphs priory church colchester which may be a few years earlier and it appears to have prevailed in conjunction or intermixed with the norman style from thence to the close of the twelfth century and probably to a somewhat later period illustration arcade christ church oxford footnotes 76 the figure of a fish whence the form vesica piscis originated was one of the most ancient of the christian symbols emblematically significant of the word ichthys which contained the initial letters of the name and titles of our saviour the symbolic representation of a fish we find sculptured on some of the sarcophagi of the early christians discovered in the catacombs at rome but the actual figure of a fish afterwards gave place to an ovalshaped compartment pointed at both extremities bearing the same mystical signification as the fish itself and formed by two circles intersecting each other in the centre this was the most common symbol used in the middle ages and thus delineated it abounds in anglosaxon illuminated manuscripts every where we meet with it during the middle ages in religious sculptures in painted glass on encaustic tiles and on seals and in the latter that is in those of many of the ecclesiastical courts the form is yet retained even with respect to the origin of the pointed arch that vexata qustio of antiquaries with what degree of probability may it not be attributed to this mystical form it is indeed in this symbolical figure that we see the outline of the pointed arch plainly developed at least a century and half before the appearance of it in architectonic form and in that age full of mystical significations the twelfth century when every part of a church was symbolized it appears nothing strange if this typical form should have had its weight towards originating and determining the adoption of the pointed archinternal decorations of english churches british critic april 1839 79 the date of the foundation of an abbey or church must not however be confounded with that of its actual erection which was often many years later and the only certain guide to which is the date of the consecration 83 in the minute and circumstantial account which gervase gives of the partial destruction of this cathedral by fire a d 1174 and its after restoration he seems to allude though in obscure language to the altered form of the vaulting in the aisles of the choir in circuitu extra chorum and his comparison with reference to this building between early and late norman architecture is altogether so curious and exact as to deserve being transcribed dictum est in superioribus quod post combustionem illam vetera fere omnia chori diruta sunt et in quandam augustioris form transierunt novitatem nunc autem qu sit operis

paulscray church kent chapter vi of the early english style q during what era did the early english style prevail a it may be said to have prevailed generally throughout the thirteenth century86 q how is it distinguished from the norman and seminorman styles a the semicircularheaded arch with its peculiar mouldings was almost entirely discarded and superseded by the pointed arch with plain chamfered edges or mouldings of a different character the segmental arch nearly flat was still however used in doorways and occasionally the semicircular also as in the arches of the retrochoir chichester cathedral q of what three kinds were the pointed arches of this era a the lancet the equilateral and the obtuseangled arch q which of these arches were most in use a in large buildings the lancet and the equilateralshaped arch were prevalent as appears in westminster abbey where the lancet arch predominates and salisbury cathedral where the equilateral arch is principally used but in small country churches the obtuseangled arch is most frequently found all these arches are struck from two centres and are formed from segments of a circle in large buildings the architrave is faced with a succession of roll mouldings and deep hollows in which the tooth ornament is sometimes inserted in small churches the arches which are doublefaced have merely plain chamfered edges q what was the difference of the piers between this and an earlier era a instead of the massive norman the early english piers were in large buildings composed of an insulated column surrounded by slender detached shafts all uniting together under one capital these shafts were divided into parts by horizontal bands or fillets but in small churches a plain octagonal pier which can however scarcely be distinguished from that of a later style predominated q how are the capitals distinguished a they are simple in comparison with those of a later style and are often bellshaped with a bead moulding round the neck and a capping with a series of mouldings above a very elegant and beautiful capital is frequently formed of stiffly sculptured foliage the capital surmounting the multangularshaped pier is also multangular in form but plain with a neck and cap mouldings and is difficult to be discerned from that of the succeeding style the cap mouldings are however in general not so numerous as those of a later period illustration capital chapter house southwell q how are the doorways of this style distinguished a the small doorways have generally a single detached shaft on each side with a plain moulded bellshaped capital which is sometimes covered with foliage and the architrave mouldings consist of a few simple members with a hood moulding or label over terminated by heads we also find richer doorways with two or more detached shafts at the sides and architrave mouldings composed of numerous members large doorways of the early english style were sometimes double being divided into two arched openings by a shaft either single or clustered and above this a quatrefoil was generally inserted but sometimes the head was filled with sculptured detail examples of the double doorway occur in the cathedrals of ely chichester wells salisbury lincoln and lichfield also at christchurch and st cross hants higham ferrers northamptonshire and in other large churches in this style illustration doorway baginton church warwickshire 13th cent q what kind of windows were prevalent illustration window beverley minster 13th cent illustration st giless oxford ely cathedral a in the early stages of this style the lancet archheaded window very long and narrow was prevalent frequently two three or more of these were connected together by hood mouldings the middle window rising higher than those at the sides sometimes they were unconnected and without hood mouldings in the east wall of early english chancels three lancet windows thus arranged are frequently displayed at a later period a broader window divided into two lights by a plain mullion finished at the top with a lozenge or circle was used and sometimes a window divided into three lights the middle one higher than the others and comprised under one hood moulding was in use windows of four and even five lancet lights thus disposed are to be met with but are not common the sides of the windows were in general simply splayed without mouldings and increased in width inwardly but slender shafts were sometimes annexed and we also find in the interior of rich buildings of this style detached shafts standing out in front of the stonework forming the window jambs and supporting the arch of the window towards the close of this style the windows assumed a more ornamental cast and became much larger being frequently divided into two or four principal lights with one or three circles in the heads both the lights and circles are foliated and these evince the transition in progress to the next or decorated style beneath the windows a stringcourse is generally carried horizontally along the wall and a roll moulding similar to the upper members of the stringcourse of merton college chapel oxford is most commonly met with as the stringcourse illustration interior of window st giless oxford q how is the buttress of this age distinguished a in general by its plain triangular or pedimental head its projecting more from the building than the norman buttress and from its being less in breadth it is also sometimes carried up above the parapet wall the edges of the buttresses are sometimes chamfered and plain buttresses in stages finished with simple slopes are not uncommon we very rarely find buttresses of this style disposed at the angles of buildings though such disposition was common in the succeeding style but two buttresses placed at right angles with each other and with the face of the wall generally occur at the angles of churches in this style flying buttresses were sometimes used to strengthen the clerestory walls of large buildings and have a light and elegant effect illustration stringcourse merton college chapel oxford q were the walls differently built a they were not so thick as those of an earlier period which occasioned the want of stronger buttresses to support them illustration pottern wilts illustration hartlepool durham q were the early english roofs of a different construction from those of a later style illustration groining rib salisbury cathedral a the norman and early english roofs were high and acutely pointed the original roofs of most of our old churches from their exposure to the weather have long since fallen to decay and been replaced by others of a more obtuse shape but in general the height and angular form of the original roof may be ascertained by the weather moulding still remaining on the side of the tower or steeple the interior vaulting of stone roofs was composed of fewer parts and ribs which were often not more numerous than those of norman vaulting and does not present that complexity of arrangement which occurs in the vaultingribs of subsequent styles in the cathedral of salisbury also in the nave of wells cathedral are simple and good examples of early english vaulting a curious groined roof in which the ribs are of woodplain cut with chamfered edgesand the cells of the vaulting are covered with boards is to be met with in the church of warmington northamptonshire a very rich perfect and interesting specimen of this style q was not the spire introduced at this period a yes many spires were then built among which was that of old st pauls cathedral more than five hundred feet high and which was destroyed by fire a d 1561 the spire of oxford cathedral is also of this style early english spires are generally what are called broach spires and spring at once from the external face of the walls of the tower without any intervening parapet q whence did the spire take its origin a it appears to have been suggested by the norman pinnacle which at first a conical capping afterwards became polygonal and ribbed at the angles thus presenting the prototype of the spire illustration q what ornament is peculiar or nearly so to this style a that called the tooth or dogtooth ornament a kind of pyramidalshaped flower of four leaves which is generally inserted in a hollow moulding and when seen in profile presents a zigzag or serrated appearance the tooth moulding appears to have been introduced towards the close of the twelfth century and an early instance where it occurs is on a late norman doorway at whitwell church rutlandshire we do not however meet with it in buildings of a later style than that of the thirteenth century it is sometimes found used in great profusion in doorways windows and other ornamental details but many churches of this style are entirely devoid of this ornament the ballflower though introduced in the thirteenth century is not a common ornament until the fourteenth to which era it may be said more particularly to belong we find it in cornice mouldings and sometimes on capitals q what may be observed of the sculptured foliage of this style a as applied to capitals bases crockets and other ornamental detail we find the general design and appearance of the sculptured foliage of this style to be stiff and formal compared with that of the succeeding style when the arrangement of the foliage more closely approximated nature and a greater freedom both in conception and execution was evinced illustration boss of sculptured foliage warmington church northamptonshire q how are the parapets distinguished a they are often plain and embattled but sometimes a simple horizontal parapet is used supported by a corbel table as in the tower of haddenham church buckinghamshire and on that of brize norton church oxfordshire at salisbury cathedral the parapet is relieved by a series of blank trefoil headed pannelstn3 sunk in the face q what may be said in general terms of the style of the thirteenth century in comparing it with the styles which immediately preceded and followed it illustration parapet salisbury cathedral a in comparison with the norman style with its heavy concomitants and enrichments the style of the thirteenth century is light and simple and the details possess much elegance of contour these in small buildings are generally plain but in large buildings they exhibit numerous mouldings combined with a certain degree of decorative embellishment this style is however far from presenting that extreme beauty of outline and tasteful conception combined with the pure and chaste ornamental accessories which prevail in the designs of the fourteenth century q what particular structures may be noticed as belonging to this style a salisbury cathedral built by bishop poore between a d 1220 and 1260 is perhaps the most perfect specimen on a large scale of this style in its early state with narrow lancet windows the nave and transepts of westminster abbey commenced in 1245 exhibit this style in a more advanced stage whilst lincoln cathedral is for the most part a rich specimen of this style in its late or transition state the west front of wells cathedral erected by the munificence of bishop joceline between a d 1213 and a d 1239 is covered with blank arcades and a number of trefoilheaded niches surmounted by plain pedimental canopies which contain specimens of statuary remarkable for their extreme beauty and freedom of design illustration corbel wells cathedral footnotes 86 from the economic principles on which our modern churches are with few exceptions planned they are mostly designed after and are intended to resemble in style those of the thirteenth century in which more detail can be dispensed with than in any other style hence it follows that the just proportions and adaptation of the different parts and the minutest details and mouldings in ancient churches of this style required to be carefully studied more so perhaps for practical purposes than in churches of any other style illustration dunchurch church warwickshire chapter vii of the decorated english style q when did the decorated english style commence and how long did it prevail a it may be said to have commenced in the latter part of the thirteenth century or reign of edward the first and to have prevailed about a century the transition from the early english style to this and again from this to the succeeding style was however so extremely gradual that it is difficult to affix any precise date for the termination of one style or the introduction of another illustration bracket york cathedral q whence does it derive its appellation a from there being a greater redundancy of chaste ornament in this than in the preceding style and though it does not exhibit that extreme multiplicity of decorative detail as the style of the fifteenth century the general contours and forms which this style presents and the principal lines of composition which verge pyramidically rather than vertically or horizontally are infinitely more pleasing and it is justly considered as the most beautiful style of english ecclesiastical architecture q what difference is there between the arches of this style which support the clerestory and those of an earlier period a the lancet arch is seldom seen the equilateral arch is generally though not always used both this and the obtuseangled arch are taken exclusively difficult to be distinguished from those of an earlier period in small buildings the edges of the pier arches are plain and chamfered in large churches a series of quarterround or rollmouldings which have often a squareedged fillet attached are applied to the subarch edges and facing illustration section of piers romtn4 grendon church warwickshire and austrey church warwickshire q what difference occurs in the piers from which these arches spring a in large buildings piers of this style were composed of a cluster of slender cylindrical shafts not standing detached from each other as in the early english style but closely united a common pier of this kind is formed of four shafts thus united without bands with a squareedged fillet running vertically up the face of each shaft sometimes a simple cylindrical pier is found the octagonal pier with plain sides is very prevalent in small churches and does not differ materially from the early english pier of the same kind the capitals are either bellshaped clustered or octagonal to correspond with the shape of the piers but the cap mouldings are more numerous than in the earlier style sometimes the capitals are sculptured in the churches of monkskirby warwickshire and of cropredy oxfordshire the arches which support the clerestory spring at once from the piers without any intervening capitals a practice not uncommon in the style of the fifteenth century but very rare in this q how are the vaulted roofs of this style distinguished a of the large stone vaulted roofs each bay is intersected by longitudinal transverse and diagonal ribs with shorter ribs springing from the bearing shafts intervening thus forming a series of vaulting cells more numerous than are to be met with in the early english style though not subdivided to the excess observable in the vaulted roofs of the fifteenth century sculptured bosses often occur at the intersections in the nave of york cathedral finished about a d 1330 the groining of the roof is less complicated than that of the choir of the same cathedral constructed between a d 1360 and a d 1370106 small structures are more simply vaulted in a chantry chapel adjoining the north side of the chancel of willingham church cambridgeshire is a very acutepointed angularshaped stone roof the plain surface of the vaulting of which is supported by two pointed arches springing from corbels projecting from the walls and these sustain straightsided stone vaulting ribs obliquely disposed to conform with the angle of the roof and which act as principals and above each arch and between that and the ridgeline of the oblique ribs or principals the space is filled with an open quatrefoil and other tracery the north transept of limington church somersetshire has a high pitched stone roof supported by groined ribs q are there many wooden roofs of this style remaining a we find comparatively few original wooden roofs in structures of the fourteenth century for such have generally been superseded by roofs of a later date and of a more obtuse form the high and acute pitch of the original roof is however still generally discernible by the weather moulding on the east wall of the tower in the nave of higham ferrars church northamptonshire is a wooden roof which apparently belongs to this style the roof is angularpointed and open to the ridgeline the walls are connected by tiebeams and under each of these is a wooden arch formed of two ribs or beams springing from stone corbels q in what respect do the doors of this style differ illustration window dunchurch church warwickshire a large doorways of this style have lateral shafts with capitals and between the shafts architrave mouldings intervene which run without stop into the base tablet of such the south doorway of st martins church leicester is an instance small doorways are generally without shafts but have a series of quarterround semicylindrical and tripartite roll mouldings at the sides which are continuous with the architrave mouldings and these have sometimes a squareedged fillet on the face the doorways of this style are frequently enriched with pedimental and ogeeshaped canopies ornamented with crockets and finials of which the north doorway of exeter cathedral and the south doorway of everdon church northamptonshire may be cited as examples large doorways have sometimes a double opening divided by a clustered shaft as in the entrance to the chapter house york cathedral in some instances the head of the doorway is foliated and we observe in detail an approximation to the succeeding style the west doorway of dunchurch church warwickshire is in this stage of transition q how are the windows of this style known illustration squareheaded decorated window ashby folville leicestershire a in the later stage of the early english style the windows became enlarged and the heads were filled with foliated circles to these succeeded in the fourteenth century windows ornamented with geometrical and flowing tracery peculiarities which exclusively pertain to this style and by which it is most easily known the windows are of good proportions and are divided into two or more principal lights by mullions which at the spring of the arch form designs of regular geometrical construction or branch out into flowing ramifications composing flamelike compartments which are foliated109 the variety of tracery in windows of this style is very great and they frequently have pedimental and ogee canopies over them ornamented in the same manner as those over doors examples of this kind may be found at york cathedral in the south transept of chichester and west front of exeter cathedrals are two exceeding large and beautiful windows of this style the first filled with geometrical the other with flowing tracery in some windows of this style the mullions simply cross in the head as in a later style but the lights are commonly foliated and the difference may in general be discerned by the mouldings such windows occur in stoneleigh church warwickshire there are also many squareheaded windows in this style distinguished by the flowing tracery in the heads and by other characteristic marks of such a window in ashby folville church leicestershire is a rich and good example circular windows filled with tracery are not uncommon in large buildings and we also meet with triangular sphericalshaped windows as in the clerestory of barton segrave church northamptonshire111 illustration window barton segrave church q of what description are the mouldings which pertain to this style illustration moulding dunchurch church warwickshire illustration roll moulding chacombe church northamptonshire illustration stringcourse sedgeberrow church gloucestershire illustration ballflower ornament bloxham church oxfordshire and york cathedral a they approximate more nearly in section and appearance those of the thirteenth than those of the fifteenth century but the members are generally more numerous than in those of the former style quarterround half and tripartite cylinder mouldings often filleted along the face and divided by small cavetto mouldings sometimes deeply cut are common the stringcourse under the windows frequently consists as in the preceding style of a simple roll moulding the upper member of which overlaps the lower a plain semicylindrical moulding with a squareedged fillet on the face is also common and occurs at the church of ortononthehill leicestershire the hood moulding over the windows often consists of a quarterround or ogee with a cavetto beneath and sometimes returns horizontally along the walls as a stringcourse a disposition however more frequently observable in the early english style than in this of such disposition the churches of harvington worcestershire and of sedgeberrow gloucestershire may be cited as affording examples in decorative work we often meet with the ballflower one of the most characteristic ornaments of the style consisting of a ball inclosed within three or four leaves and sometimes bearing a resemblance to the rosebud inserted at intervals in a cavetto or hollow moulding with the accompaniment in some instances of foliage a fourleaved flower inserted in the same manner is also not uncommon illustration illustration decorated buttress st mary magdalen oxford q how may the buttresses of this style be distinguished illustration flying buttress salisbury cathedral a they were worked in stages and their setoffs have frequently triangular heads sometimes plain but often ornamented with crockets and finials of a more decorative character than those of the early english style many buttresses have however plain slopes as setoffs and they are frequently placed diagonally at the corners of buildings as at dunchurch church warwickshire the flying buttresses at salisbury cathedral in which the thrust is partly counterpoised by pyramidalheaded pinnacles decorated with crockets and finials are of this age q what parapet is peculiar to this style a besides the plain embattled parapet which is not always easy to be distinguished from other styles a horizontal blocking course pierced with foliated or wavy flowing tracery which has a rich effect is common of this description specimens occur at st mary magdalen church oxford and brailes church warwickshire q what is observable in the niches of this style a they are very beautiful and are generally surmounted by triangular or ogeeshaped canopies enriched with crockets and finials while the interior of the canopies are groined with numerous small rib mouldings the crockets and finials of this style as decorative embellishments are peculiarly graceful chaste and pleasing in contour q was the transition from this style to the next gradual a both the transition from the early english to the decorated style and from the decorated to the florid or perpendicular was so gradual that though many individual details and ornaments were extremely dissimilar and peculiar to each particular style we are only able to judge from examples when a change was generally established q from what cotemporary writers of the fourteenth century can we collect any architectural notices either general or of detail illustration part of the altar screen winchester cathedral a in chaucer we find allusions made to imageries pinnacles tabernacles canopied niches for statuary and corbelles lydgate in the siege of troy in his description of the buildings adverts to those of his own age and uses several architectural terms now obsolete or little understood and some which are not so as gargoiles in pierce ploughmans creed we have a concise but faithful description of a large monastic edifice of the fourteenth century comprising the church or minster cloister chapter house and other offices q what edifices maybe noticed as constructed in this style a in exeter cathedral this style may be said generally to prevail although some portions are of earlier and some of later date great part of lichfield cathedral was also built during the fourteenth century the beautiful cloisters adjoining norwich cathedral commenced a d 1297 but not finished for upwards of a century although proceeded with by different prelates from time to time rank as the most beautiful of the kind we have remaining several country churches are wholly or principally erected in this style broughton church oxfordshire may be instanced as an elegant pleasing and complete example of plain decorated work trumpington church cambridgeshire is also deserving of notice and wimington church bedfordshire built by john curteys lord of the manor who died a d 1391 is a small but late edifice in the decorated style annexations were also made during this century to numerous churches of earlier construction by the erection of additional aisles or chapels as chantries in all these structures we find more or less in general appearance form and detail of that extreme beauty and elegance of design which prevailed as it were for about a century and then imperceptibly glided away illustration parapet magdalen church oxford footnotes 106 the allusion is made to the vaulted roofs of the nave and choir of this cathedral as they existed previous to the late unfortunate and destructive fires 109 the flamboyant window common in france is not often met with in this country on the north side of salford church warwickshire is however a window of this description filled with flamboyant tracery 111 for specimens of decorated windows with flowing tracery in the heads vide cuts pp 12 and 13 illustration south porch of newbolduponavon church warwickshire chapter viii of the florid or perpendicular english style q when may this style be said to have commenced and how long did it prevail a we find traces of it in buildings erected at the close of the reign of edward the third circa a d 1375 and it prevailed for about a century and half or rather more till late in the reign of henry the eighth circa a d 1539 q whence does it derive its appellation a from the multiplicity profusion and minuteness of its ornamental detail it has by some received the designation of florid by others from the mullions of the windows and the divisions of ornamental panelwork running in straight or perpendicular lines up to the head which is not the case in any earlier style it has been called and is now better known by the designation of the perpendicular121 q in what respects did it differ from the style which immediately preceded it a the beautiful flowing contour of the lines of tracery characteristic of the decorated style was superseded by mullions and transoms and in panelwork lines of division disposed vertically and horizontally and in lieu of the quarterround semi and tripartite roll and small hollow mouldings of the fourteenth century angularedged mouldings with bold cavettos became predominant q of what kind are the arches of this style a although in this style pointed arches constructed from almost every radius are to be found the complex fourcentred arch commonly called the tudor arch was almost peculiar to it and the cavetto or wide and rather shallow hollow moulding a characteristic feature of this style often appears in the architrave mouldings of pier arches doorways and windows and as a cornice moulding under parapets illustration window st marys church oxford illustration mullion burford church oxfordshire q how are the piers of this style which support the clerestory arches distinguished from those of an earlier period illustration capital piddleton church dorsetshire a the section of a pier which is common in this style may be described as formed from a square or parallelogram with the angles fluted or cut in a bold hollow and on the flat face of each side of the pier a semicylindrical shaft is attached the flat faces or sides of the pier and the hollow mouldings at the angles are carried up vertically from the base moulding to the spring of the arch and thence without the interposition of any capital in a continuous sweep to the apex of the arch but the slender shafts attached to the piers have capitals the upper members of which are angularshaped the base mouldings are also polygonal piers and arches of this description are numerous and occur amongst other churches in st thomas church salisbury cerne abbas church bradford abbas church and piddleton church dorsetshire yeovil church somersetshire and burford church oxfordshire in some churches a very slender shaft with a capital is attached to each angle of the pier which is disposed lozengewise the main body of the pier presenting continuous lines of moulding with those of the arch unbroken by any capital as in the piers of bath abbey church rebuilt early in the sixteenth century in small country churches we frequently find the architrave mouldings of the arch continued down the piers which are altogether devoid of any horizontal stop by way of capital the churches of brinklow and willoughby in warwickshire afford instances of this kind piers somewhat different to those above described are also to be met with but are not so common q what else may be noted respecting some of the piers and arches in this style a the face of the subarch or soffit is sometimes enriched with oblong panelled compartments archedheaded and foliated and these are continued down the inner sides of the piers the arches of the tower of cerne abbas church dorsetshire and some of the arches in sherborne church in the same county may be instanced as examples illustration panelled arch sherborne church dorsetshire q how may we distinguish the doorways and doors of this style a many doorways of this style especially during its early progress were surmounted by crocketted ogeeshaped hood mouldings terminating with finials in the most common doorway of this style however the depressed fourcentred arch appears within a square head and in general a rectangular hood moulding over and the spandrels or spaces between the spring and apex of the arch and angles of the square head over it are filled with quatrefoils panelling foliage small shields or other sculptured ornaments sometimes the depressed fourcentred arch appears without any hood moulding and we occasionally meet with a simple pointed arch described from two centres placed within a rectangular compartment doorways in this style are often profusely ornamented and it is common to see doors covered with panelwork boldly recessed the compartments of which are sometimes filled in the heads with crocketed ogee arches which produce a rich effect illustration doorway all souls college oxford q are there many fine porches of this style a more than in any other style and they are often profusely enriched the front and sides being covered with panelwork tracery and niches for statuary the interior of the roof is frequently groined sometimes with fan tracery but generally with simple though numerous ribs and in many instances a room is constructed over the groined entrance or lower story of the porch but so as to be in keeping with and form part of the general design the south porch of gloucester cathedral the southwest porch of canterbury cathedral the south porch of st johns church cirencester and the south porch of burford church oxfordshire may be noticed as examples of rich porches of this style many others might also be enumerated as they are very numerous and various in detail some porches are comparatively plain as the south porch of the church of newbolduponavon warwickshire q how are the windows distinguished illustration window new college chapel oxford a the chief characteristic in the windows of this style and which renders them easily distinguished from those of an earlier era consists in the vertical bearing of the mullions which instead of diverging off in flowing lines are carried straight up into the head of the window smaller mullions spring from the heads of the principal lights and thus the upper portion of the window is filled with panellike compartments the principal as well as the subordinate lights are foliated in the heads and in large windows the lights are often divided horizontally by transoms which are sometimes embattled from the continued upright position of the mullions and tracerybars is derived the term perpendicular as applied to this style the forms of the windowarches vary from the simple pointed to the complex fourcentred arch more or less depressed the windows of the clerestory are sometimes arched but oftener squareheaded and some large windows of the latter description nearly cover the sides of the clerestory walls of chipping norton church oxfordshire q what do we frequently observe in buildings of this style a the interior walls of churches are often completely covered with panelwork tracery arched headed and foliated from the clerestory windows down to the mouldings of the arches below the walls of sherborne church dorsetshire present in the interior a surface almost entirely covered with panelwork several large churches in this style have also long ranges of clerestory windows set so close to each other that the whole length of the clerestory wall seems perforated we may enumerate as examples the churches of st michael coventry stratforduponavon warwickshire and lavenham and melford suffolk walls covered on the exterior with panelwork are also far from uncommon the abbots tower evesham the tower of the church of st neots huntingdonshire and of wrexham denbighshire and many other rich towers especially those of the churches in somersetshire where rich specimens in this style abound more so perhaps than in any other county are thus decorated the exterior of many rich structures in this style are also covered with panelwork as the beauchamp chapel warwick the west front of winchester cathedral and henry the sevenths chapel westminster abbey illustration parapet st peters church oxford q how are the vaulted roofs of this style distinguished a they are in detail more complicated than those of earlier styles and in plain as distinguished from fantracery vaulting the groining ribs are more numerous the ribs often diverge at different angles and form geometricalshaped panels or compartments and the design has in some instances been assimilated to network plain vaulting of this style occurs in the nave and choir norwich cathedral the lady chapel and choir gloucester cathedral the nave winchester cathedral the beauchamp chapel warwick and a very late specimen in the choir oxford cathedral a very rich and peculiar description of vaulting is one composed of pendant semicones covered with foliated panelwork and from the design resembling a fan spread open called fantracery of this description of vaulting an early instance appears in the cloisters gloucester cathedral the roofs of kings college chapel cambridge and henry the sevenths chapel westminster abbey are wellknown examples and portions of several of our cathedrals and many small chantry and sepulchral chapels are thus vaulted q what may be observed of the wooden roofs of this style illustration wooden roof south aisle st marys church leicester a they are far more numerous than those we meet with in all the previous styles and we frequently find churches of early date in which the original roofs having perhaps become decayed have been removed and replaced by roofs designed in that style prevalent during the fifteenth century the slope or pitch of the roof is much lower than before and the form altogether more obtuse and sometimes approaching nearly to flatness the exterior is on this account often entirely concealed from view by the parapet many roofs of this style are divided into bays or compartments by horizontal tiebeams faced with mouldings and apparently supported by curved ribs springing from corbels and forming spandrels filled with open worked tracery and the spaces between the tiebeam the kingpost and the sloping rafters of the roof are filled with pierced or openwork tracery the sloping bays or compartments of the roof are divided by rib mouldings into squares or parallelograms of panelwork which are again often subdivided into similarshaped panels by smaller ribs with carved bosses at the intersections some roofs are nearly flat and simply panelled on many roofs traces of painting and gilding may still be discerned more especially in that part which was over an altar and where the roof often bears indications of having been more ornamented than other parts roofs painted of an azure colour and studded with gilt stars are not uncommon sometimes the roof is coved and the boards are painted in imitation of clouds a great variety of wooden roofs is to be met with in this style many of them exceeding rich whilst the cornice under the roof is sometimes elaborately carved and enriched some roofs are much plainer in construction than others and it was during this era a part of the church on the enrichment of which no small expense and attention were bestowed q what may be noted respecting the parapets of this era illustration parapet st peters church dorchester a many embattled parapets are covered with sunk or pierced panelling and ornamented with quatrefoils or small trefoilheaded arches and they have sometimes triangularshaped heads as at kings college chapel cambridge and at the east end of peterborough cathedral we also find horizontal or straightsided parapets covered with sunk or pierced quatrefoils in circles a plain embattled parapet with the horizontal coping moulding continued or carried down the sides of the embrasures and then again returning horizontally as at st peters church dorchester dorsetshire is also common a bold but shallow cavetto or hollow cornice moulding is frequently carried along the wall just under the parapet q was the panelled or sunk quatrefoil much used in decorative detail a in rich buildings of this style the base the parapet and other intermediate portions were decorated with rows or bands of sunk quatrefoils sometimes inclosed in circles sometimes in squares and sometimes in lozengeshaped compartments illustration rose and foliage henry viis chapel westminster abbey q what other ornamental detail is peculiar to this style a the rose which differing only in colour was the badge both of the houses of york and lancaster and as such is often to be met with rows of a trefoil or lozengeshaped leaf somewhat like an oak or strawberry leaf with a smaller trefoil more simple in design intervening between two larger was frequently used as a finish to the cornice of rich screenwork and is known under the designation of the tudor flower it is also common to find the tendrils leaves and fruit of the vine carved or sculptured in great profusion in the hollow of rich cornice mouldings especially on screenwork in the interior of a church illustration vine leaves and fruit whitchurch church somersetshire q in what respect do the mouldings of this style differ from those of earlier styles a in a greater prevalence of angular forms which may be observed in noticing the section of a series of mouldings and in the bases and capitals of cylindrical shafts a large and bold but shallow hollow moulding or cavetto in which when forming part of a horizontal fascia or cornice flowers leaves and other sculptured details are often inserted at intervals is a common feature and such moulding without any insertion is frequent in doorway and window jambs a kind of double ogee moulding with little projection is in conjunction with other mouldings also of common occurrence illustration window st peters church oxford q of what particular description of work do we find the existing remains to be almost entirely designed and executed in this style of ecclesiastical art a of the numerous specimens of rich wooden screens composed as to the lower part of sunk panelling with open work above which we often find separating the chancel from the body of the church supporting the roodloft and inclosing chantry chapels in side aisles comparatively few now remaining are of an earlier date than the fifteenth century137 q what do we find in large buildings erected late in this style a octagonal turrets plain or covered with sunk panelling and surmounted with ogeeheaded cupolas which are adorned with crockets and finials in henry the sevenths chapel westminster they are used as buttresses we also find them at kings college chapel cambridge at st georges chapel windsor and at winchester cathedral q have we any coeval documents which contain particulars relating to the erection of churches a the contract entered into a d 1412 for the building of catterick church yorkshire and the contract entered into a d 1435 for rebuilding as it now stands the collegiate church of fotheringhay in northamptonshire or copies of such have been preserved as have particulars also from the contracts entered into a d 1450 for the fitting up of the beauchamp chapel st marys church warwick in the will of king henry the sixth dated a d 1447 we find specific directions given for the size and arrangement of kings college chapel cambridge and no less than five different indentures are preserved the earliest dated a d 1513 the latest a d 1527 containing contracts for the execution of different parts of that celebrated structure the will of king henry the seventh dated a d 1509 contains several orders and directions relating to the completion of the splendid chapel adjoining the abbey church westminster q mention some of the earliest buildings of this style the dates of the erection of which have been clearly ascertained a the tower of st michaels church coventry the building of which commenced a d 1373 and was finished a d 1395140 is an early and fine specimen the beautiful and lofty spire was however an after addition like that at salisbury cathedral and was not commenced till a d 1432 westminster hall140 the reparation or reconstruction of the greater part of which by king richard the second was commenced a d 1397 and finished a d 1399 has a fine groined porch the front of which exhibits the square head over the arch of entrance and the spandrels are filled with quatrefoils inclosing shields and sunk panelwork the large window above the porch and that at the west end are divided into panellike compartments by vertical mullions and a transom divides the principal lights horizontally the wooden roof is of a more acute pitch than we usually find in buildings of this style and is remarkable as a specimen of constructive art and display the spaces between the arches and rafters are filled up to the ridgepiece with open panelwork ornamentally designed and this is perhaps the earliest specimen we possess of the perpendicular wooden roof q what complete structures are there in this style of a late date the periods of the erection of which are ascertained a the design for the rebuilding of the abbey church bath was planned and the reconstruction thereof commenced by bishop king a d 1500 and after his death the works were carried on by priors bird and hollowaye but the church was not completed when the surrender of the monastery took place a d 1539 the foundation of henry the sevenths chapel westminster abbey was laid a d 1502 but the chapel was not completed till the reign of henry the eighth it is the richest specimen on a large scale of this style of architecture and is completely covered both internally and externally with panelwork niches statuary heraldic devices cognizances and other decorative embellishment the church at st neots huntingdonshire is a fine large parochial edifice all built apparently after one regular design and consists of a tower covered with panelwork and ornament with crocketed pinnacles at the angles and in front of each side a nave north and south aisles and chancel and two chantry chapels forming a continuation eastward of each aisle it has a fine wooden roof the cornice under which is in different parts curiously carved in relief this church is said to have been erected a d 1507 but one of the most perfect specimens of a late date on a smaller scale is the church of whiston northamptonshire built a d 1534 by anthony catesby esquire lord of the manor isabel his wife and john their son it consists of a tower encircled with rows of quatrefoils and other decorative embellishment and finished with crocketed pinnacles at the angles a nave divided from the north and south aisles by arches within rectangular compartments the spandrels of which are filled with sunk quatrefoils and foliated panels these arches spring from piers disposed lozengewise with semicylindrical shafts at the angles there are no clerestory windows and the windows of the aisles and chancel have obtuselypointed fourcentred arches the wooden roof is a good example of the kind q what district is noted for the number of rich churches in this style illustration st stephens church bristol a somersetshire contains a number of fine churches erected apparently towards the close of the fifteenth or very early in the sixteenth century and many of these churches have much of carved woodwork in screens roodlofts pulpits and in pewing the towers are in particular remarkable for their general style of design and are often divided into stages by bands of quatrefoils the sides are more or less ornamented with projecting canopied niches for statuary and in many of these niches the statues have been preserved from the iconoclastic zeal which has elsewhere prevailed the belfry windows are partly pierced sometimes in quatrefoils and partly filled with sunk panelwork the parapets whether embattled or straightsided are pierced with open work and at each angle of the tower at which buttresses are disposed rectangularwise is finished with a crocketed pinnacle which is also often to be met with rising from the middle of the parapet towers similar in general design to those which may be said to prevail in somersetshire are not unfrequently met with in other counties but do not exhibit that provincialism which is the case in that particular county illustration king henry viis

remains of a wooden screen of late norman character between the chancel and nave of stanton harcourt church oxfordshire is an early wooden screen in the style of the thirteenth century the lower division is of plain panelwork whilst the upper division consists of a series of openpointed arches trefoiled in the heads and supported by slender cylindrical shafts with moulded bases and capitals and an annulated moulding encircles each shaft midway up in northfleet church kent is a wooden screen which approximates in general design that at stanton harcourt but is in a more advanced stage of art being of the early decorated style the lower portion of this is of plain panelling while the open work forming the upper division above consists of a series of pointed arches with tracery and foliations in and between the heads supported by slender cylindrical shafts banded round midway with moulded bases and capitals and these arches support a horizontal cornice specimens of decorated screenwork some much mutilated others in a more perfect state are existing in the churches of kings sutton northamptonshire croperdy oxfordshire beaudesert warwickshire and in st johns church winchester a characteristic distinction between screenwork of an earlier date than the fifteenth century and screenwork of that period will be found to consist in the slender cylindrical shafts often annulated sometimes not with moulded bases and capitals which pertain to early work of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and the mullionlike and angularedged bars often faced with small buttresses which form the principal vertical divisions in screenwork of the fifteenth century 140 this stately monument of private munificence was erected at the sole charges of two brothers adam and william botnor it was twentyone years in building and cost each year 100l 140 though not an ecclesiastical structure it is here noticed as an example of the style in an early stage illustration window duffield church derbyshire chapter ix of the debased english style q when did this style commence and how long did it prevail or continue a it may be said to have commenced about the year 1540 and to have continued to about the middle of the seventeenth century but it is difficult to assign a precise date either for its introduction or discontinuance q why is this style called the debased a from the general inferiority of design compared with the style it succeeded from the meagre and clumsy execution of sculptured and other ornamental work from the intermixture of detail founded on an entirely different school of art and the consequent subversion of the purity of style q what may be considered as one great cause of this falling off a the devastation of the monasteries religious houses and chantries which followed their suppression discouraged the study of ecclesiastical architecture which had been much followed by the members of the conventual foundations who were now dispersed in their seclusion and gave a fatal blow to that spirit of erecting and enriching churches which this country had for many ages possessed q how could this be the cause a the expenses of erecting many of our ecclesiastical structures or different portions of them from time to time in the most costly and beautiful manner according to the style of the age in which such were built were defrayed some out of the immense revenues of the monasteries which at their suppression were granted away by the crown and others by the private munificence of individuals who frequently built an aisle with a chantry chapel at the east end partly inclosed by screenwork or annexed to a church a transept or an additional chapel endowed as a chantry in order that remembrance might be specially and continually made of them in the offices of the church according to the then prevailing usage which chantries having been abolished one motive for churchbuilding was gone q what concurrent causes may also be assigned for this change a the almost imperceptible introduction and advance about this period of a fantastic mode of architectural design and decoration which is very apparent in the costly though in many respects inelegant monuments of this age and in which details of ancient classic architecture were incorporated with others of fanciful design peculiar to the latter part of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth centuries q what are the characteristics of this style a a general heaviness and inelegance of detail doorways with pointedarched heads exceedingly depressed in form and also plain roundheaded doorways with key stones after the roman or italian semiclassic style now beginning to prevail squareheaded windows with plain vertical mullions and the heads of the lights either round or obtusely arched and generally without foliations pointed windows clumsily formed with plain mullion bars simply intersecting each other in the head or filled with tracery miserably designed and an almost total absence of ornamental mouldings indications of this style may be found in many country churches which have been repaired or partly rebuilt since the reformation in the interior of churches specimens of the woodwork of this style are very common and may be perceived by the shallow and flat carved panelling with round arches arabesques scrollwork and other nondescript ornament peculiar to the age with which the pews readingdesks and pulpits are often adorned the screens of this period are constructed in a semiclassic style of design with features and details of english growth and are often surmounted with scrollwork shields and other accessories of this description of work the screen in the south aisle of yarnton church oxfordshire constructed a d 1611 may be instanced as a curious specimen illustration arabesque q what peculiarity may be noted in the alterations and additions of this era a a very common practice prevailed from about the middle of the sixteenth century when any alteration or addition was made in or to a church of affixing a stone in the masonry with the date of such in figures thus over the east window of hillmorton church warwickshire which is a pointed window of four lights formed by three plain mullions curving and intersecting each other in the head which is filled with nearly lozengeshaped lights but all without foliations is a stone bearing the date of 1640 in the south wall of the tower of the same church which is low heavy and clumsily built without any pretension to architectural design is a stone to denote the period of its erection which bears the date of 1655 pulpits communiontables church chests poorboxes and pewing of the latter part of the sixteenth and of the seventeenth century also very frequently exhibit in figures carved on them the precise periods of their construction q what specimens are there of this style of late or debased and mixed gothic a annexed to sunningwell church berkshire is a singular porch or building sexagonal in form at the angles of which are projecting columns of the ionic order supporting an entablature on each side of this building except that by which it communicates with the church and that in which the doorway is contained is a plain window of the debased gothic style of one light with a square head and hood moulding over the doorway is nondescript neither roman or gothic this building is supposed to have been erected by bishop jewell the chapel of st peters college cambridge finished in 1632 exhibits in the east wall a large pointed window clumsily designed in the debased style and divided by mullions into five principal lights roundheaded but trefoiled within three series of smaller lights rising one above the other all of which are roundheaded and trefoiled fill the head of the window the composition of which though comparatively rude is illustrative of the taste of the age on each side of the window on the exterior is a kind of semiclassic niche in stowe church northamptonshire are a number of windows inserted at a general reparation of the church in 1639 these are squareheaded and have a label or hood moulding over and are mostly divided into three obtusely pointedarched lights without foliations under the windows of the south aisle is a stringcourse more of a semiclassic contour than gothic on the south side is a plain roundheaded doorway inserted at the same period the tower and south aisle of yarnton church oxfordshire erected by sir thomas spencer a d 1611 have the same kind of squareheaded window with arched lights without foliations as those of stow stantonharold church leicestershire erected a d 1653 is perhaps the latest complete specimen of the debased gothic style towards the end of this century gothic mouldings appear not to have been understood as in the attempt to reconstruct portions of churches in that style we find mouldings of classic art to prevail such is the case with respect to the tower of eynesbury church st neots huntingdonshire rebuilt in a kind of debased gothic and mixed roman style in 1687 other instances of the kind might also be enumerated at the commencement of the eighteenth century the roman or italian mode appears to have prevailed generally in the churches then erected without any admixture even of the debased gothic style illustration window ladbrook church warwickshire illustration stoup south door oakham church rutlandshire concluding chapter on the internal arrangement and decorations of a church the churches of this country were anciently so constructed as to display in their internal arrangement certain appendages designed with architectonic skill and adapted purposely for the celebration of mass and other religious offices at the reformation when the ritual was changed and many of the formularies of the church of rome were discarded some of such appendages were destroyed whilst others though suffered to exist more or less in a mutilated condition were no longer appropriated to the particular uses for which they had been originally designed on entering a church through the porch on the north or south side or at the west end we sometimes perceive on the right hand side of the door at a convenient height from the ground often beneath a niche and partly projecting from the wall a stone basin this was the stoup or receptacle for holy water called also the aspersorium into which each individual dipped his finger and crossed himself when passing the threshold of the sacred edifice the custom of aspersion at the church door appears to have been derived from an ancient usage of the heathens amongst whom according to sozomen154 the priest was accustomed to sprinkle such as entered into a temple with moist branches of olive the stoup is sometimes found inside the church close by the door but the stone appendage appears to have been by no means general and probably in most cases a movable vessel of metal was provided for the purpose and in an inventory of ancient church goods at st dunstans canterbury taken a d 1500 we find mentioned a stope off lede for the holy watr atte the church dore we do not often find the stoup of so ancient a date as the twelfth century one much mutilated but apparently of that era may however be met with inside the little norman church of beaudesert warwickshire near to the south door the porch was often of a considerable size and had frequently a groined ceiling with an apartment above it was anciently used for a variety of religious rites for before the reformation considerable portions of the marriage and baptismal services and also much of that relating to the churching of women were here performed being commenced ante ostium ecclesi and concluded in the church and these are set forth in the rubric of the manual or servicebook according to the use of sarum containing those and other occasional offices having entered the church the font is generally discovered towards the west end of the nave or north or south aisle and near the principal door such at least was in most cases its original and appropriate position this was for the convenience of the sacramental rite there administered part of the baptismal service that of making the infant a catechumen having been performed in the porch or outside the door156 he was introduced by the priest into the church with the invitation ingredere in templum dei ut habeas vitam ternam et vivas in scula sculorum and after certain other rites and prayers the infant was carried to the font and immersed therein thrice by the priest in the names of the three persons of the holy trinity by an ancient ecclesiastical constitution a font of stone or other durable material with a fitting cover was required to be placed in every church in which baptism could be administered156 and it was as lyndwood informs us to be capacious enough for total immersion some ancient fonts are of lead as that in dorchester church oxfordshire and that in childrey church berkshire both of these are cylindrical in shape and of the norman era encircled with figures in relief those on the font at dorchester representing the twelve apostles whilst those on that of childrey are of bishops leaden fonts are also to be met with in the churches of brookland kent wareham dorsetshire and walmsford northamptonshire square and cylindrical or truncated conelike shaped fonts of norman design supported on a basement by one or more shafts and either plain or sculptured are numerous we sometimes find on them figures of the twelve apostles sculptured in low relief the baptism of our saviour also was no uncommon representation fonts subsequent to the norman era are not so frequently covered with sculptured figures though such sometimes occur they are sexagonal septagonal or octagonal in shape and the different styles are easily ascertained by the architectural decorations mouldings tracery and panelwork with which they are more or less covered on the sides of rich fonts of the fifteenth century representations of the seven sacraments were not unfrequently sculptured as on that in farningham church kent the covers to some rich fonts especially to some of those of the fifteenth century were very splendid in shape somewhat resembling that of a spire but the sides were covered with tabernaclework and decorated at the angles with small buttresses and crockets fonts with rich covers of this description are to be found in the churches of ewelme oxfordshire of north walsham and of worstead norfolk and of sudbury and of ufford suffolk158 the general situation of the tower or campanile is at the west end of the nave it is sometimes however found in a different position as at the west end of a side aisle which is the case with respect to the churches of monkskirby and withybrooke warwickshire or on one side of the church as at eynesbury church huntingdonshire and alderbury church salop and the tower of the latter church is covered with what is called the saddleback roof having two gablesa peculiarity to be found in some few other churches in cross churches the tower was generally though not always erected at the intersection of the transept and between the nave and chancel in the towers the church bells were hung with the exception of one without these no church was accounted complete they were anciently consecrated with great ceremony named and inscribed in honour of some saint and the sound issuing from them was supposed to be of efficacy in averting the influence of evil spirits bells appear to have been introduced into this country in the latter part of the seventh century but comparatively few bells are now remaining in our churches of an earlier date than the seventeenth century since the commencement of which century most of our present church bells have been cast towers were also occasionally used up to the fourteenth century as parochial fortresses to which in time of sudden and unforeseen danger the inhabitants of the parish resorted for awhile the tower of rugby church warwickshire a very singular structure built in the reign of henry the third appears to have been erected for this purpose it is of a square form very lofty and plain in construction and is without a single buttress to support it the lower windows are very narrow and at a considerable distance from the ground some of them are in fact mere loopholes the belfry windows are squareheaded of two lights simply trefoiled in the head and divided by a plain mullion the only entrance was through the church it has also a fireplace the funnel for the conveyance of smoke being carried up through the thickness of the wall to a perforated battlement and it altogether seems well calculated to resist a sudden attack other church towers of early date appear to have been erected for a double purpose that of a campanile as well as to afford temporary security the towers of newton arlosh church of the church of burgh on the sands and of great salkeld church cumberland appear to have been constructed with a view to afford protection to the inhabitants of those villages upon any sudden invasion from the borders of scotland and for that purpose were strongly fortified160 some church towers especially in the counties of norfolk and suffolk are round and batter or gradually decrease in diameter as they rise upwards most of these are of the norman though some are in the early english style that at little saxham church suffolk may be adduced as a specimen spires in some instances appear to have served as landmarks to guide travellers through woody districts and over barren downs the spire of astley church warwickshire now destroyed was so conspicuous an object at a distance that it was denominated the lantern of arden the spires of the churches of monkskirby and clifton in the same county now also destroyed were formerly noticed as eminent landmarks illustration little saxham church tower suffolk illustration open seat culworth church northamptonshire anciently the body of the church appears to have contained no other fixed seats for the congregation than a solid mass of masonry raised against the wall and forming a long stone bench or seat a bench of this description runs along great part of the north west and south sides of the norman church of parranforth cornwall in the norman conventual church of romsey plain stone benches of this description occur they are likewise to be met with in salisbury and other cathedrals also in some of our ancient parish churches as in the south aisle of kidlington church oxfordshire seats for the use of the congregation are noticed in the synod of exeter held a d 1287 open wooden benches or pewwork are rarely if at all met with of an earlier era than the fifteenth century when the practice of pewing the body of the church with open wooden seats if not then introduced began to prevail in 1458 we meet with a testamentary bequest of money to make seats called puying and several of our churches still retain considerable remains of the ancient open seats of the fifteenth century at finedon in northamptonshire the body of the church and aisles are almost entirely filled with low open seats with carved tracery at the ends disposed in four distinct rows so that the whole of the congregation might sit facing the east similar seats occur in culworth church in the same county and these are likewise of the fifteenth century the pulpit was anciently disposed towards the eastern part of the body of the church but not in the centre of the aisle pulpits are now rarely to be found of an earlier date than the fifteenth century when they appear to have been introduced into many churches though not to have become a general appendage ancient pulpits of that era whether of wood or stone are covered with panelwork tracery and mouldings and some exhibit signs of having been once elaborately painted and gilt mention however is made of pulpits at a much earlier period for in the year 1187 one was set up in the abbey church bury st edmunds from which we are told the abbot was accustomed to preach to the people in the vulgar tongue and provincial dialect164 the most ancient pulpit perhaps existing in this country is that in the refectory of the abbey now in ruins of beaulieu hampshire it is of stone and partly projects from the wall and is ornamented with mouldings sculptured foliage and a series of blank trefoiled pointed arches in the style of the thirteenth century the church of the holy trinity at coventry contains a fine specimen of a stone pulpit of the fifteenth century in rowington church in the county of warwick is a stone pulpit of the same age as that at coventry but much plainer in design at long sutton church somersetshire is a splendid wooden pulpit of the fifteenth century painted and gilt and the sides are covered with ogeeheaded niches with angularshaped buttresses between but the pulpits of this era may be distinguished without difficulty by the peculiar architectural designs they exhibit we now approach the division between the nave or body of the church and the chancel or choir this was formed by a beautiful and highly decorated screen sometimes of stone but generally of wood panel and openwork tracery painted and gilt above this was a crossbeam which formed a main support to the roodloft a gallery in which the crucifix or rood and the accompanying images of the blessed virgin and st john were placed so as to be seen by the parishioners in the body of the church and also in accordance with the traditional belief that the position of our saviour whilst suspended on the cross was facing the west the passage to the roodloft was generally up a flight of stone steps in the north or south wall of the nave but as the roodloft frequently extended across the aisles we sometimes meet with a small turret annexed to the east end of one of the aisles for the approach though the introduction of the latticework division between the chancel and nave may be traced in the eastern church to the fourth century we possess in our own churches few remains of screenwork of earlier date than the fifteenth century and it appears probable that wooden screenwork before that period was not common and that in most instances a curtain or veil was used for the purpose of division the roodloft generally projected in front so as to form a kind of groined cove the ribs of which sprang or diverged from the principal uprights of the screen beneath in long sutton church somersetshire is a splendid wooden roodloft elaborately carved painted and gilt which extends across the whole breadth of the church and is approached by means of a staircase turret on the south side of the church in the churches of great handborough enstone great rollwright and hook norton oxfordshire are considerable remains of the ancient roodloft and numerous other instances where it is still retained could be adduced sometimes this gallery was so small as to admit of the rood and two attendant images only and had no apparent access to it as that in wormleighton church warwickshire hardly a roodloft is however remaining of earlier date than the fifteenth century prior to that period and in many instances even during it the crucifix or rood and its attendant images appear to have been affixed to a transverse beam extending horizontally across the chancel arch this was sometimes richly carved and a beam of this description still exists in the chancel of little malvern church worcestershire an earlier date than the eleventh century can hardly be assigned for the introduction of the rood with the figures of st mary and st john into our churches though in illuminated manuscripts somewhat before that period we find such figures pourtrayed with the crucifix167 in the abbey church bury st edmunds the rood and the figures of st mary and st john which were placed over the high altar were as we are informed by joceline who wrote his chronicle in the twelfth century the gift of archbishop stigand167 gervase in describing the work of lanfranc in canterbury cathedral as it appeared before the fire a d 1174 notices the roodbeam which sustained a large crucifix and the images of st mary and st john as extended across the church between the nave and central tower168 illustration rood sherborne church dorsetshire all the carved wooden roods appear to have been destroyed at the reformation in compliance with the injunctions issued for that purpose we occasionally meet however with bas relief sculptures of our saviour extended on the cross with a figure on each side representing the virgin and st john but in a mutilated condition on the outside of the west wall of the south transept of romsey church hants and close to the entrance from the cloisters into the church is a large stone rood or crucifix sculptured in relief with a hand above emerging from a cloud169 this is apparently of the twelfth century small sculptured representations of the rood with the figures of st mary and st john still exist on one of the buttresses near the west door of sherborne church dorsetshire over a south doorway of burford church oxfordshire and in the wall of the tower of the church of st lawrence evesham illustration sanctus bell long compton church warwickshire outside the roof of some churches on the apex of the eastern gable of the nave is a small open arch or turret in which formerly a single bell was suspended this was the sanctus or sacringe bell thus placed that being near the altar it might be the more readily rung when in concluding the ordinary of the mass the priest pronounced the tersanctus to draw attention to that more solemn office the canon of the mass which he was now about to commence it was also rung at a subsequent part of the service on the elevation and adoration of the host and chalice after consecration171 but though the arch remains on the gable of the nave of many churches the bell thus suspended is retained in few amongst which may be mentioned those of long compton whichford and brailes in warwickshire where this bell is still preserved hung in an arch at the apex of the nave with the rope hanging down between the chancel and nave171 mention of this bell is thus made in the survey of the priory of sandwell in the county of stafford taken at the time of the reformation itm the belframe standyng betw the chauncell and the church wt a litle sanctm bell in the same generally however a small handbell was carried and rung at the proper times in the service by the acolyte and in inventories of ancient church furniture we find it often noticed as a sacringe bell but in an inventory of goods belonging to the chapel of thorp northamptonshire it is described as a litle sanctus bell a small sacringe bell of bellmetal with the exception of the clapper which was of iron was in 1819 discovered on the removal of some rubbish from the ruins of st margarets priory barnstable and within the last few years a small sanctus bell was found on the site of a religious house at warwick172 illustration ancient sanctus bell found at warwick passing under the roodloft we enter the chancel this was so called from the screen or latticework cancelli of stone or wood by which it was separated from the nave and which succeeded the curtain or veil which anciently formed this division of the church173 illustration stalls and desk st margarets church leicester we often perceive in the choirs of conventual churches as in our cathedrals on either side of the entrance facing the east and also on the north and south sides a range of wooden stalls divided into single seats peculiarly constructed the formul or forms of which were movable and carved on the subselli or undersides with grotesque satirical and often irreverend devices these were appropriated to the monks or canons of the monastery or college to which the church was attached the form of each stall when turned up so as to exhibit the carved work on the underpart furnished a small kind of seat or ledge constructed for the purpose of inclining against rather than sitting on and this was called the misericorde or miserere the formul or forms when down and the misericordes when the forms were turned up were used as the season required for penitential inclinations174 in front of these stalls was a desk ornamented on the exterior with panelled tracery and over the stalls especially of those of cathedral churches canopies of tabernacle work richly carved were sometimes disposed in winchester cathedral we have perhaps the most early chaste and beautiful example of the canons stalls with canopies over that are to be met with although a greater excess of minute carved ornament may be found in the canopies which overhang the stalls in other cathedrals in old conventual churches now no longer used as such the stalls have been often removed from their original position to other parts of the church and they appear to have varied in number according to that of the fraternity illustration misericorde all souls college oxford illustration brass reading desk merton college chapel oxford in the choirs of cathedral and conventual churches and in the chancels of some other churches a movable desk at which the epistle and gospel were read was placed this was often called the eagle desk from its being frequently sustained on a brazen eagle with expanded wings elevated on a stand emblematic of st john the evangelist eagle desks are generally found either of the fifteenth or seventeenth century notices of them occur however much earlier in the louterell psalter written circa a d 1300 an eagle desk supported on a cylindrical shaft banded midway down by an annulated moulding in the style of the thirteenth century is represented and in an account of ornaments belonging to salisbury cathedral a d 1214 we find mentioned tuellia una ad lectricum aquil besides the brass eagle desks which still remain in use in several of our cathedrals and in the chapels of some of the colleges at oxford and cambridge fine specimens are preserved in redcliffe church bristol of the date 1638 in croydon church surrey and in the church of the holy trinity at coventry other instances might also be enumerated sometimes we meet with ancient brass readingdesks which have not the eagle in front but both the sides are sloped so as to form a double desk of these examples of the fifteenth century may be found in yeovil church somersetshire and in the chapel of merton college oxford ancient wooden readingdesks either single or double are also occasionally found some of these are richly carved others are comparatively plain but all partake more or less of the architectonic style of the age in which they were severally constructed and from which their probable dates may be ascertained in bury church huntingdonshire is a wooden desk with a single slope and the vertical face presented in front is covered with arches and other carved ornaments this perhaps may be referable to the latter part of the fourteenth century a rich double desk of somewhat later date with the shaft supported by buttresses of openwork tracery is preserved in ramsey church huntingdonshire in aldbury church hertfordshire is an ancient double lecturn or reading desk of wood of the fifteenth century much plainer in design than those at bury and ramsey the shaft is angular with small buttresses at the angles and with a plain angularshaped moulded capital and base which latter is set on a crosstree in hawstead church suffolk is a wooden desk with little ornament supported on an angular shaft with an embattled capital and moulded base with leaves carved in relief this is apparently of the latter part of the fourteenth century the ancient wooden desks found in some of our churches must not however be confounded with a more numerous class constructed and used subsequent to the reformation proceeding up the chancel or choir we ascend by three steps to the platform on which the high altar anciently stood this was so called to distinguish it from other altars of which there were often several in the same church high mass was celebrated at it whereas the other altars were chiefly used for the performance of low or private masses the most ancient altars were of wood afterwards they were constructed of stone those of the primitive british churches are spoken of by st chrysostom by a decree of the council of paris held a d 509 no altar was to be built but of stone amongst the excerptions of ecgbert archbishop of york a d 750 was one that no altars should be consecrated with chrism but such as were made of stone and by the council of winchester held under lanfranc a d 1076 altars were enjoined to be of stone the customary form of such was a mass of stone supporting an altar table or slab and resembling the tombs of the martyrs at which the primitive christians held their meetings from which circumstance it became customary to enclose in every altar relics of some saint and without such relics an altar was esteemed incomplete illustration ancient pix ashmolean museum oxford pertaining to the high altar which was covered with a frontal and cloths and anciently enclosed at the sides with curtains suspended on rods of iron projecting from the wall was a crucifix which succeeded to the simple cross placed on the altars of the anglosaxon churches a pair180 of candlesticks generally with spikes instead of sockets on which lights or tapers were fixed a pix in which the host was kept reserved for the sick a pair of cruets of metal in which were contained the wine and water preparatory to their admixture in the eucharistic cup a sacring bell a pax table of silver or other metal for the kiss of peace which took place shortly before the host was received in communion a stoup or stok of metal with a sprinkle for holy water a censer or thurible181 and a ship a vessel so called to hold frankincense a chrismatory181 an offering basin a basin which was used when the priest washed his hands and a chalice and paten costly specimens of the ancient pix containing small patens for the reception of the host are preserved amongst the plate belonging to new college and corpus christi college oxford a pix of a much plainer description but without its cover of the metal called latten was until recently preserved in the church of enstone oxfordshire the body of this was of a semiglobular form supported on an angular stem with a knob in the midst and in appearance not unlike a chalice the monstrance in which the host was exhibited to the people and which has been sometimes confounded with the pix182 does not appear to have been introduced into our churches before the fifteenth century on the suppression of the monasteries and chantries we find it noticed in the inventories then taken of church furniture as in that of the priory of ely where it is called a stonding monstral for the sacrament and in that of st augustines monastery canterbury where it is described as one monstrance silver gilt with four glasses illustration sedilia crick church northamptonshire near the high altar we frequently find in the south wall of the chancel a series of stone seats sometimes without but generally beneath plain or enriched arched canopies often supported by slender piers which serve to divide the seats in most instances these seats are three in number but they vary from one to five and are the sedilia or seats formerly appropriated during high mass to the use of the officiating priest and his attendant ministers the deacon and subdeacon who retired thither during the chanting of the gloria in excelsis and some other parts of the service183 the sedilia sometimes preserve the same level but generally they graduate or rise one above another and that nearest the altar being the highest was occupied by the priest the other two by the deacon and subdeacon in succession183 we do not often meet with sedilia of so early an era as the twelfth century there are however instances of such as in the church of st mary at leicester where is a fine norman triple sedile divided into graduating seats by double cylindrical piers with sculptured capitals and the recessed arches they support are enriched on the face with a profusion of the zigzag moulding in the south wall of the choir of broadwater church sussex is a stone bench beneath a large semicircular norman arch the face of which is enriched with the chevron or zigzag moulding in avington church berkshire is a stone beneath a plain segmental arch norman sedilia also occur in the churches of earls barton northamptonshire and of wellingore lincolnshire from the commencement of the thirteenth century up to the reformation sedilia became a common appendage to a church and the styles are easily distinguished by their peculiar architectonic features some are without canopies and are excessively plain on the south side of the chancel of minster lovel church oxfordshire is a stone bench without a canopy or division and plain stone benches thus disposed are found in the chancel of bloxham church oxfordshire and of rowington church warwickshire in sedgeberrow church gloucestershire are two sedilia without canopies and in standlake church oxfordshire the sedilia three in number are without canopies or ornament in spratten church northamptonshire is a stone bench for three persons under a plain recessed pointed arch in priors hardwick church warwickshire is a sedile for the priest and below that one double the size for the deacon and subdeacon both are under recessed arched canopies quadruple sedilia occur in the churches of turvey and luton bedfordshire in the mayors chapel bristol in gloucester cathedral in the church of stratforduponavon warwickshire and in rothwell church northamptonshire these are beneath canopies and most of them are highly enriched quintuple sedilia sometimes occur but are very rare in the conventual church of southwell nottinghamshire are however five sedilia beneath ogeeheaded canopies richly ornamented a single sedile for one person only is occasionally met with but not often illustration double piscina salisbury cathedral eastward of the sedilia in the same wall is a fenestella or niche sometimes plain but often enriched with a crocketed ogee or pedimental hood moulding in front over the arch which is trefoiled or cinquefoiled in the head this niche contains a hollow perforated basin or stone drain called the piscina or lavacrum186 into which it appears that after the priest had washed his hands which he was accustomed to do before the consecration of the elements and again after the communion the water was poured as also that with which the chalice was rinsed the usage of washing the hands before the communion is one of very high antiquity and is expressly noticed in the clementine liturgy and by st cyril in his mystical catechesis187 we do not however find the piscina in our churches of an era earlier than the twelfth century and even then it was of uncommon occurrence but in the thirteenth century the general introduction is observable in romsey church hampshire is the shaft and basin the latter cushionshaped of a curious norman piscina this is now lying loose in a dilapidated state in the south apsis of the same church is another norman piscina consisting of a quadrangularshaped basin projecting from the south wall and on the south side of the chancel of avington church berkshire is a plain norman piscina within a simple semicircular arched recess the churches of kilpeck herefordshire keelby lincolnshire and bapchild kent also contain norman piscin those of all the various styles of later date are common they exhibit however an interesting variety in design and ornamental detail the drain of the piscina communicated with a perforated stone shaft commonly enclosed in the wall through which the water was lost in the earth as in the case of the piscina with its shaft taken out of the south wall of the chancel of the now destroyed church of newnham regis warwickshire sometimes a piscina was a subsequent addition to a structure of early date as in the old and now demolished church of strettonupondunsmore warwickshire in the south wall of the norman chancel of which a piscina of the latter part of the thirteenth century had been inserted illustration piscina newnham regis warwickshire the piscina is very common in churches even where the sedilia or stone seats are wanting and not only in the chancel but also in the south walls at the east end of the north and south aisles and in mortuary chapels as will be presently noticed it appears in short to have been an indispensable appendage to an altar sometimes the piscina is double and contains two basins with drains the one for receiving the water in which the hands had been washed the other for the reception of the water with which the chalice was rinsed after the communion189 in rothwell church northamptonshire on the south side of the chancel are the vestiges of a triple piscina the fenestella has been destroyed but the three basins with their drains remain across the fenestella or niche which contains the piscina a shelf of stone or wood may be frequently found this was the credence190 or table on which the chalice paten ampull and other things necessary for the celebration of mass were before consecration placed in a state of readiness on a clean linen cloth and this originated from the prothesis or side table of preparation used in the early church a recurrence to which ancient and primitive custom by some of the divines of the anglican church after the reformation occasioned great offence to be taken by the puritan seceders in some instances a side table of stone or wood was used for this purpose and a fine credence table of stone the sides of which are covered with panelled compartments is still remaining on the south side of the choir st cross church near winchester190 illustration ambrie or locker chaddesden church derbyshire the credence table or shelf above the piscina must not be confounded with the ambrie or locker a small square and plain recess usually contained in the east or north wall near the altar in this the chalice paten and other articles pertaining to the altar were kept when not in use the wooden doors formerly affixed to these ambries have for the most part either fallen into decay or been removed but traces of the hinges may be frequently perceived and a locker in the north wall of the chancel of aston church northamptonshire still retains the twoleaved wooden door sometimes shelves are set across the lockers in the east wall of earls barton church northamptonshire is a large locker divided into two unequal parts by a stone shelf inserted in it and in the north aisle of salisbury cathedral are two large triangularheaded lockers or ambries each whichtn5 contains two shelves within the north wall of the chancel near the altar a large arch like that of a tomb may often be perceived within this the holy sepulchre generally a wooden and movable structure was set up at easter when certain rites commemorative of the burial and resurrection of our lord were anciently performed with great solemnity for on good friday the crucifix and host were here deposited and watched the following day and nights and early on easter morning they were removed from thence with great ceremony and replaced on the altar by the priest in the accounts of churchwardens of the fifteenth and early part of the sixteenth century we meet with frequent notices of payments made for watching the sepulchre at easter192 sometimes the sepulchre was altogether of stone and a fixture and enriched with architectural and sculptured detail as in the wellknown specimen at heckington lincolnshire and the fine specimen of tabernaclework in stanton harcourt church oxfordshire at the back of the high altar was affixed a reredos or screen of tabernaclework costly specimens of which contained small images set on brackets under projecting canopies an alabaster table or sculptured bas relief placed just over the altar was also common the high altar reredos is still remaining though in a mutilated condition in the abbey church st albans it was erected a d 1480 and is perhaps the most splendid specimen we have and in bristol cathedral a portion of the high altar reredos is also left the chantry altar reredos is more frequently remaining even where the altar and alabaster table193 above have been destroyed rarely however in a perfect state in the seventeenth century the rich tabernaclework was sometimes plastered over probably to preserve it from iconoclastic violence in many of our cathedrals as at gloucester bristol wells and worcester and in some of the chantries attached to henry the sevenths chapel westminster specimens of the chantry reredos screen which appear to have abounded more or less with sculptured and architectural detail are to be met with and remains of the painting and gilding with which they were anciently covered may in some instances be traced in a survey of the priory church bridlington taken at the suppression we find noticed the reredose at the highe alter representyng criste at the assumpcyon of our lady and the xii appostells wt dyvers other great imagys beyng of a great heyght ys excellently well wrought and as well gylted five small chapels are also mentioned wt fyve alters and small tables of alleblaster and imags sometimes however the space behind the altar was occupied by a painted altarpiece on wood or panel a curious but mutilated specimen of which of the latter part of the fifteenth century is still preserved in the conventual church romsey over the high altar was the great east window of the church glazed with painted glass other windows in the church were also thus filled the subjects pourtrayed on the glass were sometimes scriptural sometimes legendary single figures of saints distinguished by their peculiar symbols are common figures of crowned heads prelates and warriors also frequently occur and on some windows are depicted the arms and sometimes even the portraits of different benefactors to the church with scrolls bearing inscriptions we have perhaps few remains of ancient stained glass in our churches of a period antecedent to the thirteenth century of this era probably are those curious circular designs which fill the greater portion of the lights at the back of the sedilia in dorchester church oxfordshire one representing st augustine and st birinus the first bishop of that ancient see another a priest and deacon the former with the host the latter bearing the ampull of this period also is some ancient stained glass in chetwood church bucks the ground of which is covered with a kind of mosaic pattern a usual feature in the more ancient stained glass and the borders partake of a tendril foliage whilst in pointed ovalshaped compartments forming the wellknown symbol vesica piscis are single figures of saints and crowned heads each clad in a vest and mantle of two different colours in the fourteenth century single figures under rich canopies are common but we begin to lose sight of the mosaic pattern as a background the stained glass in the windows of the choir of merton college chapel oxford is either very early in this or of a late period in the preceding century and exhibits single figures under rich canopies over the head of one of these the kneeling figure of a monk in his cowl is a scroll inscribed magister henricus de mammesfeld me fecit in the windows of tewkesbury abbey church are several single figures of this period some of knights in armour in the chancel of stanford church northamptonshire are single figures of the apostles in painted glass each appearing within an ogeeheaded canopy cinquefoiled within the head and crocketed externally and the sides of the canopy are flanked by pinnacled buttresses in stages specimens of stained glass of the fifteenth century are numerous in comparison with those of an earlier period we find such in the east window of langport church somersetshire where single figures occur of st clemens st catherine st elizabeth and of many other saints some splendid remains of painted glass of the fifteenth century are likewise preserved in the windows of the choir of ludlow church salop mostly in single figures amongst them is the representation of st george in armour of the reign of henry the seventh the figures of the virgin and infant christ may also be noticed towards the close of this century kneeling figures not merely disposed single but also in groups formally arranged may be observed as a composition wherein a better display of grouping and aerial perspective is evinced the splendid window in st margarets church westminster of the crucifixion between the two thieves and numerous figures in the foreground not grouped formally but with artistical feeling with the figures of st george and st catherine on each side of the principal design and the portraits of henry the seventh and his consort elizabeth in separate compartments beneath each kneeling before a faldstool may be noticed this window which in some of the details exhibits an approach to the renaissance style was presented to henry the seventh by the magistrates of dort in holland to adorn his chapel at westminster the era of the various specimens of ancient stained glass we meet with in our churches may generally be ascertained by the costume and disposition of the figures the form of the shields the mosaic pattern or other background and architectural designs of the canopies the pavement beneath the high altar was frequently composed of small square encaustic bricks or tiles whereon the arms of founders and benefactors interspersed with figures flowers and emblematic devices were impressed painted and glazed other parts of the church were also paved with these tiles the walls of the church were covered with fresco paintings of the day of judgment legendary stories portraits of saints and scriptural allegorical and historical subjects in the conventional styles of the different ages in which such were executed the costume and details being according to the fashion then prevailing these paintings have in most churches been obliterated by repeated coats of whitewash so that few perfect specimens now remain traces of such are however occasionally brought to light in the alteration and reparation of our ancient churches the subject of the judgmentday was commonly represented on the west wall of the nave or over the chancel arch and in the contract for the erection of the lady chapel st marys church warwick a d 1454 is a covenant to paint fine and curiously to make on the west wall the dome of our lord god jesus and all manner of devises and imagery thereto belonging the west front of the wall over the chancel arch trinity chapel stratforduponavon was some years back found to be thus covered but this painting with others in the same chapel was afterwards again obliterated199 a curious fresco painting of the last judgment discovered a few years ago on the west face of the wall over the chancel arch trinity church coventry has however been very carefully preserved and the coat of whitewash which tended to conceal it probably ever since the reformation has been judiciously removed the legend of st christopher represented by a colossal figure with a beamlike walkingstaff carrying the infant christ on his shoulders through the water was generally painted on the north wall of the nave or body of the church a fresco painting of this subject half obliterated is still apparent on the north wall of the nave of burford church oxfordshire and other instances might be adduced the murder of archbishop becket was also a very favourite subject an early pictorial representation of the thirteenth century of this event is still visible on one of the walls of preston church sussex it formed likewise one of the subjects represented on the walls of trinity chapel stratforduponavon and a painting of the same subject on panel executed in the middle of the fifteenth century was formerly suspended over or near the tomb of henry the fourth in canterbury cathedral200 several vestiges of ancient fresco wallpaintings more or less obliterated are still preserved in winchester cathedral the walls of our churches were even in the anglosaxon era embellished with paintings and such are described as decorating the walls of the church of hexham in the seventh century by the synod of calcuith held a d 816 a representation of the saint to whom a church was dedicated was required to be painted either on the wall of the church or on a tablet suspended in the church illustration ancient stone reliquary or shrine brixworth church northamptonshire in most of the large conventual churches and also in some of the smaller parochial churches shrines containing relics of the patron or other saints were exhibited these were either fixed and immovable of tabernaclework of stone or wood or partly of both or were small movable feretories which could be carried on festivals in procession of the fixed shrines that in hereford cathedral of bishop cantelupe of the date a d 1287 is a fine and early specimen in very fair preservation in the north aisle of the abbey church shrewsbury are some remains of a stone shrine which from the workmanship may be considered as a production of the early part of the fifteenth century this is much mutilated but the shrine of st frideswide in oxford cathedral the lower part of which is composed of a stone tomb the upper part of rich tabernaclework of wood is still tolerably perfect this is also of the fifteenth century of the small movable feretories one apparently of the workmanship of the twelfth century seven inches long and six high formed of wood enamelled and gilt with figures on the sides representing the crucifixion is still preserved in shipley church sussex and a small stone reliquary or shrine of the fourteenth century was discovered a few years ago and is now preserved in the church of brixworth northamptonshire illustration ancient organ the organ as a solemn musical instrument may claim a very early origin and has been in use in our churches from the anglosaxon era the ancient organs were small and all the pipes were exposed the phrase a pair of organs so frequently met with in old inventories and church accounts may probably have answered to the great and choir organ of a subsequent periodone instrument in two divisions the mechanism of the old organs was rude and simple compared with the improvements of modern times and the cost was small they were generally placed in the roodloft the church chest is often an ancient and interesting object sometimes we find it rudely formed or hollowed out of the solid trunk of a tree with a plain or barrelshaped lid of considerable thickness the churches of bradford abbas dorsetshire long sutton somersetshire and ensham oxfordshire contain chests thus rudely constructed sometimes they are strongly banded about with iron the fronts and sides of these chests are not unfrequently embellished more or less richly with carved tracery panelwork and other detail in the style prevalent at the period of their construction in clemping church sussex is an early chest of the thirteenth century the front of which exhibits a series of plain pointed arches trefoiled in the head and other carved work in haconby church lincolnshire and in chevington church suffolk are very rich chests covered with tracery and detail in the decorated style of the fourteenth century in brailes church warwickshire is an ancient chest of the fifteenth century covered with panelwork compartments with plain pointed arches foliated in the heads panelled chests of this century are numerous in shanklin church isle of wight is a chest bearing the date of 1519 on which no architectural ornament is displayed but the initials t s thomas selkstead are fancifully designed and are separated by the lock and a coat of arms beneath in the south wall of each aisle near the east end and also in other parts of the church we frequently find the same kind of fenestella or niche containing a piscina and sometimes a credence shelf as that before described as being in the chancel this is a plain indication that an altar has been erected in this part of the church and this end of the aisle was generally separated from the rest of the church by a screen the lower part of panel the upper part of openwork tracery of stone or wood similar to that forming the division between the chancel and nave and the space thus enclosed was converted into or became a private chapel or chantry for it was anciently the custom especially during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries for lords of manors and persons of wealth and local importance to build or annex small chapels or side aisles to their parish churches and these were endowed by license from the crown with land sufficient for the maintenance either wholly or in part of one or more priests who were to celebrate private masses daily or otherwise as the endowment expressed at the altar erected therein and dedicated to some saint for the souls of the founder his ancestors and posterity for whose remains these chantry chapels frequently served as burialplaces at this service however no congregation was required to be present but merely the priest and an acolyte to assist him and it was in allusion to the low or private masses thus performed that bishop jewell whilst condemning the practice as untenable observes and even suche be their private masses for the most part sayde in side iles alone without companye of people onely with one boye to make answer the screens by which these chapels were enclosed have in numerous instances been destroyed still many have been preserved and chantry chapels parted off the church by screenwork of stone may be found in the churches of bradford abbas dorsetshire and aldbury hertfordshire in which latter church is a very perfect specimen of a mortuary chapel with a monument and recumbent effigies in the midst of it chantry chapels enclosed on two of the sides by wooden screenwork are more common although no ancient high altar of stone is known to exist some of the ancient chantry altars have been preserved these are composed either of a solid mass of masonry covered with a thick slab or table of stone as in the north aisle of bengeworth church near evesham and in the south aisle of enstone church oxfordshire or of a thick stone slab or table with a cross at each angle and in the centre supported merely on brackets or trusses built into and projecting from the wall as in a chantry chapel in warmington church warwickshire or partly on brackets and partly sustained on shafts or slender piers as in a chantry chapel chippingnorton church oxfordshire sometimes a chamber containing a fireplace was constructed over a chantry apparently for the residence either occasional or permanent of a priest such a chamber occurs over the chantry chapel containing the altar in chippingnorton church and such also with the exception of the flooring which has decayed or been removed may be seen in the chantry chapel which contains the altar in warmington church in both of these chambers are windows or apertures in the walls which divide them from the church through which the priest was enabled to observe unseen any thing passing within the church illustration chantry altar warmington church warwickshire we often find an opening or aperture obliquely disposed carried through the thickness of the wall at the northeast angle of the south and the southeast angle of the north aisle this was the hagioscope through which at high mass the elevation of the host at the high altar and other ceremonies might be viewed from the chantry chapel situate at the east end of each aisle in general these apertures are mere narrow oblong slits sometimes however they partake of a more ornamental character as in a chantry chapel on the south side of irthlingborough church northamptonshire where the head of an aperture of this kind is arched cinquefoiled within and finished above with an embattled moulding in the north and south transepts of minster lovel church oxfordshire are oblique openings archedheaded and foliated and in the north aisle of chippingnorton church in the same county is a singular hagioscope obliquely disposed not unlike a squareheaded window of three foliated arched lights with a quatrefoil beneath each light we sometimes meet with one or more brackets with plain mouldings or sculptured projecting from the east wall of a chancel aisle or chantry chapel and on these lamps or lights were formerly set and kept continually burning in honour of the virgin or of some other saint and we also meet with rich projecting canopies or recessed niches with brackets beneath on which images of saints were formerly placed the use of the low side window common in some districts near the southwest angle of the chancel and sometimes but not so frequently near the northwest angle and occasionally even in the aisle has not been correctly ascertained it has however been conjectured to have served for the purpose of a confessional and on minute examination indications of its formerly having had a wooden shutter which opened on the inside are sometimes visible and on the south side of kenilworth church warwickshire is an ironbarred window of this description on which the wooden shutter is still retained209 the sedilia or stone seats so frequently found in the south wall of the chancel are occasionally though not often to be met with in the south walls of side aisles or chantry chapels when this is the case it is presumed the endowment was for more priests than one such not to digress into more minute particulars may suffice to convey a general idea of the manner in which our churches were internally decorated and how they were fitted up with reference to the ceremonial rites of the church of rome in and before the year 1535 the walls were covered with fresco paintings the windows were glazed with stained glass the roodloft and the pulpit where the latter existed were richly carved painted and gilt and the altars were garnished with plate and sumptuous hangings altartombs with cumbent effigies were painted so as to correspond in tone with the colours displayed on the walls the pavement of encaustic tiles of different devices was interspersed with sepulchral slabs and inlaid brasses and screenwork niches for statuary mouldings and sculpture of different degrees of excellence abounded suspended from aloft hung the funeral achievement at a later period even more common the banner helme crest gauntlets spurs sword targe and cote armour210 in addition to these were in some churches shrines and reliquaries enriched by the lavish donations of devotees and wooden images excessively decked out and appareled211objects of superstition to which pilgrimages and offerings were made and if in the review of the conceptions of a prior age viz of the fourteenth century we find a higher rank of art to be evinced and the style and combination of architectural and sculptured detail to be more severe and pure at no period were our churches adorned to greater excess than on the eve of that in which all were about to undergo spoliation and many of them wanton destruction for on the suppression of the monasteries and colleges to the number of 700 and upwards and of the chantries in number more than 2300 effected between the years 1535 and 1540 the abbey churches were not only despoiled of their costly vestments altar plate and furniture and shrines enriched with silver gold and jewels but many of them were entirely dismantled and the sites with the materials granted to individuals by whom they were soon reduced to a state of ruin some were even either then or in aftertimes converted into dwellinghouses and others or some portion of such were allowed to be preserved as parochial churches but the private chantry altars though left bare and forsaken were not as yet ordered to be destroyed by the royal injunctions exhibited a d 1538 such feigned images as were known to be abused of pilgrimages or offerings of any kind made thereunto were for the avoiding of idolatry to be forthwith taken down without delay and no candles tapers or images of wax were from thenceforth to be set before any image or picture but onelie the light that commonlie goeth about the crosse of the church by the roodloft the light afore the sacrament of the altar and the light about the sepulchre which for the adorning of the church and divine service were for the present suffered to remain by the same injunctions a bible of the largest volume in english was directed to be set up in some convenient place in every church that the parishioners might resort to the same and read it and a registerbook was ordered to be kept for the recording of christenings marriages and burials but beyond the suppression of the monasteries and chantries an act the effect of secular rather than religious motives little alteration was made during the reign of henry the eighth in the ceremonies and services of the church although the minds of many were becoming prepared for the change which afterwards ensued and in the reign of his successor edward the sixth a striking difference was effected in the internal appearance of our churches for many appendages were not all at once but by degrees and under the authority of successive injunctions discarded thus by the kings injunctions published in 1547 all images which had been abused with pilgrimage or offering of any thing made thereunto were for the avoiding of the detestable offence of idolatry by ecclesiastical authority but not by that of private persons to be taken down and destroyed and no torches or candles tapers or images of wax were to be thenceforth suffered to be set before any image or picture but only two lights upon the high altar before the sacrament which for the signification that christ is the very true light of the world they shall suffer to remain still and as to such images which had not been abused and which as yet were suffered to remain the parishioners were to be admonished by the clergy that they served for no other purpose but to be a remembrance the bible in english and the paraphrases of erasmus upon the gospels also in english were ordered to be provided and set up in every church for the use of the parishioners it was also enjoined that at every high mass the gospel and epistle should be read in english and not in latin in the pulpit or in some other convenient place so that the people might hear the same processions about the church and churchyard were now ordered to be disused and the priests and clerks were to kneel in the midst of the church immediately before high mass and there sing or read the litany in english set forth by the authority of king henry the eighth by the same injunctions all shrines covering of shrines all tables candlesticks trindles or rolls of wax pictures paintings and all other monuments of feigned miracles pilgrimages idolatry and superstition were directed to be utterly taken away and destroyed so that there should remain no memory of the same in walls glass windows or elsewhere within churches and in every church a comely and honest pulpit was to be provided at the cost of the parishioners to be set in a convenient place for the preaching of gods word and a strong chest having three keys with a hole in the upper part thereof was to be set and fastened near unto the high altar to the intent the parishioners should put into it their oblation and alms for their poor neighbours215 hence the primary introduction of desks with divinity books the litany stool and the charity box yet retained in some of our churches but as much contention arose respecting the taking down of images also as to whether they had been idolatrously abused or not all images without exception were shortly afterwards by royal authority ordered to be removed and taken away in the ritual the first formal change appears to have been the order of the communion set forth in 1547 as a temporary measure only until other order should be provided for the true and right manner of administering the sacrament according to the rule of the scriptures of god and first usage of the primitive church in this the term altar is alone made use of but in the first liturgy of king edward the sixth published in 1549 the altar or table whereupon the lords supper was ministered is indifferently called the altar the lords table gods board ridley bishop of london by his diocesan injunctions issued in 1550 after noticing that in divers places some used the lords board after the form of a table and some as an altar exhorted the curates churchwardens and questmen to erect and set up the lords board after the form of an honest table decently covered in such place of the quire or chancel as should be thought most meet so that the ministers with the communicants might have their place separated from the rest of the people and to take down and abolish all other byaltars or tables soon after this orders of council were sent to the bishops in which after noticing that the altars in most churches of the realm had been taken down but that there yet remained altars standing in divers other churches by occasion whereof much variance and contention arose they were commanded for the avoiding of all matters of further contention and strife about the standing or taking away of the said altars216 to give substantial order that all the altars in every church should be taken down and instead of them that a table should be set up in some convenient part of the chancel to serve for the ministration of the blessed communion and reasons were at the same time published why the lords board should rather be after the form of a table than of an altar expressing however in what sense it might be called an altar in the second liturgy of king edward the sixth amongst other important changes both of doctrine and discipline the word altar as denoting the communiontable was purposely omitted the peculiar formation frequently observable of the old communiontables seems to have originated from the diversity of opinion held by many in the anglican church as to whether or not there was in the sacrament of the lords supper a memorative sacrifice for by those who held the negative they were so constructed not merely that they might be moved from one part of the church to another but the slab board or table properly so called was purposely not fastened or fixed to the framework or stand on which it was supported but left loose so as to be set on or taken off and in 1555 on the accession of queen mary when the stone altars were restored and the communiontables taken down we find it recorded of one john austen at adesham church kent that he with other tooke up the table and laid it on a chest in the chancel and set the tressels by it218 it appears that texts of scripture were painted on the walls of some churches in the reign of edward the sixth for bonner bishop of london by a mandate issued to his diocese in 1554 after noticing that some had procured certain scriptures wrongly applied to be painted on church walls charged that such scriptures should be razed abolished and extinguished so that in no means they could be either read or heard in the articles set forth by cardinal pole in 1557 to be inquired of in his diocese of canterbury were the following whether the churches be sufficiently garnished and adorned with all ornaments and books necessary and whether they have a rood in their church of a decent stature with mary and john and an image of the patron of the same church also whether the altars of the church be consecrated or no but in 1559 the first year of the reign of elizabeth many of the injunctions set forth in the reign of edward the sixth as to the mode of saying the litany without procession the removal and destruction of shrines and monuments of superstition the setting up of a pulpit and of the poorbox or chest which latter was however to be set and fastened in a most convenient place were reestablished by these injunctions it appears that in many parts of the realm the altars of the churches had been removed and tables placed for the administration of the holy sacrament that in some other places the altars had not yet been removed in the order whereof as the injunctions express save for an uniformity there seemed to be no matter of great moment so that the sacrament was duly and reverently ministered and it was so ordered that no altar should be taken down but by oversight of the curate and churchwardens or one of them and that the holy table in every church should be decently made and set in the place where the altar stood and there commonly covered and so to stand saving when the communion of the sacrament was to be distributed at which time the same was to be so placed within the chancel in such manner that the minister might be the more conveniently heard of the communicants in his prayer and ministration illustration ancient communion table sunningwell church berkshire many of the old communiontables set up in the reign of elizabeth are yet remaining in our churches and are sustained by a stand or frame the bulging pillarlegs of which are often fantastically carved with arabesque scrollwork and other detail according to the taste of the age the communiontable in sunningwell church berkshire probably set up during the time bishop jewell was pastor of that church is a rich and interesting specimen communiontables of the same era designed in the same general style with carved bulging legs are preserved in the churches of lapworth rowington and knowle warwickshire in st thomass church oxford and in many other churches sometimes the bulging pillarlegs are turned plain and are not covered with carving such occur in broadwas church worcestershire in the churches of st nicholas and st helen at abingdon and in the north aisle of dorchester church oxfordshire the table or slab of the communiontable in knowle church is not fixed or fastened to the frame or stand on which it is placed but lies loose and this is also the case with an old communiontable of the sixteenth century now disused in northleigh church oxfordshire in an inventory of church goods taken in 1646 occurs the following item one short table and frame commonly called the communiontable on examining the old communiontables the movability of the slab from the framework is of such frequent occurrence as to corroborate the supposition that some esoteric meaning was attached to its unfixed state which meaning has been attempted to be explained under the colour of removing monuments of idolatry and false feigned images in the churches much wanton spoliation and needless injury was effected and this to such excess that in 1560 a royal proclamation was issued commanding all persons to forbear the breaking or defacing of any monument or tomb or any image of kings princes or nobles or the breaking down and defacing of any image in glass windows in any churches without consent of the ordinary and in the same year in a letter from the queen to the commissioners for causes ecclesiastical occasion is taken to remark that in sundry churches and chappells where divine service as prayer preaching and ministration of the sacraments be used there is such negligence and lacke of convenient reverence used towardes the comelye keeping and order of the said churches and especially of the upper parte called the chauncels that it breedeth no small offence and slaunder to see and consider on the one part the curiositie and costes bestowed by all sortes of men upon there private houses and the other part the unclean or negligent order or sparekeeping of the house of prayer by permitting open decaies and ruines of coveringes walls and wyndowes and by appointing unmeet and unseemly tables with fowle clothes for the communion of the sacraments and generally leavynge the place of prayers desolate of all cleanlynes and of meet ornaments for such a place whereby it might be known a place provided for divine service and the commissioners were required to consider the same and in their discretion to determine upon some good and speedy means of reformation and amongst other things to order that the tables of the commandments might be comely set or hung up in the east end of the chancel to be not only read for edification but also to give some comely ornament and demonstration that the same was a place of religion and prayer223 an ancient table apparently of this period of the commandments painted on panel but in language somewhat abbreviated is still hung up against the east wall of the south transept of ludlow church salop224 by the articles issued by royal authority in 1564 for administration of prayer and sacraments each parish was to provide a decent table standing on a frame for the communiontable this was to be decently covered with carpet silk or other decent covering and with a fair linen cloth at the time of the ministration the ten commandments were to be set upon the east wall over the table the font was not to be removed nor was the curate to baptize in parish churches in any basins in the visitation articles of archbishop parker a d 1569 we find inquiries were to be made whether there was in each parish church a convenient pulpit well placed a comely and decent table for the holy communion covered decently and set in the place prescribed and whether the altars had been taken down also whether images and all other monuments of idolatry and superstition were destroyed and abolished whether the roodloft was pulled down according to the order prescribed and if the partition between the chancel and church was kept the latter inquiry is explanatory of the fact why when the roodlofts in many churches were taken down the screens beneath them separating the chancel from the nave were left undisturbed by the injunctions of grindal archbishop of york a d 1571 all altars were ordered to be pulled down to the ground and the altar stones to be defaced and bestowed to some common use pulpits of the reign of edward the sixth are rare nor are those of the reign of elizabeth very common the pulpit in fordington church dorsetshire of the latter period is of stone the upper part worked in plain oblong panels and a kind of escutcheon within one of these bears the date 1592 the lower part or basement of this pulpit is circular in form the richly embroidered and costly vestments and antependia or frontals of a period antecedent to the reformation were in some instances converted into coverings for the altar or communion table or into hangings for the pulpit and reading desk in little dean church gloucestershire the covering for the reading desk is formed out of an ancient sacerdotal vestment probably a cope of velvet embroidered with portraits of saints the cushion of the pulpit of east langdon church near dover is made out of either an ancient antependium or vestment the material consists of very thick crimson silk embroidered with sprigs and in the centre of the hanging are two figures supposed to represent the salutation of the virgin who is kneeling before a faldstool we occasionally though rarely meet with ancient charityboxes of a date anterior to the reformation the churches of wickmere loddon and causton in norfolk still retain such226 at the reformation however they were first required to be set up in churches the ancient poorbox in trinity church coventry is an excellent specimen of the elizabethan era and the shaft which supports it is of stone covered with arabesque scrollwork and other detail peculiar to that age but most of the old charityboxes are of the seventeenth century illustration ancient charitybox trinity church coventry towards the close of the sixteenth century the practice of preaching by an hourglass set in an iron frame affixed to the pulpit or projecting from the wall near it began to prevail and in the succeeding century this practice became quite common in the churchwardens accounts

projecting from the wall by the side of the pulpit is an iron stand for the hourglass consisting of two circular hoops or rings of iron connected by four wrought iron bars worked in the middle and across the lower ring or hoop is an iron bar or stay in high laver church essex the iron stand for the glass still remains and is in fashion not unlike a cresset having only one hoop or ring encircling the top and supported on four iron bars which cross in curves at the bottom many other churches might be enumerated in which the stand for the hourglass is still preserved and the hourglass itself together with its frame is said to be retained in south burlingham church norfolk an hourglass within a rich and peculiar frame supported on a spiral column and apparently of the latter part of the seventeenth century is yet preserved in st albans church wood street london illustration hourglass frame shawell church isle of wight to the close of the sixteenth century the mode of pewing with open lowbacked seats continued to prevail the ends of these seats were not covered with tracery or arched panelwork but were plain though they sometimes terminated with a finial in the nave of stanton st john church oxfordshire are some old open pews or seats apparently of the reign of henry the eighth the backs of which are divided diamondwise and form a kind of latticework and the ends terminate in grotesque heads in harrington church worcestershire are some open seats of plain workmanship bearing the date of 1582 the church of sunningwell berkshire is fitted up with a range of open seats on each side of the nave without any ornament with the exception of a large carved finial at the end of each seat in cowley church near oxford are open seats of the date of 1632 which have at the ends finials carved in the shallow angular designs of that period all these seats are appropriately placed or disposed facing the east and none are turned with the backs towards the altar230 about the commencement of the seventeenth century our churches began to be disfigured by the introduction of high pews an innovation which did not escape censure for as weaver observes many monuments of the dead in churches in and about this citie of london as also in some places in the countrey are covered with seates or pewes made high and easie for the parishioners to sit or sleepe in a fashion of no long continuance and worthy of reformation231 the high pews set up in the early part of this century are easily distinguished by the flat and shallow carved scroll and arabesque work with which the sides and doors are covered in the directions given on the primary visitation of wren bishop of norwich a d 1636 we find an order that the chancels and alleys in the church be not encroached upon by building of seats and if any be so built the same to be removed and taken away and that no pews be made over high so that they which be in them cannot be seen how they behave themselves or the prospect of the church or chancel be hindered and therefore that all pews which within do much exceed a yard in height be taken down near to that scantling unless the bishop by his own inspection or by the view of some special commissioner shall otherwise allow from a paper found among secretary cecils mss232 it appears that in 1564 some ministers performed divine service and prayers in the chancel others in the body of the church and some in a seat made in the church and in the parochial accounts of st marys church shrewsbury a d 1577 is an entry for coloringe the curates pew and dask but no public notice of the modern reading desk or as it was called the reading pew occurs till 1603 when in the ecclesiastical canons then framed it was enjoined that besides the pulpit a fitting or convenient seat should be constructed for the minister to read service in and in allusion to the reading desk bishop sparrow in his rationale of the book of common prayer observes this was the ancient custom of the church of england that the priest who did officiate in all those parts of the service which were directed to the people turned himself towards them as in the absolution but in those parts of the office which were directed to god immediately as prayers hymns lauds confessions of faith or sins he turned from the people and for that purpose in many parish churches of late the reading pew had one desk for the bible looking towards the people to the body of the church another for the prayerbook looking towards the east or upper end of the chancel and very reasonable was this usage for when the people was spoken to it was fit to look towards them but when god was spoken to it was fit to turn from the people and so he goes on to explain the custom of turning to the east in public prayer in bishop wrens directions it was enjoined that the ministers reading desk should not stand with the back towards the chancel nor too remote or far from it the double reading desk is still occasionally met with as in east ilsley church berkshire where is a kind of double reading desk so that the minister can turn himself either towards the west or south in priors salford church warwickshire is an old carved reading pew bearing the date of its construction 1616 and in st peters church dorchester dorsetshire and in sherbourne church in the same county are reading pews which evidently from the style and the carved work with which they are covered were constructed in the early part of the seventeenth century the enclosing of the communion table in the church of stow in the county of norfolk by rails about the year 1622 is noticed by weaver who states that the vicar and churchwardens pulled down a tomb to make room for the rail in bishop wrens diocesan directions it was ordered that the communion table in every church should always stand close under the east wall of the chancel the ends thereof north and south and that the rail should be made before it reaching up from the north wall to the south wall near one yard in height so thick with pillars that dogs might not get in but we find the situation of the altar or communion table and the reason of its severance by means of rails more particularly noticed in the canons entertained by the convocation held in 1640 in these after an allusion to the fact that many had been misled against the rites and ceremonies of the church of england and had taken offence at the same upon an unjust supposal that they were introductive unto popish superstitions whereas they had been duly and ordinarily practised by the whole church during a great part of the reign of queen elizabeth and that though since that time they had by subtle practices begun to fall into disuse and in place thereof other foreign and unfitting usages by little and little to creep in yet in the royal chapels and many other churches most of them had been ever constantly used and observed it was declared that the standing of the communion table sideway under the east window of every chancel was in its own nature indifferent235 yet as it had been ordered by the injunctions of queen elizabeth that the holy tables should stand in the places where the altars stood it was judged fit and convenient that all churches should conform themselves in this particular to the example of the cathedral and mother churches and it was declared that this situation of the holy table did not imply that it was or ought to be esteemed a true and proper altar whereon christ was again really sacrificed but that it was and might be called an altar in that sense in which the primitive church called it an altar and in no other and because experience had shewn how irreverent the behaviour of many people was in many places some leaning others casting their hats and some sitting upon some standing and others sitting under the communion table in time of divine service for the avoiding of which and like abuses it was thought meet and convenient that the communion tables in all churches should be decently severed with rails to preserve them from such or worse profanations communion rails carved in the nondescript style almost peculiar to the reign of charles the first are preserved in st giless church oxford in the lady chapel winchester cathedral in the church of st cross near winchester in the choir of worcester cathedral and in andover church hants in which last instance the rails are composed of open semicircular arches supported on baluster columns with pendants similar to hip knobs hanging from the arches but specimens of altar rails of a period antecedent to the restoration are not often to be met with the reason for which will be adduced by the canons of 1603 the churchwardens or questmen were to provide in every church a comely and decent pulpit to be set in a convenient place within the same and there to be seemly kept for the preaching of gods word carved pulpits set up between the years 1603 and 1640 are numerous and the sides are more or less embellished with circulararched panels flat and shallow scrollwork and other decorative detail in fashion at that period and not a few bear the precise date of their construction in the nave of bristol cathedral is a stone pulpit ascended to by means of a circular flight of steps the sides are panelled and ornamented with escutcheons surrounded by scrollwork and it bears the date of 1624 in ashington church somersetshire is a pulpit with the date 1627 in bradford abbas church dorsetshire is a fine carved wooden pulpit and soundingboard and on it appears the date 1632 the date of 1625 appears on a fine carved wooden pulpit the sides of which are covered with semicircularheaded panels in huish episcopi church somersetshire in one of the churches at wells is a fine wooden pulpit of the date 1636 at the angles are columns of semiclassic design fantastically carved the panels are curiously ornamented with figures in relief and it is supported on a stand composed of a square and four detached columns above which are represented a number of birds with large beaks the soundingboard over corresponds in design with the pulpit a very fine carved wooden pulpit the sides of which are embellished with circulararched panel and scrollwork with the date 1640 and a soundingboard over is contained in cerne abbas church dorsetshire many carved pulpits of this era have however no assigned date they are commonly placed at the north or southeast angle of the nave but never in the middle of the aisle so as to obstruct the view of the communion table the commandments were again by the canons of 1603 ordered to be set upon the east end of every church where the people might best see and read the same and other chosen sentences were to be written upon the walls of the churches in places convenient on the south wall of rowington church warwickshire are sentences painted with a border of scrollwork the like also occur at astley church in the same county and on the walls of bradford abbas church dorsetshire are sentences of scripture painted in blacklettered characters within panels surrounded by scrollwork by the same canons the churchwardens were required to provide if such had not been already provided a strong chest with a hole in the upper part thereof having three keys of which one was to remain in the custody of the minister and the other two in the custody of the churchwardens which chest was to be set and fastened in the most convenient place to the intent the parishioners might put into it their alms for their poor neighbours in the retrochoir sherbourne church dorsetshire is a poorbox with three locks and a carved poorbox of the early part of the seventeenth century is preserved in harlow church essex in elstow church bedfordshire are the remains of a poorbox of the same period in clapham church in the same county is an old poorbox the cover of which is gone on

elizabeth and in general the pillarlegs were plain and not so bulging but the frieze or upper part of the framework on which the table rested was often covered with shallow and flat carved panel and scrollwork and sometimes with the date of its construction in the church of st lawrence at evesham the communion table bears the date of 1610 and round the frieze is carved an inscription stating by whom it was given in cerne abbas church dorsetshire is a carved communion table bearing the date of 1638 the communion table in godshill church isle of wight is supported on four carved bulging

table stands on plain bulging pillarlegs and on the frieze round the ledge is carved in relief an arm holding a chalice with the following inscription i will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord psa 116 v 53 anno dom 1632 as the rubric of the church enjoined that at the communion the priest should himself place the elements upon the holy table the custom of having a side table called the credence table for the elements to be set on previous to their removal by the priest to the communion table for consecration was observed in some churches in the latter part of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth century such table appears to have been introduced in the reign of elizabeth by andrews bishop of norwich whose model archbishop laud is said to have followed242 and it originated from the prothesis or side table of preparation used in the early church it was likewise as we have seen used at the sacramentals of the church of rome and on that account was strongly objected to by the puritans illustration table temp charles i chippingwarden church northamptonshire in the chancel of chippingwarden church northamptonshire on the north side of the communion table is a semicircular oak table apparently of the reign of charles the first standing on a frame supported by three plain pillarlegs like those of the communion tables of the same period and enriched with carved arched friezework similar to the arched panelwork on pulpits of the same period a plain credence table of black oak which from the style and make was evidently set up after the restoration still continues to be used as such in st michaels church oxford being placed on the north side of the communion table the objections of the puritans against many of the usages of the anglican church and their refusal to conform to such under the pretence of their being superstitious had no slight effect in altering the internal appearance of our churches in the middle of the seventeenth century and during the period their party had obtained the ascendancy and had succeeded for a while in abolishing in this country episcopal church government for among the innovations in discipline as they were called by the puritan committee of the house of lords in 1641 we find the following usages complained of the turning of the holy table altarwise and most commonly calling it an altar the bowing towards it or towards the east many times advancing candlesticks in many churches upon the altar so called the making of canopies over the altar so called with traverses and curtains on each side and before it the compelling all communicants to come up to the rails and there to receive the advancing crucifixes and images upon the parafront or altar cloth so called the reading some part of the morning prayer at the holy table when there was no communion celebrated the ministers turning his back to the west and his face to the east when he pronounced the creed or read prayers the reading the litany in the midst of the body of the church in many of the parochial churches the having a credentia or side table besides the lords table for divers uses in the lords supper and the taking down galleries in churches or restraining the building of galleries where the parishes were very populous244 in august 1643 an ordinance of the lords and commons was published for the taking away and demolishing of all altars and tables of stone and for the removal of all communion tables from the east end of every church and chancel and it was prescribed that such should be placed in some other fit and convenient place in the body of the church or in the body of the chancel and that all rails whatsoever which had been erected near to before or about any altar or communion table should be likewise taken away and that the chancelground which had been raised within twenty years then last past for any altar or communion table to stand on should be laid down and levelled as the same had formerly been and that all tapers candlesticks and basins should be removed and taken away from the communion table and not again used about the same and that all crucifixes crosses and all images and pictures of any one or more persons of the trinity or of the virgin mary and all other images and pictures of saints or superstitious inscriptions belonging to any churches should be taken away and defaced before the first day of november 1643 but it was provided that such ordinances should not extend to any image picture or coat of arms in glass stone or otherwise set up or graven only for a monument of any dead person not reputed for a saint but that all such might stand and continue by a subsequent ordinance passed in may 1644 it was prescribed that no roodloft or holy water fonts should be any more used in any church and that all organs and the frames or cases in which they stood in all churches should be taken away and utterly defaced under colour of these ordinances the beauty of the cathedrals and churches was injured to an extent hardly credible the monuments of the dead were defaced and brasses torn away in the iconoclastic fury which then raged the very tombs were violated and the havoc made of church ornaments and destruction of the fine painted glass with which most church windows then abounded may in some degree be estimated from the account given by one dowsing a parliamentary visitor appointed under a warrant from the earl of manchester for demolishing the so called superstitious pictures and ornaments of churches within the county of suffolk who kept a journal with the particulars of his transactions in the years 1643 and 1644 these were chiefly comprised in the demolition of numerous windows filled with painted glass in the breaking down of altar rails and organ cases in levelling the steps in the chancels in removing crucifixes in taking down the stone crosses from the exterior of the churches in defacing crosses on the fonts and in the taking up under the pretence of their being superstitious of numerous sepulchral inscriptions in brass nor did the churches in other parts of the country with some exceptions escape from a like fanatical warfare and in this many of our cathedrals suffered most but this was not enough our sacred edifices were profaned and polluted in the most irreverent and disgraceful manner and with the exception of the destruction which took place on the dissolution of the monastic establishments in the previous century more devastation was committed at this time by the party hostile to the anglican church than had ever before been effected since the ravages of the ancient danish invaders but as to other alterations at this time effected in january 1644 an ordinance of parliament was published for the taking away of the book of common prayer which was forbid to be used any longer in any church chapel or place of public worship in lieu of this the directory for the publike worship of god was established this contained no stated forms of prayer but general instructions only for extemporaneous praying and preaching and for the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the lords supper the former of which was to be administered in the place of public worship and in the face of the congregation but not as the directory expresses in the places where fonts in the time of popery were unfitly and superstitiously placed and at the administration of the lords supper the table was to be so placed that the communicants might sit orderly about it or at it but all liturgical form was abolished and the prayers even at this sacrament were such as the minister might spontaneously offer at brill church in buckinghamshire the communion table on an elevation of one step is inclosed with rails within an area of eight feet by six feet and a half and a bench is fixed to the wall on each side an innovation made at this period in order that the communicants might receive the sacrament sitting the communion table in wooten wawen church warwickshire though perfectly plain in construction is unusually long and large and appears to have been set up by the puritans at this period so that they might sit round or at it to the removal of the communion table from the east end of the chancel may be attributed the usage which in the middle of the seventeenth century began to prevail of constructing close and high seats or pews without regard to that uniformity of arrangement which had hitherto been observed and many seats were now so constructed that those who occupied them necessarily turned their backs on the east during the ministration of prayer and public service the erection of unseemly galleries which have greatly tended to disfigure our churches was another consequence of the innovation on the ancient arrangement of pewing after the restoration the communion tables were again restored to their former position at the east end of the chancel and in evelyns diary for 16612 we find the change of position in his parish church thus noticed 6 april being of the vestry in the afternoone we orderd that the communion table should be set as usual altarwise with a decent raile in front as before the rebellion the altar rails were now generally restored and in most instances we find those in our churches to be of a period subsequent to the restoration as the details in the workmanship evince in the church accounts of st marys shrewsbury for 1662 we find a memorandum that this year the rayles about the communion table wer new sett up and the surplice was made in wormleighton church warwickshire the altar rails have on them the date of 1664 and the communion table which is quite plain is of the same character and era but a return after the restoration to the former usages of the anglican church was not made without great opposition and accordingly we find objections stated to the bowing to the altar and to the east to the preaching by book to the railing in of the altar to the candles cushion and book thereon to the bowing at the name of jesus and to the organs as popishlike music and too much superstition250 when the rood was taken down at the reformation a custom began to prevail of fixing up in its stead or place against the arch leading into the chancel the upper part of which was in consequence blocked up by it and facing the congregation so as to be seen by them the royal arms with proper heraldic supporters but it does not clearly appear that this was done in consequence of any express law or injunction to that effect though it may perhaps have served to denote the kings supremacy we seldom however find the royal arms of earlier date than the restoration in the twenty years previous to which they appear to have been generally taken down in brixton church isle of wight on some plain wooden panelling between the tower and a gallery at the west end are the remains of the royal arms which from the style in which they have been painted with the rose and thistle appear coeval with the reign of james the first they are surmounted by a crown below which is an open sixbarred helme these arms appear to have been removed from their original position against the chancelarch and are now much mutilated in the church accounts st marys shrewsbury for 1651 is a charge of 1l 8s for making the states armes in anstey church warwickshire the arms of the commonwealth put up during the interregnum were taken down not many years back the little church of st lawrence in the isle of wight still retains the royal arms put up at the restoration in 1660 excepting the roodloft galleries we have few galleries in our churches of a period antecedent to the latter part of the seventeenth century at the west end of worstead church norfolk over the west door is a gallery erected in 1550 at the cost of the candle called the bachelors light at the west end of the nave in leighton buzzard church is a gallery erected in 1634 and at the west end of piddletown church dorsetshire is a gallery with the date of its erection 1635 from about the period of the revolution in 1688 we may trace the commencement of a custom still partially prevailing of setting up the pulpit and readingpew in the middle aisle in front of the communion table so that during the whole of the service the back of the minister was turned to the east and the view of the communion table obstructed but we have not found any pulpit thus placed of an earlier period we still retain in the anglican church the usage of placing two candlesticks and candles upon the communion table in compliance with the injunctions of king edward the sixth together also with an offertory dish of reading the lessons from the eagle desk and of saying the litany at the litanystool these practices are however more particularly observed in our cathedrals and college chapels than in our parochial churches in most of which they have fallen into desuetude to conclude in the language of the synod held in 1640 whereas the church is the house of god dedicated to his holy worship and therefore ought to remind us both of the greatness and goodness of his divine majesty certain it is that the acknowledgment thereof not only inwardly in our hearts but also outwardly with our bodies must needs be pious in itself profitable unto us and edifying unto others we therefore think it meet and behoveful and heartily commend it to all good and wellaffected people members of this church that they be ready to tender unto the lord the said acknowledgment by doing reverence and obeisance both at their coming in and going out of the said churches chancels or chapels according to the most ancient custom of the primitive church in the purest times and of this church also for many years of the reign of queen elizabeth the reviving therefore of this ancient and laudable custom we heartily recommend to the serious consideration of all good people not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the communion table the east or church or any thing therein contained in so doing or to perform the said gesture in the celebration of the holy eucharist upon any opinion of a corporal presence of the body of jesus christ on the holy table or in the mystical elements but only for the advancement of gods majesty and to give him alone that honour and glory that is due unto him and no otherwise and in the practice or omission of this rite we desire that the rule of charity prescribed by the apostle may be observed which is that they which use this rite despise not them who use it not and that they who use it not condemn not those that use it illustration a bloodie crosse he bore the deare remembrance of his dying lord for whose

in their stead for the administration of the holy sacrament of baptism a practice not authorized by the anglican church but rather condemned for in the canons set forth by authority a d 1571 it is provided that curabunt oeditui ut in singulis ecclesiis sit sacer fons non pelvis in quo baptismus ministretur isque ut decenter et munde conservetur and in the canons of 1603 after alluding to the

after the offertory shall monish the communicants saying these words or such like now is the time if it please you to remember the poor mens chest with your charitable alms 216 dr cardwell in his editorial preface to the reprint of the two books of common prayer set forth in the reign of edward the sixth observes the communion service of the first liturgy contained a prayer for the descent of the holy spirit upon the bread and wine and a following prayer of oblation which together with the form of words addressed to the communicants were designed to represent a sacrifice and appeared to undiscriminating minds to denote the sacrifice of the mass numerous therefore and urgent were the objections against this portion of the service combined with a large class of objectors whose theology consisted merely in an undefined dread of romanism were all those however differing among themselves who believed the holy communion to be a feast and not a sacrifice and that larger class of persons who placing the solemn duty upon its proper religious basis were contented to worship without waiting to refine 218 foxs martyrology 223 in compliance with the queens letter the following directions

book ii sect xxviii the attendants at public worship are enjoined to pray to god eastward the custom of turning to the east at prayer is noticed by many of the early fathers of the church and among them by st basil who remarks as to the doctrines and preachings which are preserved in the church we have some of them from the written doctrine others we have received as delivered from the tradition of the apostles in a mystery for to begin with the mention of what is first and most common who has taught us by writing that those that hope in the name of our lord should be signed with the sign of the cross what written law has taught us that we should turn towards the east in our prayers is not all this derived from this concealed and mystical tradition we all indeed look towards the east in
